I eventually started to find wasy to express my creativity by making templates used for paperwork sent to courts and judges look nicer. I started making really pretty and orderly arrangements of all the supplies I had to bring in to conference rooms for my attorney's depositions, mediations, ADRs etc. Soon, I was asked to start preparing and arranging the displays for everyone's important meetings, and layout more paper work because everyone preferred what I was doing.

""As a man,"" I like the thinker Jiddu Krishnamurti a lot, although he died some 35-40 years ago and I'm sure things he said are dated. He talks about how tradition is a trap for your mind, but you shouldn't simply mindlessly reject the tradition--you should understand it so well it becomes old hat and you're sick of it holding you back, basically.

To put it more aggressively, maybe there's something to knowing your enemy if you fundamentally disagree with their values and want to destroy their way of life.

I'd like to think we can more peaceably convince people to abandon it in favor of something they'd prefer more, all things considered, but, historically, these kinds of massive upheavals have always met resistance from the people who benefit from the old way of doing things, e.g. the US Revolution.

I don't know if you or anyone else will agree with me on this, but as at least a ""neurodivergent"" person who's arguably faced ""kyriarchical"" issues on that front, I think a lesson to be learned here is that we're not always facing, like, a xenomorph from Alien where it's just intrinsically ugly and hostile and inimical to life or whatever--often it's more of, like, a German shepherd, where, yes, it can be dangerous, but there are lovable aspects to it, too.

The point is you should be able to choose your job wether it’s being the candy or being the car salesman (don’t choose that regardless of feminism they are paid on commission a lot and it’s a terrible job for any gender lol)
There are also male roles that are shit too. Like as a nurse if there is a male nurse on the floor he is constantly asked to:
1. Pick things up and put them down
2. Deal with (or intimidate) the crazy ones. 
Being anti-feminist would be me recognizing this is relatively unfair and feeding into it. Being feminist would be me not automatically choosing big strong man ooga ooga for every damn physical task. Is this a fine line? Yeah it is. Welcome to life. It’s full of grey and fine lines. 

Anywho if the job personally conflicts with your views then for one don’t feed into them and politely decline what you can and then look for another job that can give you what is wanted and go. That’s about it.

It's why men have tried to keep us down for so long, our power is terrifying to them. They want to control us so badly because they fear our power. So don't let them take it.

I was an office manager at one point, haphazardly got into project management, then because an executive assistant to a fucking lunatic CEO that I got away from and haphazardly fell into doing sales in the tech sphere (b2b, so not consumer sales, fuuuuck that noise). Car salesmen are like, drivel compared to what I do. What they do isn't really that hard. They're kind of the joke of the sales industry, lol.


I have a GED, no college degree, and 98% of my colleagues have a Bachelors or higher. I also am one of the top performing sales reps, and I spend maybe 4 days in a month actually working. The rest of my time I'm doing whatever the fuck I want. I work remote. Right now I'm in Mexico for the winter because why not?


I've never made so much money for so little effort. All I had going for me was being smart enough, being able to learn on my feet, hold a conversation, and not be intimidated by anything. If you can learn, take objective feedback, and aren't afraid of a challenge, I recommend you give it a shot. What they do isn't something you can't do, and as a woman, I've got a little secret for you: you can do it better than them *because* you're a woman. Men can be dumb. That speaks more to their biological handicaps than you as a woman. And the best part? Most men have no fucking clue what to do with a woman who is direct, confident, can spar in a debate, and control a conversation.


It took 1.5 years of trying and failing to learn, and since then, my time has become my own, I have a lot of side projects and hustles that I spend most of my time on while barely putting any effort into my sales job, and I make 6 figures, and am not tied to an expensive region to live because my job is mobile.


Consider it. You'd be surprised the shit you're capable of. Feel free to DM me if you want to chat about it more. I'm writing a guide and helping out like 6 other people with this right how so I am happy to include you if you like!


But that being said, do keep in mind, these places would fall apart without a good receptionist. It's an easy job to trivialize, but the truth is, you do a lot more than you think. Don't harp on yourself. Sometimes you do what you gotta do. I spent like 6 years working a job like this that I knew was below my capabilities, but that job was part of my path to what I do now.

Women have won some rights that help us day to day but overall we are still beholden to the powers above us that dictate how we make our money and what we can/cannot do.

I think you’re super sweet to care and it makes me feel better that someone does at your age. Don’t go fighting battles if its going to cost you.

k7o74uk,t3_17mt9a3,2023-11-03 16:45:52,TwoXChromosomes,"I've worked as a receptionist (about 20 years ago) as my first job out of college. It was right after the dot com boom and bust in 2000 and it was hard to get any job. I was willing to take the receptionist job just to pay the bills but I'll admit that I felt kind of down about it at first.

 One of the heads of the company I worked for told me at my interview that the receptionist is the most important person in a company. You're the face the customer sees when they walk in, you're their first impression. People remember their first impression and it affects whether they decide to work with that company or not. You can literally make or break business. It's not just about looks (in fact, receptionists haven't always been ""pretty"", any girl could get a receptionist job in 1955 - ugly or not), it's also about charm, kindness, receptiveness and warmth. It's about being personable. It's about creating an atmosphere that people feel comfortable in. Can you do more? Is it easy (not for everyone)? Are you capable of more complex work? Or course. Yes yes yes.

But there is value in these customer facing positions. It makes them more welcoming and appealing to their customers to have someone who can answer their questions, give them directions etc. They all seem like simple and dumb things to you but to the customers there's no way to get these answers without a human with a heartbeat. I also think it's beneficial for everyone to work in customer facing jobs a few times in their life -it teaches you how to treat service people yourself (by seeing examples of what not to do) and it gives us humility. None of us are too good for any legal job that pays our bills. 

I also think one of the most feminist things we can do is to embrace and lift up the traits and attributes typically expected of women (like those expected in a receptionist job) that are often looked at as unimportant, or not valuable, or not difficult things to do in the workplace. Feminine qualities DO have a lot of importance in society whether people recognize it or not and we don't embrace them enough. It isn't easy being charming, warm and personable in the face of shitty customers or coworkers. It's a skill and it takes effort, practice and discretion. 

If you are successful working as a receptionist, your next employer will know a lot of things about you before they even hire you that will help you get in the door - that you're reliable, calm under pressure, responsible, personable (not required but a bonus to work with people who are easy to get along with), and able to put people in their place when necessary. None of these things are unfeminist. Change how you view your job and your job will change. Show people how to treat you at work by how you respond to their treatment. This can be the best job of your young life or the worst - you get to decide which is feminist as fuck.",maraq,t2_3moeb,1,0,reddit2
k7o7cpv,t3_17mt9a3,2023-11-03 16:47:12,TwoXChromosomes,"Give yourself a break.  You are 20 years old, and work with coworkers that are respectful, nice, and apparently happy with your work.

Just because you find the work easy doesn't mean it is. A good receptionist (especially in the luxury market segment)  isn't just about a pretty face.  It's about making clients comfortable and feeling attended.  You are the first person that new people encounter, and as such a very important part of the process. This may come naturally or easily for you, but don't devalue your contributions to the process.  This isn't to say that looking good doesn't help (reality, it *always* helps) but there's no shortage of pretty people who can't do the job.  

The amount of power that receptionists and executive assistants and secretaries exert on the world is really remarkable.  They control access to the levers of power, and often have institutional knowledge that far exceeds the people they work for.  Those jobs might not be the ones to get on the covers of magazines, but they are typically stable and well compensated positions.... And ones that can be leveraged into more, if you want.

You have an *excellent* opportunity here for being 20.  You are going to be around  a bunch of people who are very smart, who own businesses, who are very successful.  You can learn from them, network with them (to some degree)and possibly position yourself for future opportunities.

It's hard not to feel like that and not to see it when you are in a demographic that is discriminated against on those bases but there are ways that you can influence those people for the better just by being yourself around them. A lot of men are aware of injustice against women and simply don't know how to treat a woman in a way outside of what they've been taught. You may even be seeing men overcompensating to try and show you that they are safe.

Obviously this all exists alongside the fact that there are dangerous men among the safe men that we can't differentiate between and thus we have our own systems in place that we all know of to protect ourselves. We have our guards up with men because for centuries they haven't been safe. But there are men that want to be and that are on a physical level but are still learning on an emotional level. I think that anyone in this subreddit has the emotional capacity to determine safe and unsafe behaviors, but if you ever are uncertain I would recommend asking for help or reading about the topic/watching YouTube videos/other research regarding predatory behavior so that you can arm yourself with knowledge in defense against those who would wish to harm you.

It's not fair to us to have to mentally accommodate for the amount of men who truly do view us as objects, but part of changing this world is changing our men and changing our boys. It isn't fair. But it's our continuation in the human lineage of fighting for equal rights among all peoples.

If you allow yourself to feel as though you have successfully been turned into an object then that is how you will feel.

If you demand of yourself to feel as big as you truly are you will begin to feel it. Speak of yourself as divine and try not to let those thoughts take up space in your mind. Everyone is just a person living life the best that they know how.

Patriarchal standards Rob men of real relationships with women that could otherwise be incredible friendships and you have the chance to show them that you can be a beautiful girl and an integral, honest, and real friend. But with the guard up of you thinking that you are an object in their eyes and, please don't take this maliciously, but seemingly your own eyes, it's going to burn you out fast.

We're all carrying a lot of weight on our shoulders right now and it's important that we learn techniques to reclaim space in our own minds if we ever plan to change the world that we live in.

I would recommend starting with affirmations.

""I am not my thoughts. I am me. I'm exactly who I should be and I love who I am. People love me for who I am. People enjoy being around me because I exude happiness. People are nice to me and take care of me because I take care of them.""

Beautiful Chorus is an all-female vocalist band that I found that helped me through emotional release out of a really dark place during a BPD fueled episode that led to me shaving my head and nearly unaliving myself.

Tierra whack is a female rapper that changed how I view myself because her lyrics taught me what it meant to have real self-confidence. To feel like a real queen and to believe in myself to my core.

There is a way out of these feelings and you already have all the tools you need, you just need to use them in a new way. You are so capable and you are so valued. Please don't ever forget that. And don't let anyone tell you otherwise, especially yourself.

1) I also work as an administration assistant. However, I work for a college so it's a little less sexist and more liberally progressive in general. BUTTTTT it's a unionized position. My title is ""Secretary"" and they won't change it to Administrative Assistant, even though I specifically do a lot more for my department (which is a large STEM field) than any other departmental secretary of the same employment tier in the campus. But I get paid shit - 1800 per month, after taxes and benefits and union dues. Not even enough to pay for rent for a single bedroom apartment closer to where I work. So they call this shit 'pink collar' work and almost every position is stereotypically filled by women - because we're stereotypically neater, kinder, more willing to be in a supportive role, good with kids or whatever. And also dressing nicely and being the ""face"" of whatever you represent. 

2) I used to live in east Asia, and I would work in what are called ""host bars"" or ""western bars"" where they would serve expensive whiskey and office workers and businessmen in their suits would bring along their colleagues, flaunt their power and influence by treating everyone to drinks all night after work, and my job as a ""waitress"" was to serve them alcohol, dress in slutty outfits and just entertain them and flirt with them and manipulate them into buying and drinking MORE expensive alcohol (i've gotten 100$ tips, free food and gifts, even so call it sex work if you want, even though there was no touching of the women allowed). I'd been commodified as a foreign woman of mixed ethnicity, so over there I'm also ""exotic"" - and was assumed eastern european a lot because of it, so that came with the assumption that eastern european/eurasian looking women working in that kind of bar are all actually Russian prostitutes (ugh). I was called fat, was told I needed to wear more makeup, forced to sit in and contribute to conversations about topics I completely disagreed with....in my 2nd language, at that. It was often humiliating, exhausting, and mentally draining. But it paid my rent and helped me pay my way through 6 years of college - I have two undergraduate degrees - one in Linguistics and one in Neuroscience. No one there cared about my knowledge of language or brains or social or political news, or my perspective as a westerner while the East watched events in the US unfold (ahem 2016 election results made me cry in class, and then my professor decided to weigh in his HIS opinion of all those things - because unfortunately what happens in America will always have some residual economic, political and social effect on the rest of the world. 

&#x200B;

As I move along through different places and different industries I found myself picking out every misogynistic or patriarchal influenced thing in every job. Maybe it's a part of that company specifically, the environment and social set up of that industry (I'm prepping for Law school applications now. Which is still notoriously toxic and ""boys club""-ish even though there are many female lawyers now. A judge can simply refuse to continue with a trial if a female lawyer isn't wearing pantyhose, for fucks sake. It's stupid, and the only reason I'm doing it is because 1) I can, so I'll prove to everyone that I can who said I can't or shouldn't, and 2) because I want to blatantly disregard and live against the stereotypes and expectations of law school students and eventually lawyers, as a woman of color, or low-income bracket heritage, and as a person on the spectrum. Glass ceilings will be shattered everywhere muahahahaha lol 

&#x200B;

But no in all seriousness, you're going to find this everywhere you go. And so I say, if you can't beat em, join em. Until men start taking decisive action against each other to eliminate the systems THEY""ve enforced, then use that system to your advantage and milk the shit out of it. Make them mad over it, who cares. Charm all those gentlemen you work with. Make them do things for you so you don't have to, because they need to feel needed and want to take care of the poor weak pretty girl. Outside of the financial benefits of the position, enjoy working and not having to do much work and use your free time to work on other things. (I do about 3 hours of total work during my 7.5 hour day. I either relax and hang out with my dog under my desk, watch/listen to videos/movies/netflix, study for LSAT, study other things, read, draw, research things I'm interested in....

Then I go make more money waiting tables in the evenings. Another stereotypically female-dominated world. Smiling and looking nice while moving around gracefully among chaos. Letting male managers scream at you for dumb mistakes while they will turn over and smile and be so sweet to their favorite asshole customer who leaves a 5 dollar tip on a 80 dollar bill and makes ridiculous demands but acts like besties with the owners and expects special treatment. My restaurant also has Fox news blasting all day on one of the TVs next to the sports broadcasts. I hate it. But I'm there to make money, so I practice my scripts, dissociate in the bathroom, smoke a ton weed after my shift to decompress from all the sensory overload and exhaustion from masking, and count my tips.

Intellectual stimulation is “nice to have” when you’re doing a job day-in, and day-out, but sometimes it’s nice to not spend alll of your cognitive resources for the day on said-job, so that at the end of the shift, you’re not too drained to use those cognitive resources on yourself, however you see fit, whether that’s by studying in a rigorous academic program, fighting the patriarchy, mindlessly binging reality shows, or scheming up new and diabolical ways to undermine the feminist agenda… lol. 

You’re paying your bills and riding that wave without the brain-drain that comes with a lot of other jobs. And it’s so much easier to make sound financial decisions, and plan for your future when you can “leave work at work”, and know that “it’s just a job”, a chapter that will eventually close when you eventually move on to bigger and better things.

Sometimes that means scheduling appointments and having the paperwork ready before it's needed, sometimes that means a bit of emotional labor and letting your co-workers feel better by doing things for you.

They're also stuck in a soul-less job that involves sucking up to people's egos and faking a human connection, while competing against their fellow salespeople. Being kind to you is a way of connecting to someone else that feels real to them, without being forced or feigned in order to get ahead.

You see it a lot in older people who've recently lost a spouse, reaching out to anyone available because they're lonely and want to connect with someone. Social workers and Aged Carers do a lot of emotional labor along with the physical work.

A bad receptionist leads to loss of business and communication breakdowns that impact other people's ability to do their jobs.

A good receptionist makes everyone's life easier in a thousand little ways, and sometimes that includes emotional labor and letting people feel good about themselves when they do something for you.

When we get someone interviewing for a job, I'm always asked how they treated me upon arrival as a metric for how they'll fit in with the office. Were they rude and dismissive, or polite and appreciative? 

One of the nurses learned my favourite drink and buys it whenever she goes across the road for lunch. The manager and exercise physiologist ask if I want anything when they step out for their break.

Her job expects her to just be an object for the customers to ogle at, and is specifically related to the fact that (1) she is a woman, (2) the other employees are all men, and (3) a large percentage of the customer base is men. This is inherently sexist by design because they are using her to sell cars via the expectation that the male customers get to see a pretty woman when they come into the store (""sex sells""). The job itself is based around her being objectified by customers. She is lucky that the men she works with seem to be respectful, but that doesn't make her job not sexist.

And no, this isn't just internalized misogyny either. The fact that you are claiming this tells me that you are not taking her seriously. It's not internalized misogyny to recognize that the job is misogynistic by nature, not only due to what I mentioned above, but because she has very little else to do in the job. The purpose of it is clear. Her issue is that she feels bad for taking on a clearly misogynistic job.

You are refusing to accept that what she says about the job is true for some reason, and instead assuming that she is the issue. This is exactly what happens when many women are dismissed by doctors as being ""anxious"" or ""hormonal"" instead of being taken seriously. 

Maybe you should consider why you seem to automatically assume that women are wrong when talking about their experiences (and yes, that is exactly what you are doing in this case). Could she be wrong about the job? Sure, it's possible, though unlikely given that she has provided enough information to know that the job is misogynistic by nature. But I'm going to bet that if a man was talking about his experiences at work, you would be more likely to believe him and take him seriously. I'm not expecting uncritical acceptance here, but I am expecting that you not automatically assume that the woman is wrong because she didn't give a specific example of overt misogyny. Misogyny isn't just about a man physically harming or verbally insulting/assualting a woman, it's about being treated differently and ""lesser than"" for being a woman. Sometimes this isn't done directly, and often it is done covertly and unintentionally (like being less likely to be taken seriously simply because you are a woman).",MagnificentMimikyu,t2_tzcinxo,4,0,reddit2
k7of8uq,t1_k7oc5ja,2023-11-03 17:35:25,TwoXChromosomes,"having a hard time performing a role associated with historical and systemic oppression is NOT internalized misogyny. she is feeling awful pretending to be something she is not (a pretty subdued thing without much of a mind of her own) because she knows she (and most women who have had this role pushed upon) is not this. it is reductive of her personhood and can feel deeply humiliating and oppressive.

k7omas2,t1_k7og2wj,2023-11-03 18:18:37,TwoXChromosomes,"her job is not expecting her to be something to ogle at. she isnt a show room model, shes a receptionist that gets people coffee. appearance being a benefit to the job doesn't make it the core aspect of why someone is hired. I understand her feelings but people on this thread have zero information about how the job is structured. working with mostly men doesnt equate to automatic sexism. working a support role with mostly male clients does not equate to automatic sexism. I understand what youre claiming perfectly well but I dont agree with the logic that we should make people feel victimized for having to work with men. if she said ANYTHING along the lines of, my boss comments on my appearance, or customers are flirting with me, then yes I would 100% say its not a good environment. Thats just not what she said, though.

The fact you're jumping to me not listening to women or believing women as being the reason behind my opinion is showing a lot of your own bias. I didnt say anything about her being anxious or overreacting. What it seems like is that she feels she isnt achieving the standard that modern feminism is setting and thats creating internalized issues / guilt about her role as support staff. she said its obvious that shes an object but doesnt describe how. She also said object in response to the work load which is misleading.  Im not trying to undermine her. shes uncomfortable in the role, which is completely understandable and a shame. It just doesn't sound like there is any active misogyny there. maybe they should hire more women or she should ask for more responsibilities. but in short its ridiculous to say she is being victimized. you cant move the goal posts because of unrelated issues like dealing with doctors or blame external factors that dont exists. I would rather her feel empowered to do something than to waive her fists at an invisible monster and further resent her job, which again, seems to be one where the individuals there are supportive.

Im making these arguments because I feel that a broader perspective would indicate that this job might not be automatically worth criticizing. just because someone has their own feelings about a role that might not be a good fit doesnt mean that it MUST be due to patriarchal oppression. I do appreciate you mentioned that its the job itself but I just disagree with that.",philthechamp,t2_16sabn,2,0,reddit2

k7osxhd,t1_k7omas2,2023-11-03 18:59:17,TwoXChromosomes,"I understand now why you think that the job isn't necessarily inherently sexist, but I have to disagree. It could just be my own biases or a level of context that I'm reading into, but I still think that the job itself is sexist. It's not about working with mostly men, it's about how her role is determined based on the fact that she's working with men. It's because the male customers don't get to see a pretty woman selling them a car because the salesmen are all men. So the workplace does the next best thing and hires (presumably) the only woman there to just be at the front desk and not do much. It seems unlikely to me that the workplace would hire a man for this role. The fact that it's entirely sales*men* with no saleswomen indicates to me already that the there is a problem. The fact that the only woman there is working a job with almost no responsibilities adds onto that. It's not because it's a support role, it's because it seems to barely even qualify as that given that OP claims there are so little responsibilities. But like I said, it is possible that her workplace would equally hire a man for that job and that she is assuming the job is sexist when it isn't, I just think that it's more likely that sexism is at play. The fact that you seem to be saying that it's  definitely not sexist and is purely OP's internalized misogyny, rather than merely pushing back that we can't be sure it's sexist bothers me. How do you know that it isn't sexist?

You are once again assuming that sexism has to be overt, when that is not the case. Her boss doesn't have to say something gross to her directly to be sexist. He could be sexist by assuming that women are less capable and thus hiring the only woman into a job with hardly any responsibilities. He could be sexist by hiring her to look pretty even if he doesn't comment on her appearance - perhaps he knows better than to make such comments, or isn't looking at her himself but still understands that the customers might. The customers don't have to flirt with her for the intent of the job to be sexist, it would just mean that either she's lucky or the customers know better than to say something gross (if her male coworkers are respectful, their presence may deter such comments). You also seem to be assuming that if she didn't mention any specific examples of a e.g. a gross comment, then it didn't happen. I can't assume that it *has* happened, but you also cannot say that it hasn't.

You are also once again assuming that sexism must be intentional. Even if the job itself was not intentionally made sexist, and really just is a standard support position, the *effect* of such a position could still result in sexism. This job has put her, the only woman, front-and-center. This makes her more likely to be objectified by the male customers, since (1) they will see/interact with her due to being at the front desk, and (2) the other employees being all male means there is no one else for them to direct that attention to.

I'm not saying that you're saying she's being anxious - it was an analogy. I'm saying that you're automatically dismissing it as internalized misogyny instead of considering the possibility that she is right about the job. You state that it's internalized misogyny or a self-esteem issue, when you don't know that. Such jobs really do exist, but no employer is going to explicitly state that this is the purpose of the job! Also, using an analogy about doctors isn't moving the goalposts, and I don't even understand how it could be even if it were a poor analogy.

Finally, even if it really is just her own perception at fault, that doesn't mean she's not a victim, it just means that it isn't the job that's victimizing her, but rather the society around her that causes her to worry about such things. Men don't often worry about whether they were hired just to be objectified. This is not her fault, hence her being a victim in this scenario regardless of whether it is internalized misogyny or not. I was attempting to point out in my original comment that blaming herself for taking on a role that she views (whether correctly or incorrectly) to be misogynistic would be victim blaming. She is worried that she is at fault for possibly perpetuating misogyny by working the job she has, instead of acknowledging that if there was no misogyny, there would be nothing for her to worry about! It's the misogyny in our society that would be to blame here, not her.",MagnificentMimikyu,t2_tzcinxo,2,0,reddit2

Girl here, my reddit name is a misnomer.

Few years ago I was hired and put in an all male team to bring 'gender diversity' and 'equal opportunities'. There were four others, two married and two unmarried. The two unmarried acted as if they had never spoken to a girl before - they would bring in the topic of marriage and how they are 'actively' searching for 'someone' in front of me. Always. As if that was the only topic on this planet. Later, one even sexually harassed me.

The other two married men (the team leader being one of them) were no better. Only relief was that they didn't hit on me. They didn't allow me to take a sick leave, after asking a reason why I needed a sick leave in the first place. They didn't like it that I complained about the other team member's harassment to their boss (only because these people didn't listen to me). So they tried to put me on the bench. Good for me as another team within the organisation picked me up - and they were good to work with and were friendly and gave me good opportunities. 

Many organisations make this mistake - as if gender equality and diversity is just a number for them. The top level is happy and claims to be progressive if there are enough women hired.

ed2khex,t1_ed2gk44,2019-01-02 10:20:24,TwoXChromosomes,"I am retired now but I had a female boss who wasn't woman-friendly. Well actually she was two-faced and a back-stabber. I am a woman and worked as a scenic artist/prop fabricator. Me, the director and a female coworker were the only women in the department for a long time. It was tough working in a shop with mostly males and I say 'males' because some of them didn't behave like 'men'. They behaved like junior high school *boys* even though all of them were well over 40. 

I was hired in at a higher rate than probably all of my coworkers because I had a lot of experience and mad skills. I never discussed my rate of pay but some of the guys did. I think they did it just to see if I would tell them how much I made per hour. I was pretty surprised to find out that a couple of the guys only made slightly more than me and they had been working there for 16-17 years when I was hired. 

The director had worked in the department for many years and started out as a secretary as a young woman. She one day discovered that the two managers who had worked there when she did were stealing from the company to run their own scenic company. It just so happened that when she went to the fax machine she found a fax that had fallen off of the machine onto the floor. It sealed the two manager's fate and they had been working there for a very long time. This meant that she immediately became the manager then supervisor then director. This woman certainly didn't earn the director title by working for it. When I first started in the department I didn't know that the director had no theming experience. She didn't know anything about what anyone was actually working on and left it all up to the manager. 

I loved the work I did but hated the politics. So much petty shit thrown at the employees for no reason other than to stroke the director's ego. I'm glad I retired.",newsheriffntown,t2_10vcjr,40,0,reddit4

The composition of my team is 7 women and 5 men, which already makes a big difference in the culture and conversations. 

With the exception of myself, everyone on the team is a tech veteran and has been in the industry for 2-3 decades. The average age is 50+, whereas I'm in my late 20s, and the women are very motherly and mentoring. A female tech VP was my 1st mentor and she would always give me unsolicited career advice, such as never feeling afraid to ask for a promotion and a raise.

I don’t think there’s such a thing as “women-friendly workplaces” or anything along those lines. It’s a matter of having the owner (and it’s shareholders if applicable) caring about matters outside of themselves. 

Most places where specifically women’s needs are not met is the “boss” just not caring about needs that don’t affect them.   -in a different light - let’s say a small business for example a boss who closes the place of business down for holiday or vacation and the majority of employees want. What if one of the employees is paycheck to paycheck. It’s in the same vein as what we’re talking about but instead of gender inequality, it’s more of a socioeconomic inequality. 

What I’m saying is- you’ll find a “women friendly workplace” when you find owners (male or female) who are care about their employees- but that that point it’s just a “good workplace”. ",Shinyteeth,t2_4fnsp,0,0,reddit4

Any business that dismisses 50% of the workforce is doomed to fail in the long run, because that untapped skill you did not hire will work against you in another company that is willing to hire them.

Some of the responses here list things as family friendly work hours and so on as women-friendly, but those work hours apply to both men and women. Usually those jobs thrive on competition. Some, usually high paying high skill jobs are very time consuming, take a lot of skills and are very competitive so you wont have family friendly work hours, not for men and not for women. You trade your time to start a family or time with your family to compete in the job world - that is why they pay so high.

If a female-heavy career like nurses had a women's club I doubt that would be allowed, but if the men wanted to support each other that would make their experience more positive in the industry. 

Keep in mind that women may seem like they get an upper hand during interview stages, but were more likely discouraged from getting involved in their passion at a younger age and may not have had access to the GCSEs / A-levels that their male counterparts did.

So if you live in a place where 50% of people are white and 50% are black (heavily simplified for sale of my argument), you expect to see a similar ratio in the workplace. 

I think that ideally governments would keep data and do periodic audits of companies. In this audit, they would simply do a numbers check and if found to be drastically different from the population (say there are 75% blacks and 25% whites), they would examine all submitted resumes to verify that the company is not passing over qualified candidates based on colour alone. 

I agree that companies should hire the most qualified person. But when judging qualifications it's easy to let biases get in the way. This has been shown in experiments where people submit the same resume but with a different name. ",TheSorcerersCat,t2_1wq20oua,2,0,reddit4

It’s also something most older job seekers wouldn’t want to exclude from their own resume. For example, if you’ve got 20+ years of experience in the industry, then people know you’re at least 40-something, if not 50- or 60-something. But that same experience is also a good selling point, even if it identifies you as an older worker. I don’t know how you get around that obstacle of sharing your relevant work experience without giving away your age, or throwing away the importance of “experience”

Just for example, suppose all applicants are asked to list ONLY their 3 most important work experiences and check a box indicating:

* less than 1 year at employer

* 1-3 years at employer 

* more than 3 years at employer

This system would obscure an applicant’s age beyond age 30 (assuming an average person could graduate at 21 years old and have at least 9 years experience. 21 + 9 = 30. But obviously this same system could also accurately describe older applicants who graduated college late in life, had much more than 3 years experience at each job, etc. Basically, this system allows you to distinguish between recent college grads with little to zero experience and more experienced job seekers, but it doesn’t allow you to distinguish between a 30-year old “journeyman” and a 60-year old “grizzled vet” of the industry.

Is that system fair? Does it punish some older jobs seekers? For example, what if you are a 60-year old job seeker applying for a sales position at a commercial plumbing supply company. Over your long life, you worked as a plumber for 30 years, but due to the nature of the industry, you worked for 12 different companies in short little stints of 2 years here, 5 years there, 18 months another place. More recently, you worked sales at some other commercial plumbing supply companies: 2 years at ABC Plumbing Supply and 2 years at Best Value Plumbing supply. My age-obscuring resume system forces this older applicant to make lots of tough choices that short sell their own experiences:

* do I only report one experience working as a plumber, and the two sales positions? 

* do I choose two plumbing positions and one sales position?

* do I report the plumbing companies I worked for the longest, to maximize my recorded experience? Or choose the companies with the best reputation, even if it further short changes my years of experience?

* or do I summarize my work experience, saying I have 32 years experience as a plumber and 4 years experience in commercial plumbing supply sales, but risk giving away my age?",,,11,0,reddit4

On the IT part: I agree it's mostly a male industry, with the amount of effort going into encouraging women to work in IT, the interest seems to be rather low. I've met quite a few women in tech and I have to say that at least 60% of them were not at all enthusiastic about it (no hobby type interest, no drive to try new tech on their free time and similar), even though they worked in it. I don't know why this is really. I volunteer in a local program to teach underprivileged people IT. Underprivileged in a loose sense, nearly everyone is classified underprivileged in it as long as they are not a straight white adult male (being one myself this is annoying). I like the teaching but I'm considering leaving because it feels backwards, but I also meet some great people there (like the lady who told me the ending thought on my comment above).

That being said in my current job, every other role than IT is female dominated, some of them by a larger ratio than the IT part is male dominated (i.e. our finance department has 1 man to nearly 60 women)",myliltoehurts,t2_1y320c20,1,0,reddit4

ed3ao8h,t1_ed2oxmx,2019-01-02 18:09:16,TwoXChromosomes,"While I agree that is not kind and intrinsically shitty, I think it is a combination of a few things. The first being that men do it to each other. I know everyone has heard how guys talk to each other, full of the worst insults meant in good fun and just general fucking around, but it is hard to draw the line for some people. I'm 22 and am a manager at an Escape Room in Dallas and I have a few female employees that I work with. I am conscious that a lot of the times we push the line with each other in terms of teasing, name-calling, and non-serious insulting. At the same time we go through this verbal sparring I always apologize profusely any time I even brush up against a female employee so they don't have a misunderstanding. 

I think the other factor in play here is the general political climate. Which is in no way an excuse, don't get me wrong here, but it does factor in. Men use that extreme joking/insulting nature to build up friendships and I don't want people to feel left out, but at the same time I am scared that some random accidental touch could land me in hot water. There have been bets going on over how long it would take me to ask out a girl. It's not something that is inherently demeaning but I can obviously see how it can come across that way in conjunction with the other things women have to deal with.
I guess in the end it is different for me since everyone at the company 35< and basically everyone is a good person. But most of the men here are vigilant about touching but also trying to be inclusive verbally the way we know how. 

I absolutely do NOT want to minimize what you, and other women, have gone through/will go through.

I am an engineer and I've worked at a whopping two companies, the first was a hostile work environment towards women and the second is what I would call woman friendly.  The difference between them is so drastic that when I started at my second company (the friendly one) I was shocked that you could actually work without wanting to run to your car every day to cry.  Add to this that we have great maternity leave, super flexible work schedules and that the company actively tries to be welcoming to women, it is really a great place to work.  That being said, the opportunities are not equal.  While my company really does reach out to try to hire and retain women, all the women engineers are hired into what I call 'support' engineering roles, so not really technical.  This is quality assurance, systems, supplier management, etc.  The men get all the design roles and R&D work.  The hurdle to switch into that type of work from my role is extremely high, despite that design is what I did at my last job for 12 years.  So while the work environment is definitely more woman friendly and women are comfortable here, we still don't have the same career opportunities.

They hired a young engineer who graduated top of her class specialized in solar and wind energies. But in meetings, clients wouldn't speak to her and would instead speak to her supervisor who knew very little about the details. 

However, the supervisor wouldn't stand up for her. He would pretend to answer their questions. He never directed the client to speak to his expert. He was very nice to her and very appropriate and she was paid well. But, she was not treated equally by the client and the boss blatantly allowed it to happen.

Likewise if she tried to phone someone to collect information she was treated as a receptionist. She had to resort to emailing her clients and signing off with her last name, which was masculine (think Grayson). 

After some time she felt as if the boss wasn't supporting her. Because he wasn't. And all the stress of trying to perform well when the client was unhelpful and the boss was unsupportive got to her.

I think this is a really complex topic that involves way more than filling quotas. Women are outnumbered as CEOs, on boards, in government. Why is that? Are men smarter?

Yes, there are certain jobs where we would expect to see some statistical bias in favor of a given gender but in many cases, we don't see a statistical bias we see monoculture. It's not that in some jobs men slightly outnumber women or women slightly outnumber men, it's that there are jobs where there are all men or all women (or 99.87% men to 0.13% women)  


Just because women are more agreeable than men on average doesn't mean that there aren't less agreeable women or more agreeable men, in fact, there are so many people in the population that we should see thousands of even rare deviations to the average.   


And men have proven nothing time and time again we've seen inexcusable biases towards men result in incompetent men being promoted or hired for positions they are completely unsuitable for whilst perfectly competent women struggle to get the recognition they deserve. All because men are just assumed to already be the more competent and assumed to have better performance. Then we have assumptions about jobs that some jobs require the skill set of the average male, but it turns out that when a woman is given a chance in the field she opens up a whole new method within it because we were wrong.

Why does it seem unlikely that these women didn't just get there on talent alone, why do you assume they needed help?

Furthermore, when it comes to customer service roles, you aren't taking into consideration how the rest of society interacts with women and men.

Customer service is usually favourable towards women because people interact with men differently to women. Men within customer service roles usually face more aggression, conflict, threats of physical harm, and are seen as less masculine for fulling a ""serving role"".  Women are more likely to be objectified, sexually harassed and belittled. However, they can use this to their advantage because they're fulfilling societies expectation. Female ""affect"" within a customer service role (not saying they sound sexually suggestive or however that can be twisted) diffuses conflict, encourages compliance and acceptance with the customer which allows the customer service provider to fix/ record/ advise or do whatever their role requires them to do. If the customer is working with the service provider, everything becomes much easier and the provider can focus on providing excellent customer service, therefore reaching the previously mentioned KPIs.",BlackSongTattoo,t2_m24msi0,4,0,reddit4

It wasn't reported or anything but we had a long talk about how she was being distant for a few weeks which she only took as me asking for more sex even though that was pretty much the least of my worries. She was apparently having some sort of internal crisis where she felt like a slut for getting horny so easy and instead of just talking to me about it she pulled back and wouldn't even sit next to me on the couch. After a long talk with mostly me being confused and her not telling me what was wrong I finally managed to get her to cuddle and it escalated from there. 

Later she accused me of being manipulative and rapey because she consented after our very one sided talk and regretted consenting. She also basically said that she almost never wanted sex and that she just couldn't help herself around me like I had some sort of power over her. Naturally we aren't together anymore but I'm glad I got out when I did or one of those times probably would have been a full on accusation. 

This was long winded but it shows the amount of messed up consensual sex has to be for someone to later flip on you. She was one of the most easily turned on girls I've ever been with but the entire time we were together apparently she was slut shaming herself and blaming me for being too tempting. This isn't the sort of thing that is common in relationships and isn't the sort of resentment that can build up during casual sex.

I work a trade job at a big manufacturing plant (we've currently got about 6k spread throughout the buildings) but when I first hired in we were at about 3k and, not only was I the first woman to be hired in my department in over 10 years, I was one of about 30 women out of the 1k workers that walked the halls of my building. I saw a few women semi-regularly but it was no more than a 'hi' in the halls.


Going in everyday was a fight and I had to mentally prepare myself for it. My mood would sour as soon as I badged in and I'd have to walk to my lab while staring straight ahead. The amount of sexual harassment I endured made my out of work friends visibly cringe. If I was wearing latex gloves (which I have to for certain things) I'd immediately have some old male coworker (everyone in my department at the time was a male 45-65 y/o) asking if it turned me on to wear them or if I had a latex fetish; different comment everytime but always something similar. I had an ad for workout clothes on my screen (was looking up something GD&T related) and a coworker was staring at my screen for whatever reason, came over and pointed at the ad and asked if I ever thought about doing stripperobics because I'd look good on a pole (let me clarify that this was a normal Nike style ad). Comments about how nice my body looked in outfits, comments about how I'm a woman so I should bake stuff to bring in and they'd all been waiting patiently, they bragged about how they chased off all of the other women, if we had meetings they would tell me I could sit on their lap (Every. Damn. Time. It was like a race to see who could say it). Then I'd go out into the halls and have men telling me to smile or commenting on how they hadn't seen me before and how had they missed such a pretty young thing? Or elbowing the person next to them and asking when their department is going to 'get one of those' while pointing at me.


And when I went to HR? ""Yeah, that building is really bad. If you give us names we can come in and talk to them. They probably need a refresher course on harassment.""


Yeah, fuck that. So I literally just started telling people to fuck off and saying I wouldn't be in a lab with certain people. I didn't have a supervisor when I first started and when I finally got one he was worse than not having one. I had to be angry for 8 hours out of my day so people found it unpleasant to talk with me; that was the only way to get it to stop. I asked them multiple times firmly, ""Hey, I don't appreciate comments like that."" and every time they would play dumb. But I stuck it out and here I am!

ed2j476,t1_ed2hw2v,2019-01-02 09:37:17,TwoXChromosomes,"Yup. A little over a year ago, I was asked to take on the job of somebody who had recently been fired. I kept my title and my pay, but essentially had a new role. This was all quick and super unexpected, and I was told we would talk details later. In order to free me up to do my new role, a male was hired to replace me in my previous role. There were a lot of red flags with this new guy, which I expressed to HR, but I was ignored. 

My boss left a couple weeks later because her new boss was a giant ass with a serious “old boys club” mentality. On her way out, she informed me my replacement was making 10% more than I was, and said her boss had hired the new guy and set his compensation without her having any say. 

The new guy was useless. I was working 50+ hours per week to make up for my boss quitting and having a trainee, plus trying to figure out my new job. The new guy kept asking to leave early/come in late. He had no common sense, and despite saying he had extensive office experience, was either the dumbest or laziest man who ever lived. And he despised taking direction from me.

I had to fight with HR and my former boss’s boss (who was then temporarily my direct supervisor) to convince them it wasn’t fair to hire somebody with the same or less qualifications, doing less work than me, who I was running circles around and pay him 10% more. And when I say fight, I mean the jerk that hired this useless tit was yelling at me in his office over it and I refused to back down. I was livid. They had to create a new position for me in order to justify raising my pay so I was being fairly compensated and making just barely more than that new guy.  

I’m now “that girl” at my office, and management has been trying to get rid of me ever since (I got pregnant shortly after this all transpired, and I’m expecting to be laid off the second my maternity leave ends). And the guy who was my replacement? He made it 6 months, required multiple coaching sessions by management, then came in early one day before anybody else, emailed a letter of resignation to half a dozen people, and walked out.

Larger companies have to track, report to the government and post for their employees information about the wage gap at the company.

My employer’s HR is freaking out because they had a tactic to vastly underpay people if they could get away with it. They would intentionally lowball (ex, offer $60k and 2 weeks vacation when everyone else in the role makes $100k and gets 4 weeks of vacation) in the hopes that the candidate would be desperate or naive enough to accept it.

Of course the assholes you refer to do exist (and are common) but that can't be a sufficient reason in and of itself to disregard all impacts of hormone differences

Also I strongly disagree that competition is exclusively a force for bad. All the evidence of thousands of years of recorded history points to the opposite conclusion.

I know how you feel too. I worked in a male dominated field and had to listen to their sexist remarks. I either ignored them or told them to fuck off. I found out just what pigs men can be. 

When I started working in a theme park in a mostly male department it wasn't quite as bad but the shit was still there. I was hired for my experience and skills and at the time there was only one other woman working there other than the director who is a woman. Not sure if she still works there because I'm retired now.

I never felt that I had anything to prove to anyone other than my boss and she never went around looking at my work. The lead and manager were in charge of that and in all the years I worked there I never had any complaints about my work. 

Working with the guys proved to be a challenge sometimes though. Theme parks have certain rules about the things people can say to each other, rules about how to behave in the workplace. If these rules are broken then HR will step in. The department I worked in was semi-construction meaning that we were in charge of doing faux finishes, fabricating props, repairing sets, building sets, etc. All of the guys had carpentry experience, some more than others. Some could do basic painting and things like that but none of them could do faux finishes when I was hired. This is very important for a theme park. I had a lot of experience in this plus I too have carpentry skills and other things like building props, knowledge of paints, brushes, all sorts of stuff. 

I worked with guys who were over the age of 40. They were supposed to be mature but I swear to god there were times when I felt like I was in a junior high school. In the back of the scenic/theming shop is a sign shop and many times employees from various other departments would come over to pick up signage or check on a sign. So many times when a pretty lady would walk through our shop, she was like a deer walking past a group of starving wolves. It was embarrassing. Guys would knock themselves out trying to 'help' her. I can't even imagine what these women must have thought. Like, my god what kind of place *is* this???

The guys I worked around were absolute disgusting pigs and should have been fired for the shit they would say but they weren't. I have seen one guy at least grab his crotch when he was standing in the doorway of the shop watching girls walk by on their way to the cafeteria. I just shook my head. When the lead would come out of his office and say something to someone, the crotch-grabbing guy would say under his breath, ""lick my nuts"". He didn't think anyone heard him but I did. 

One of the worst things I saw while working there was one day I walked out of the shop to head to where the paints were stored. We were responsible for repairing and repainting props that are at Give Kids The World. There was a pelican, a dolphin and a few other animal props. I walked out to see my male coworkers laughing and humping these props. These guys weren't college age either. Two guys were in their forties, two were in their sixties. I couldn't believe what I was seeing and I turned around and went back in the shop. This kind of shit went on all the time and I tell you, because of their behavior it made me hate being around them. Towards my retirement things got worse because I stopped talking to all of them. They knew I was sick of them so two of them began sabotaging my projects. They also would spill coffee on my work station and sit all the big trash bins on it. 

I took the matter to HR and the guys were talked to but by time it didn't matter any more. I knew I was out of there for good. Shortly after I left, three of the guys retired and a couple of years after *that*, another guy was fired. I'm sure it wasn't because he was so mature.  ",newsheriffntown,t2_10vcjr,2,0,reddit4

>What I'm disagreeing isn't with some level of argument- just your reply that made no sense in the context of feminism because your comment was basically trying to do a ""ha gotcha"" but failed because people/feminism DO notice men in power now and question their legitimacy as just inheriting from privileges and institutional racism.

It wasn't a gotcha question it was a genuine attempt to identify a bias. Instead of calling the OP out for a bias I wanted to see if there was one there, I don't like pushing positions my opponents don't hold onto them, it only serves to cause problems and is dishonest. 

You are correct that feminism does pay attention to men in power, because there's a disproportionate number of men in power, if it were a rarer thing then I'd see your point. But we do see and have data backing the idea that white men have it easier than women and PoC. My question isn't incongruous with that. 

People opposed to or critical of feminism have a tendency to think that if young women are in power it's either because she's attractive or that some sort of affirmative action has gotten her there the idea that she got there because she worked for it is dismissed for sexist reasons, that same argument might then show a double standard assuming with evidence that any man in power already got there through hard work and determination. 

>I'm not supporting OP here, just disagreeing with you right comment. also kind of funny you talked about soundbite when your comment was literally the definition of whatboutism. just because you are correct about one thing (women getting harder time taken seriously), not everything you say about it will also be true. Just because you're fighting for feminism doesn't give you the right to say whatever that may act as ""your wrong"" and expect everyone to agree just because your opinion is favorable to women.

​I'm sorry but this doesn't make any sense. I can't even break it down, each sentence doesn't seem to connect with the previous one or the next. So I can't comment to it because I can't figure out what your point is. All I see are a few buzzwords like whataboutism and that somehow I think I'm right because I support women.

Meanwhile, for new hires they can sign off on anything that is within 10% of the current national average.  So you get newbies coming at much higher salaries, but the managers can not get approval to just do a blanket increase across the department.

The second article seems to be based on a decent dataset and good study practices though. Even though it doesn't conclude or even neccesarily imply women are often punished for negotiating. It does say that across their dataset women did seem to get what they asked for less often than men. With an interesting sidenote by the way:

""We did, however, find intriguing differences across age groups. The  younger women in the labor market appear statistically indistinguishable  — even in “getting” — from the younger men. Hence it could be that  negotiating behavior through the years has begun to change. Future  research may be able to decide whether true changes are going on in the  modern labor market.""

Alright fine.

Why would your employer recognize your work as praise worthy if you aren't the best worker?

The principle is the same. 

Nobody gets recognition for being 'adequate', exceptionalism is noted.

>Only the best companies get to demand the best applicants.

You misunderstand, when I said 'best applicant' I meant of the people applying. Rare would be the job opening that had no competition. When you apply you need to be the best candidate in that pool for you to be selected for the job.

>If you aren't the best company or one that strives to be the highest quality employer delivering the highest quality product, don't be hypocritical and demand a level of output that is out of synch.

You're kidding right?

The SOP for most places to churn replaceable employees through burnout by demanding more than a sane person can deliver and watching them try anyway because we all like to be able to buy food.

I worked at a dry cleaners and went through a ""management training program"", I was an assistant manager who had filled in in every store they had and trained many new hires. A manager quit and even my then manager was sure I would get the position, but alas they hired an outside person. I thought, okay she probably just has more experience/ is older than me. I was 27 at the time. 

She trained at another store for a month, all the while I was the fill-in manager, leaving my store to close out the other one daily. When she took over the store I still had to close out her store because she refused to work nights but didn't have an assistant manager. I learned that she was 24 and had never worked at a dry cleaners before, she basically had some experience as a manager and was hired through a headhunting company. It was also rumored she was a heavy drinker, and would come in late often or just not show. 

After 4 months I was asked by the owner if I could go there for a week and work with her because she ""wasn't getting it"". Older bitchier me today would have laughed in his face, but young naive me agreed. She didn't even have the concept of a bank deposit down and admitted she lied to the manager who trained her because she didn't want to appear to be under qualified, she clearly didn't think I mattered much. After 2 days she called in sick for the rest of the week, but showed up on Friday to get her check... and reeked of alcohol. Managers were salary, so she got paid even if she wasn't there. 

Finally I nicely told the owner she needed a lot more training than I could give in a week and mentioned she was ""sick"" for most of the week and it was a common problem per her employees.

You assume hiring managers are able to just set aside their bias and hire the best person for the job but there’s a significant amount of evidence that shows this is not true. Women/minorities/protected classes are perceived as less competent with no basis in fact. This has been shown in studies where two identical resumes are submitted with either a typical white male name, a feminine name, or an “ethnic” name. Guess who’s resume gets more callbacks? When orchestras started having blind auditions where conductors were given a number instead of a name for the auditioning player, female hires jumped to near parity. 

The fatal assumption is that we were living in a perfect meritocracy for all history until those pesky civil rights movements forced affirmative action on us and made everything terrible.

its illegal to pay someone differently for the same job title, and its double illegal to fire the said someone for raising that issue.

Wells Fargo refused to refund $2k to me form illegal transaction. fought with them for 3 months, lost countless hours and gas on truck. one night I did literal  4 line complaint to CFPB and I got a call from wells fargo 8 in the morning saying they will try to fix the issue. within 3 days, they refunded it.

Quick edit: Also, assuming the amazing person is willing to actually negotiate, you aren't going to be able to hire them for the same price as a rubbish person. So ultimately, negotiation is the way people that have skills allow themselves to be paid more than people that lack those skills. You can't just expect to get paid more without asking and demonstrating your value. Employers generally aren't just going to give you more money for no reason. This is also why job searching is important even of you have a good job.

You are also sidestepping the reasons why matermity leave and paternity leave are the way they are. It is because of sexist ideas in the first place. The only reason maternity leave exists is because of the civil rights movement creating protections for discrimination against women, which were rampant. It was impossible for pregnant women to keep their jobs, in a time where two-income households were becoming the norm.

And then of course when they do get their jobs, society tells them and their husbands, it is still the mans job to be the breadwinner, the woman does the laundry, dishes, picks the kids up from school, watches them, schedules all their appointments, ands irons her husbands shirts at the end of it all.

In that kind of enviroment, you are forced to take less hours, quit, get a part time job, and in 10 years maybe when you can start leaving the kids at home alone, you can start your career again 10 years behind your husband. And still fold his socks for him at the end of the day. And teach your daughter how to start folding the socks too. 

It's a great way to keep a woman from achieving her aspirations if you ask me. Oh, did you want to be a partner at a law firm, did you want to be a successful architect, did you want to start a public health foundation? A stock broker? A physicist? Sorry you need to put that on hold in your prime to take care of the kids.

Today we are making more progress, countries that aren't America are starting to give paternity leave, better maternity leave. More households are open to the idea of dad staying at home, or dad sharing the housework, mom making more money, dad taking the kids to soccer games, etc. 

But we are not even close to perfect. Plenty of young ambitious 23 year olds still face discrimination, in part because their superiors don't respect them, their intellect, their career ambition, and treat them like a ticking time bomb who will get knocked up any minute and abandon her career for her precious kids.",,,0,0,reddit4

ed4draa,t1_ed45eth,2019-01-03 02:05:00,TwoXChromosomes,"Algorithms search to optimize (maximize or minimize) an error or a variation of the error. The human defines what the error is.

A simple example of statistical discrimination is that on average younger drivers have more car accidents and a model that does not have access to better data, such as actual driving behavior data, will tend to say that younger drivers are riskier than older drivers amd hence that higher insurance premium is caused by statistical discrimination. It is when a group has certain characteristics. In the kindergarden example, assuming women perform better on average, the simple fact being a woman would help increase odds of being hired.

Now, going back to what the algorithm is and what it isn't. Say for example you want to hire based on predicted sales per employee and you have different data (gender, age, education, prior workplaces). Your algorithm will be trained to predict the amount of sales based on the available data. Perfect. Probably very little bias as sales can be measured objectively in dollar amounts.

Now let's talk about bias. Sales are very easy to measure so let's say a different company wants to hire people that are predicted to do great on year-end performance reviews and assume we have company A and company B. Company A has perfectly objective performance reviews (maybe they have the luck of relying on sales data). The data therefore has no bias, it is a good representation of reality. The algorithm will have no bias even though it may do statistical discrimination (not necessarily a bad thing). And actually, it is not impossible that the algorithm ends up hiring more men. Now imagine company B where the performance reviews are really subjective (basically how much the boss likes you) and it turns out the boss is a chauvinistic pig that hates women. The performance reviews will likely be biased downwards for women because of this. A model trained on this biased data will end up emulating the same behavior as the chauvinistic pig boss as it will ""learn"" that women are worse but it is just reproducing a different bias. It will end up hiring more men. In company A, getting more men is fair and based on predicted merit while in company B hiring more men will not be based on merit.

The key assumption is always how good the data used to create the model is.",iwonderx0,t2_uos2nnz,1,0,reddit4

Everyone has tried taking only really special people.  There are two problems with that.  First, in many cases a business urgently need someone qualified, and acceptable socially, and looking for someone exemplary when you have a qualified candidate is losing the business money from the work not being done or being done by people better used elsewhere.  

Second, every business that can afford to be picky and only hire really special people is already trying to do that.  A business is only in that position when the labor market is in shambles (which is not a good time to found a business- no customers), or the business is already successful. And yet there is wide variation in how businesses identify special people, and wide variation in how successful they are in that endeavor, and the business's financial success is not closely correlated to that metric, especially on quarterly time scales.

>Which better solution do you think of, that hasn't been yet explored?

If I knew the answer to that question, I'd open a consulting firm, staff it with method, and rake in the big bucks :p.

>What I'm trying to say is, if the number of people gets big enough nearly every method must have been tried.

And there are so many factors in business that mean that even if someone stumbled into the perfect hiring technique (and I don't think anyone has), and even if we assume that they also had a perfect training technique, then any of a number of other factors could tank the business before they become successful.  Likewise, a number of other factors can let a business compensate for bad hiring practices and still be successful.

>And off topic, in which way in the ""survival of the fittest"" a misconception of natural selection?

Maybe not a misconception, but an oversimplification. Natural selection is the concept that certain organisms are selected against by their environment, and they die before they reproduce, thus reducing the frequency of their genes from the species.  The positive version of that statement, that those that are best suited to their environment manage to survive and reproduce, ignores the fact that natural selection does not care about the difference between ""good enough"" and ""best"".  The catchy statement ""survival of the fittest"" implies ""only the best survive"".  An arguably better interpretation, is ""only the weakest die without reproducing"".  In the absence of strong selection pressures, evolution is so slow, because the current gene pool is good enough.

With strong selection pressures, survival of the fittest is a more sensible way of putting it, but that only happens rarely in nature. ",PandaLark,t2_dtck7,2,0,reddit4

That is a good point I will grant you that.

&#x200B;

As a general rule if anyone ever suggests that something is ""just the way things are"" then they'd better have the data to back that statement up and the whole idea should be taken with extreme skepticism. 

&#x200B;

Let's go back to the airline attendants again. How could we test to see if airline attendants as a job were being gendered in such a way? Well first we could see if the company was specifically gendering the position only asking for female applicants for the position, that would be wrong because it's putting the wagons in front of the train. If they aren't we could look to see if they have a bias in accepting female applicants over male applicants by comparing how many female applicants were being hired compared to male applicants since the staff is entirely female then we'd be able to identify the problem here again because the only way that would be possible is if no men ever applied. If that's not the case again the problem is that there is a deliberate gender bias being enforced which is not the correct way of doing things we can agree. But let's say no men are applying, then we are likely looking at a systemic issue where men are being discouraged from the job because the job is considered gender culturally and it's not a man's job to be a flight attendant again which is wrong.

My point is that if a given group of people are at an inherent advantage in a given field then we can expect that they'll be represented in that field to a greater extent. My other point though is that this should not result in a monoculture in that job because averages don't work like that. The average human has less than two hands, because some people have two and others have one and others have one hand with two fingers and another with five.

Am I making sense? Or am I missing the point somewhere? If I am, please, point it out.

The Tech industry is fortunately one where its easier for your work to speak for itself, which makes it only a bit but a significant bit harder for management to ignore your contributions.

You never need to feel ashamed or that you're bragging to simply state what you've achieved.

An author puts their name on a novel they've written, a painter signs their painting. What you accomplish in the workplace is as much yours as what those artists create.

Achievements are statements of facts, you're entitled to taking pride in your work , so regardless of if you're around people that live in their own delusional reality when you think that experience has or can further the goals of your workplace you should bring attention to them.",aka_mythos,t2_k7szj,4,0,reddit1

As a tenured software dev myself (male), I work on a team of 3 other male devs and one female dev. All members are treated equal, two of the males (myself and one other) are basically a step under senior and the rest (including the female) are all senior devs with nearly 20 years of experience each.  


Don't accept being treated ""lesser"" because of your gender OR position. When I first started (6 years ago) we had one male senior engineer (who wasn't a senior engineer IMO) that had a real problem with non developers and women in general. At that time, it was a full male dev team and this guy acted like devs were kings of the company. Most other roles like scrum master, product owners and help desk were mostly women. He was downright rude and ignorant towards them for both not being a dev and for being female. I called him out on it several times.... thankfully the guy got himself fired over 4 years ago. No call for that!",battleman13,t2_10cyej,2,0,reddit1

Know your own worth. It's something that a lot of employees, particularly women, in my experience, don't. These days, most people get promotions by moving sideways, i.e. by taking a job elsewhere that's a step up. It's actually *much* more impressive to have got a promotion where you already are, especially when they didn't need to promote you - i.e. you weren't filling a recently vacant role. In all likelihood, you're some pretty hot stuff (profession wise). Next time you go for a job somewhere and they offer you a salary, *ask for more*. It sounds like you're now senior enough that you're not easily replacable. If you've already convinced someone to hire you, that means they want *you* and if you ask for an extra 10k, they're likely to see it as worth it and they will likely respect you for it. 

As you get more senior, it's not money that becomes the limiting factor for recruitment, it's getting the right people. Also, as you move up the ladder, sexism comes into play less and less. The higher you go, the less people give a shit about your gender, age, sexuality, race or the colour of your skin, they just care about whether they think you can do the job well and make the business more succesful.",Spanky2k,t2_lodzt,2,0,reddit1

People think that a focus on gender rights and equality and regulation can force change, but historically it doesn't. Only when people see these kinds of events as normal will change truly occur.  So these posts matter most because slowly but surely women are being recognized because, like OP, their excellent at what they do.  And it certainly makes me happy to see.

When people see prejudice as the exception, and equality as the rule, then they will expect it, provide it, and foster it.

This post anecdotes a 100% female promotion rate and a 0% male promotion rate, and everyone is fine with it.

Had there been 40 women and 60 men, and only 1 woman and 6 men were promoted (2.5%% and 10% respectively), people would be pissed.

Obviously there a lot of nuance here, and the populations and samples are small, making any statistical analysis insignificant. But it's still a funny thought.

This anecdote either shows that:

- you can't judge a company by it's cover, because they treated their only woman well relative to the men

- there was no bias at this company for promotions

- there is a bias at this company that favors promoting women

- someone realized the only woman was getting paid below market and/or below her peers, and decided to correct that",thegtabmx,t2_ufdri,0,0,reddit1

I collected all my cookbooks and recipes in one place. Then,  I created a spreadsheet with these columns: 

* category (beef, chicken, fisth, vegetarian),
*  recipe name, 
* cookbook name,
* page, 
* each ingredient in each column

 I omitted basics like salt, chicken stock, garlic, oil, onions, milk, flour, etc.   

I ended up with about 300 recipes.  I then could sort by type, search by ingredient, etc.  I pinned the printout to my bulletin board. I asked fam to pick their favorites - what they were in the mood for.  I kept a copy on my phone so I could grab ingredients on the fly without a detailed list if I wanted to make say, spaghetti bolognese.  That way I don't forget the white wine or the scallions or whatever ingredient I'm always low on & forget :)

Crispy gf chicken nuggets/fingers:

Boneless chicken

Seasoned gf flour (I like Kentucky Kernel's)

GF panko (like kikkomen)

Milk or non-dairy milk substitute of your choice

One egg - (egg substitute works very well too)

Vegetable oil, for frying

Salt or salt substitute 

Tenderize chicken, then cut to desired nugget or finger size.

Double dredge chicken pieces in seasoned gf flour, dipping in milk (or substitute) between dredges. The second dredging will help hold the panko on. 

Add egg/substitute to the milk/substitute and whisk until blended. Dip in milk-egg mix and place in panko and shake until coated, remove with fork to keep panko from falling off. 

Heat fryer to 375 or oil in pan to medium and cook chicken until golden, 3-4 minutes for nuggets, 4-5 minutes for fingers. Salt to taste, enjoy!",Lucendienne,t2_327rc,68,0,reddit2

Got it! Based on your preferences, here's a sample meal plan for the week:

Day 1:
- Snacks at work: Assorted nuts, carrot sticks with hummus, and a piece of fruit.
- Dinner: Hearty Beef and Bean Chili with your choice of toppings such as shredded cheese, sour cream, and chopped green onions.

Day 2:
- Snacks at work: Greek yogurt with granola, mixed berries, and a drizzle of honey.
- Dinner: Baked chicken breast with roasted vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots) and a side of quinoa.

Day 3:
- Snacks at work: Hard-boiled eggs, sliced cucumber with tzatziki sauce, and a handful of grapes.
- Dinner: Vegetarian black bean chili topped with diced avocado, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime.

Day 4:
- Snacks at work: Peanut butter with apple slices, a handful of trail mix (nuts, dried fruits, and chocolate chips).
- Dinner: Grilled salmon with a side of steamed asparagus and wild rice.

Day 5:
- Snacks at work: Rice cakes with almond butter, cherry tomatoes, and a small portion of dark chocolate.
- Dinner: Turkey and vegetable stir-fry with a variety of colorful vegetables (bell peppers, snow peas, carrots, and broccoli) served over brown rice.

Remember to adjust portion sizes according to your appetite and dietary needs. Additionally, feel free to customize the dinner choices to your liking.

keb5pyw,t1_ke6v0il,2023-12-21 11:13:49,TwoXChromosomes,"Sure. I would previously just manage the list manually as a text file (low sophistication = low risk of crashing and corrupted files).

I usually prompt it something like:

>I'm going to give you my to-do list of tasks and I'd like you to help me managing them by adding and removing items when I tell you to. Please remove items entirely from the list (instead of crossing them out) when they're completed. After each prompt, please show me the entire updated list, and never truncate the list.

And instead of having just the description of the task as the entry, I usually use codenames so I can just say 'Neptune is finished' rather than 'I've paid the bill for the daycare' each time. And I also tell it to categorise it as Work, Writing or Personal tasks.

Here's an example of the next two items on my to-do list for today:

>Thursday, 21 December  
>  
>Ikarranggal (Work): \[NAME REMOVED\] needs to resubmit final email test.  
>  
>Paaliaq (Writing): Finish mapping \[NAME REMOVED\] to plot structure and look for homes for orphaned scenes.

And then I'll say:

>New Personal task before Ikarranggal, codename Builth: Send kids' Christmas book to OfficeWorks for printing

For medical reasons, my memory is like swiss cheese, so I've been finding doing this makes me that much less likely to forget important tasks, appointments and events.

I know there's Outlook or Google Calendar, but ... I like being able to converse with the to-do list casually.

(Note that after you've reached a few thousand tokens, it can get a little screwy, so I just copy my entire to-do list, start a new chat window, put that prompt in and paste the to-do list the previous conversation had been managing.)",DPVaughan,t2_b10qsvrn,2,0,reddit2

She then asked the bar tender/manager for help and he would not do a god damn thing. The guy turns to her (as the bar tender left to take orders) and said he's not gonna kick me out he's my buddy. It is frustrating knowing she was assaulted and the public at the bar did nothing to help her. I've never been to a bar where staff didn't take sexual assault seriously.

I was having a really crazy night at my bar last night as well, and towards the end a group of middle aged men came up and started calling me and my badass co-bartender “girls”. We asked them very firmly not to call us that, because it was demeaning and misogynistic, and got them their drinks. They persisted, moving on to sweetheart, and trying to make fun of my coworker for using the world “misogynist”—“So you don’t like ‘sweetheart’, but you sure like big words, huh?” She happens to be a PhD candidate who teaches feminist theory, so...kind of? As they were leaving I thought one was actually listening to me, he started to almost apologize and I, very calmly I thought, said something like, “Yeah man, I don’t like to be harsh, but that shit is very rude, if this doesn’t seem familiar please be clear with your male friends not to treat women like this.” I thought the interaction was becoming civil, but instead he angrily said, “Yeah you have a great night. If you keep acting like this, I hope you know that you’re gonna lose a ton of business.”

Back in the 90's, I used to play in arcades a lot. Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was a new release. Back then, a female gamer was uncommon. However, there were 2 young women that played fairly regularly and held their own with the boys.
  
One day we were all putting our quarters up on the machine and waiting our turns to play. When it was my turn, one of the girls had won her match so I was to be the next fatality. 
  
I'm reaching down to plug my quarters into the machine when one of the other guys smacks my hand and it hits her in the ass. I was mortified! So here he is laughing and she's giving me the death stare. She didn't see him so as far as she's concerned I just did a shitty thing to her and this other guy must be laughing because of it. 
  
I froze. All I could do was apologize to her and I glared back at the guy and told him not to do it again. I'm a slightly socially awkward guy and I don't do well with confrontation. Especially back then. It didn't help the guy was twice my size. 
  
I'm cringing right now and I'm feeling bad about it all over again. She didn't deserve that shit. She just wanted to play a damn game. I'm an ass for not handling the situation better. ",RaiderOfChests,t2_8o39svm,10,0,reddit3

We are all drinking and having a good time, when his girlfriend - who we had just met - said ""What the hell are you doing?  He just grabbed my ass!""  I was flabbergasted; I had done no such thing, and my girlfriend who was standing *right there* asked her what her problem was, that did *not* happen.  She insisted that it did and started yelling at my friend to do something about it.  He was puzzled at why I would grab her ass, and also, why would she lie about me grabbing her ass.  She wouldn't let it go, despite being a complete fabrication.    She insisted on leaving, and away they went.  Next time we met, I anticipated some awkwardness, but she acted like nothing happened, and she hasn't acted like a psycho since.  Weird, but relevant that sometimes people make shit up, or maybe actually perceive that something happened when it didn't.

Empathy in of itself is no more than attempting to understand the thoughts and feelings of another human. It is not condoning or approving. 

Have you ever watched a video or documentary on the upbringing of a serial killer? The fact they exist at all is evidence some people find it interesting. That kind content pushes those who watch it towards empathy to better understand how someone got to the point they could take the life of another. 

It's important that we understand these types of people. If we never attempted to understand the mind of someone prior to doing terrible things, we would never be able to stop others from committing those same terrible acts in the first place. ",redwall55,t2_braz7,-40,0,reddit3

1 - Because they wouldn't fucking turn up, imho. Maybe some LEOs can chime in.

And if they did, people would be yelling (rightfully, I think) about *”wasting police time better used for 'real crimes’ ”.*

2 - Even so, how would it play out?

Scenario A;
 - She tells the manager.
 - The manager calls the cops and then says *""while we're waiting, everyone get the fuck back to work and pretend as if nothing happened.""*
 - That doesn't seem fair to OP or other women the alleged ass-grabber might go for while we're waiting.

Scenario B;
 - She tells the manager.
 - The manager calls the cops and then says *”while we're waiting, in acknowledgement of people's feelings, and to stop further issues, I’m gonna seperate the two involved parties, you, get in the broom closet and you go sit where we stack the spare chairs. Btw I'm not paying either of you for the time lost.”*

And in both those scenarios would he assign security staff to keep an eye on things?

I mean, seriously, have you ever worked at or been in a place of business?


But … **BUT** ...

3 - Would you **then** be satisfied? If *that* scenario had been posted … Is there **no** chance you would now be saying *”why should they have believed her enough to call the cops”?*

Erm, I apologize it's 3 in the morning where I am so I'm a tad tired. I don't quite think I got my point across too clearly. I meant to refer to people PRIOR to horrible acts they commit. A serial killer is both born and made. Some people are predisposed to doing terrible things, but even those who lean towards doing bad things can be raised to know better. The same is true for the reverse.

What this guy did was messed up, absolutely. What I meant to say though is that there are others out there that aren't like him, but have the potential to be.

That is why it's dangerous to not believe a victim and to treat them like some snake that just wants to get someone into trouble for NO personal profit.

That's ridiculous.

It certainly would be preferable for the behavior in question, because the law isn't going to come down particularly hard on someone for an ass grab.

If we want this kind of behavior to stop, then what happened in this case is exactly what needs to happen. The law can't police every touch.

Your concern about who to believe is valid, but seems misplaced in this case, for reasons others have explained to you. Your attitude to these things of always requiring positive proof actually works in favor of the perpetrators of harassment, who learn they can get away with things by denial. The context needs to be taken into account, and it sounds as though in this case, it was.

I ask because I know that Texas has a thing where they can arrest you for this, especially since your parents have the proof from the clinic you elected to terminate a pregnancy. That clinic is in danger too, your parents could theoretically have them charged for what they did according to how the laws work in Texas these days think. I know they arrested a woman for self-abortion who was only just released a few days ago, so please keep yourself safe and be aware of what your parents could do to you if they feel like punishing you further. Get that letter back and get out of Texas if you can, for your own safety. Housing could become not an issue for you if they decide to call you a murderer and arrest you to try you for what the state sees as a crime. 

I'm so sorry they did this to you out of narrow minded idiotic religious zealotry. If God existed I cannot imagine they would be okay with the way your parents have treated you, because I'm fairly certain Jesus was all about saving women in rough situations- the whole ""he who is without sin cast the first stone"" thing. I hope they get exactly what they deserve for doing this to you, a life of shame and regret and isolation from their church and friends for being the kind of people who would kick out their own child rather than have any kind of compassion.

But you can file a complaint with the Inspector General of the post office and see if it goes anywhere. If it had your name on it, a HIPAA complaint against the clinic might not go anywhere, but you could try that too.

Did you go to a state that doesn't require parental consent or notice? Or did you get a judicial bypass? If you got a bypass, reach out to whoever helped you with it. If not, reach out to Jane's Due Process. They likely have experience with this and may have resources they can refer you to. 

Make sure that you get your important documents and any money that you have saved. You don't want people like this hanging onto a Social Security card or anything. You can withdraw your money from your bank account and open a new account at a different bank so your parents can't access your money. 

If you're going to college, call your college's financial aid office and see what you have to do to get your parents removed from your FAFSA. That way you can get aid based on your income alone. 

Thats all that I can think of off the top of my head. Good luck, I know it's difficult and I'm sorry this happened.

Is there not a friend who will let you stay at their house for the last 2 months of school? In my senior year, my friends mom got evicted and had to move to Manor to live with /her/ friend there. I (with the support of my parents, I admit) let my friend live with me in my bedroom for the last year so she wouldn’t have to change schools and have everything upended. I would imagine an even shorter time wouldn’t be unreasonable to at least finish school. (But, I won’t pretend to know all the details surrounding your situation.)

I don’t know what you’re looking for when it comes to college, but Starbucks offers a full ride to ASU (online courses) when working a minimum of 20 hours a week. It’s not something I’ve personally looked into yet, but many of my coworkers are currently taking classes and/or about to graduate themselves. (My sister also finally graduated college through them last year, and she had just turned 35.) They also reformed the way they do it recently, so it’s no longer a reimbursement set up, they literally pay for everything, even if you drop classes, so there is no upfront cost like there used to be. 

Regardless, you have a support network here in this subreddit, and you are more than welcome to reach out if you need anything in the austin area. I hope that everything works out well for you despite the bull that your family is putting you through.",ProbablyRaptor,t2_qqj3g,2,0,reddit4

Perhaps look for colleges that are far away and take out extra loans to help pay for the first few months until you are established. Look for community colleges if you are afraid you won't graduate.

He didn't leave us for 6 weeks, until he left to go to Uni and moved in to a flat with a bunch of friends. But I just can't to this day fathom how a parent can just abandon their child because of something that doesn't hurt anyone else.

i4fttte,t1_i4fdado,2022-04-12 15:30:30,TwoXChromosomes,"i strongly urge you to talk to a guidance counselor at your current school.  there are programs in some places for helping homeless students stay in their schools.  they may be able to help you find a place to live until you graduate.  also, be sure to get copes of important documents from you family - such as birth certificate, social security card, vaccination records.  you will need those to apply for housing and education assistance.  the good news is that if your parents have abandoned you, you will be eligible for financial aid for college based on your (not your parents) income, making it much more likely you will receive maximum assistance.  If you already filled out a FAFSA for college financial aid and you entered your parents income, you should amend it to show that your parents are not supporting you and wont help you with college costs.  If you have not completed a FAFSA yet, do so immediately - ask the guidance counselor to help you with that as well.  Do the FAFSA even if you arent sure if you will go to college or where you will go next year.  You dont have to accept the financial aid if you decide to postpone college for a year or two.  You can re-apply every year.

also, you might think about suing the clinic that exposed your health history - its a HIPAA (health care privacy law) violation.  talk to a lawyer.

i am sorry the health care clinic and your parents have treated you so badly at such an important time in your life.  you should be celebrating your graduation and looking forward to college.  its not the end of the world if you end up postponing college.  i didnt get serious about college until i was 21 but then i went on to earn four degrees over the next 13 years.  and i worked and supported myself the whole way through.  i was also abandoned by my parents - when i was 16.  i lived with my older brother to finish high school, then moved in with friends.  look for the black sheep in the family - the one who doesnt go to the same church as your parents - is there someone like that who might let you live with them at least for a few months until you finish high school? or maybe a friend's family?

I was gone for about 2 to 3 weeks until finally he made the threat to sell my guitar, amp, basically the only stuff I couldn't take with me, if I didn't return.

If she had a meeting with them and told them she wanted to record it so she could remember the lessons, she might even get them to admit it on video.

Finish high school, don't get a ged if you can avoid it. If you're sociable and likeable, apply for receptionist jobs. They are plenty of part time positions and they pay well. This will help with you finishing school.

One thing I really wish I had known when I got kicked out was the sheer number of international language programs that don't require you to know a second language. South Korea and Japan are especially popular, but Germany and France have similar working student programs. This will give you a chance to live, work, and learn in a fun and interesting way. You will get a lot of life experience and come back with an impressive resume.

Edit: It looks like it might help, with documentation. [This post](https://www.quora.com/If-you-are-disowned-by-your-family-before-college-at-age-18-how-would-you-fill-out-the-financial-aid-form) is by a ""College Financial Aid Expert"":

Q: If you are disowned by your family before college at age 18, how would you fill out the financial aid form?

A: If you are an unaccompanied youth who is homeless or self-supporting and at risk of homelessness, you may qualify as an independent student.

Otherwise, contact the financial aid administrators at the colleges to which you’re applying and ask for a dependency override. **They will want to see independent third-party documentation of your situation**, such as letters from teachers, school counselors, social workers, clergy, police, courts, child advocates, etc., who are family with your situation.",NearlyFreeFall,t2_k2p4b4nk,5,0,reddit4

i4gongs,t1_i4ffp37,2022-04-12 18:42:06,TwoXChromosomes,"I was kicked out at 18, and didn’t talk to any of my family for 4 years. Honestly, the Pell Grant and other possible grants kept me afloat. They helped so much, but I barely stayed afloat the whole time. Once you do the FAFSA with your own income, you should be able to get the maximum for the Pell Grant as long as you personally make less than ~$20,000/year. The max Pell is about $6,000 right now if I remember correctly. That’s split between two semesters though- so it would be $3,000 in the fall and $3,000 in the spring. It doesn’t sound like a lot, but it really made a difference. If you decide to go to college, it will be a struggle for a bit, because your life is turned upside down and you’ve been through some traumatic experiences, but it isn’t impossible, apply for as many grants as you can and take out student loans, they do have an option where you can take out a little extra to use for books or just in general if you need to but try to avoid this if you can- but go to a community college like others have suggested. It may save you significant amounts of stress down the line and can be tens of thousands cheaper for your undergrad. Community colleges tend to be more understanding of difficult situations too, and more relaxed in my experience- it’ll be much easier to slide into the experience than jumping into a 4 year, and student and staff differences between community and a 4 year are significant. 

If you decide to wait, take the time to work on healing, and know that this isn’t an end to everything you have planned with your life, it’s just an obstacle to get through. 


I’m sure others have mentioned it too, but Heath insurance- you should be covered by their insurance into your 20s, even if they’ve kicked you out. If you know what insurance they go through or have your own insurance card make sure you keep that with you.",KayTeddy1,t2_12xfr5,3,0,reddit4

If she reports this to a counselor, even without the precipitating reason, she's talking abuse or neglect, and that is a mandated report to social services. If it goes that way, OP's privacy will not be protected. Her parents might disclose to CPS that OP had an abortion, opening OP to the kind of liability she's trying to avoid with the new law. Who knows what the theoretical legal limits are with this appalling fucking law? Could a social worker initiate one of those reports just to be a dick and try to collect money? It's unethical, but so is the law itself.

On the other hand, a counselor can get the parents in and inform them that what they're doing is potentially criminal, but the possible fallout is enormous. If OP goes to a guidance counselor, she needs to know that saying certain things will trigger a report, so if she wants to talk around it (""my friend has this situation"") they may indulge that for the purposes of giving information, but realistically if they think this applies to her, they're going to try to handle it and it might not work out like OP needs it to. The bounty hunting law is super nebulous. Do we know if it applies here?

OP, if you're reading this, my heart breaks for you. I urge you to consider where your red lines are, who your supports are, and a short/medium/long term plan of action.

just like my country's poor people made the choice to have 6 to 14 kids and then blame the government for their own ""misfortune"" for being so poor, having that many kids kind of makes it impossible to have any financial growth. and then those kids grow up to be sex workers or sold to human trafficking rings or to foreigners

Most politicians don't want to admit that there's a difference between ""human trafficking"" in the sense of women literally kidnapped and forced against their will into sex work (which happens, but less often than people think) and the sense of women immigrating without proper authorization and working willingly in sex work because it's the best option for supporting themselves (which is far more common than politicians admit).

Of course there's a spectrum between those points, but it tends to all be generalized into a ""every sex worker is a victim of human trafficking"" narrative, while cracking down and deporting people who would rather not be deported.

However, such a line of argumentation overlooks potential benefits that the legalization of prostitution might have on those employed in the industry.

The issue I'm discussing is the idea of the fallacy of 'an appeal to authority'. It's morally right/wrong because it's illegal/legal.

A person speeds at 100 mph in a school zone. It's illegal. You find out they are rushing someone to a hospital because the person is dying at that very moment and they can't wait for an ambulance. Is it ethical?

The true measure of ethical/unethical is the questions of:

* Does it violate anyone's natural rights?

Saying that laws justify(or frame in your case) right or wrongness ignores that laws have justified many MANY wrong actions over the course of history and simply saying that 'because the law says so' is not only false, but it puts you into a line of thinking that justifies wrong actions simply because the law allows it to occur.

EDIT: sorry forgot something. Justices determine if it's legally right/wrong. Public opinion determines the ethics of the viewer.

Had a dude really talk up his chili and wouldn't let anyone else bring in chili to a potluck because his was sooooo good.  One lady really wanted to bring in her chili because it was a hit everytime she did, but decided not to because of him.  I also didn't bring mine in because of him, despite the fact that my family recipe had won contests for decades and even in the last few years.

He brought in his chili for a potluck and I swear it was the worst chili I ever had (multiple people concurred).  I had never tasted a chili so bland, and I had lived off of canned chili's for years as a poor person.  I legitimately couldn't have made a dish so bad if I had only used canned chili's.  His dish was mostly untouched by the end of the night.

Had another guy talk up his tamales.  They were also the worst tamales I ever had.  Barely any filling, the driest masa I ever tasted, zero flavor, etc.  I also know how to make tamales, and his were also barely eaten.

But depending on the type of gathering it is, it can be a bit harsh to judge somebody else on what they bring. Like let's say if it's a work required social gathering, there are just gonna be some employees that have the money, time, or joy of cooking and are gonna kick everyone's butts, where as some people are relieved if they can find the time or scrap the funds together to pick up something from the store for it. The best way I can think to compare it is like being the top athlete in gym class and getting annoyed with the kids who aren't as physically inclined for lessening the experience of the game. 

I personally live in a dry cabin with 1 cabinet, a microwave, and no access to water for dishes. I try to make up for it when I can by buying donuts here or there for the office when I have the funds, but for company potlucks or even family gatherings, I'm getting the store bought stuff. But I always tell everyone who took the time to cook something special that I appreciate it, and I make the effort to be on clean up crew to help contribute more. And if they are tired and opt to bring store bought stuff, I'm perfectly happy with that, like I don't feel entitled that they need to cook for me.

However what I think far too many people fail to understand is that the division of housework really is the canary down the mineshaft in terms of how your partner sees you and your time.

If he sits on his arse, refuses to participate in the daily duties involved with running a household, if he can't do it/won't do it for ""reasons"" then essentially he is telling his partner ""my time is more important than yours and I am happy for you to waste the precious years of your life being ground down and exhausted while I enjoy my free time as I see fit""

&#x200B;

Think about that for a minute.

Your time is of no consequence to him.

We all had chores to do. Mom let us know that we will learn after ourselves, foremost, and everyone must carry their weight. We rotated chore assignments and you could never clean the kitchen well enough so we hated that one. Dad cleaned, mom cleaned but we were more like the cleaning staff and they were the supervisors.

Teamwork reduces tiredness, exhaustion, and burnout. Also if both partners did chores, they would be finished faster, and you would have extra time for other things.

Yah I’m not naturally as strong as a lot of men, but I’m actually much stronger than the majority of men I meet, some of it is genetics, some of it is training. Sure Olympic power lifting records are higher for men than women. Big deal, I don’t know too many men lifting 1,000 lbs and I guarantee these internet trolls aren’t. Men generally have genetic features that make certain things easier for them  to be good at and yet I physically out perform men in most areas and I work in physically competitive job where speed, strength, endurance, and coordination are tested regularly. It’s not as easy for me to put on muscle as fast as them but because I’m dedicated and consistent, that doesn’t seem to matter much. 

Also anecdotally, most women I know take better care of themselves and are in better general physical condition than the men I know. Like cool bro, you look big, that will come in handy next time you need to curl an object 100lbs over and over, too bad you can’t even bend over properly to touch your toes. Meanwhile in the other corner of the gym, some 5’ nothing little pixie elf of a woman can run a 5:40 mile and plank for 5 min. Her physical capabilities have way more functional application than his and she is in much better health from a longevity and quality of life standpoint. Speaking of lifespans, women on average live much longer than men so yah know, there’s that.

Men have some really cool aspects to their bodies that can make certain activities easier to be better at, yet none of them have the capability to grow a human inside of them. The physical differences women poses are designed to literally support another life. These specialty functions are present to some degree in all biologically female humans. Not having kids out of choice and/or ability doesn’t change the fact that our bodies have really amazing design features that are responsible for the existence of our species. These are highly specialized adaptations that are responsible for all of us being alive today. How is that not an awesome and insanely powerful group of physical features? Our bodies are designed to sacrifice physical strength for the possibility of safely housing and growing a human. Like, there is a shit ton of energy and specially designed functions that goes into that. My body doesn’t just spray a little microbe like zygote somewhere and call the reproduction process done. I have super powers like being able to double my blood volume in the span of a just a couple months, I have fat stores to cushion and protect a fetus and feed it and myself should I become pregnant, I have a hip structure that might be less adapted at extreme heavy lifting and running but are capable of allowing a human to pass through, I mean the list goes on and on. Whose to say what features in a human are superior to others. It’s as stupid as saying light skin or dark skinned humans are better. Like no, one group of people developed skin to absorb more vitamin D in environments with little sunlight while another group of people developed darker skin to protect them from an abundance of sunlight. There’s no better or worse in all of biology. There are just organisms adapted for their specific niche.",So_Code_4,t2_17jzehod,3,0,reddit3

Also noting the study found a correlation but did not establish causality.  On that note, research is finding that people are just having less sex generally than 50 years ago, not just because of housework.

Second, reading this makes me frustrated I never received the same recognition while busting my ass off as the only dude in an all female company. Please don't dismiss me as bitter and angry. I just want a discussion.

I pulled multiple memorable all-nighters, gave computer related favors regularly, stayed in constant contact with my bosses to make sure every little detail was to their liking, stayed late 3/5 days a week on average to fix those last-minute nitpicky details and even spent a few weekends helping out with my boss's startup Yoga magazine. The ladies would go out to lunch together without ever inviting me, often leaving me as the only person left in a silent office. I was never included in any office humor or anything else that would have made me feel human rather than just my boss's tool. I'm quiet, but I'd at least say hello in passing and try and take an interest in each of their personal lives.

I worked up the courage to talk to my boss about how I felt once, but nothing seemed to really change.

I think if I used the phrase ""vag city"" or something similar to describe my all-female work environment, lots of subscribers to this subreddit would be upset or even offended. I definitely would have been fired. Is it fair for me to say I found ""Sausage Central"" a little sexist?

I also think that your success and my failure (or being unrecognized) has nothing to do with gender, but simply good and bad people that make up our work environment. Not to mention our seemingly different personalities.

I eventually quit after 2 years and found another job, but I wonder what I could have done differently to improve my relationship with my coworkers.

Regardless, I'm happy you've surrounded yourself with a great group of people that recognize you for work you can be proud of. I need to do more to find a group that empowers me to do more rather than leave me feeling exhausted and unimportant most days.",,,7,0,reddit4

However, I think I'm in a unique position because I am the first in-house designer they've ever had, which means that anything I do, no matter how much work I put in, is met with just-short-of-awe. The bar was set really low before I got there, haha. And while I say that my industry is male-centric, my company itself is... on the better side. We have and have had some astoundingly powerful women players in our midst. So in my case, I don't think it's my being a woman that's getting me recognition. It's our company actually having someone in house getting stuff done for them that they've never had done for them before.

That said, my post was saying that I'm happy I'm being recognized for my good work, because my industry is so male-dominated, and I was warned to expect rampant sexism. I didn't experience that rampant sexism, and I was recognized for my work. It's a nice situation to be in.

>You've come to talk with your female peers, and in an attempt to be funny and bond with them, you're putting men down.

It's a valid point. No one has to agree with it (I sure like using language insensitively, myself and I like to defend my ""right"" to do so even if I technically can't), that it doesn't make it any less valid of consideration.

Some real feeling people genuinely do consider this an insult. If we want to pretend to a civilised society then we should probably give a shit how we make other people feel regardless of how removed they are from ourselves, learn and move on a wiser person. Even if it feels ugly to confront it in ourselves. 

Or we don't, and we can insist everyone grow a thicker skin because ours is. Takes all kinds of assholes to make a world, and it's perfectly abhorrent in some way or another to pretty much everybody - the only equality I think I've ever seen in the world and now that I'm thinking about it - that's kind of beautiful. 

To the right of the point - I didn't actually think it was very funny. I didn't go so far as to consider it insulting, but it just wasn't funny either.

If we are to go back and look at how each word was originally defined we wouldn't be having this conversion.

There are two correct albeit contradictory uses of it and personally I think that's beautiful. It's like the word ""Bolted"" can me fixed or to flee. It's a wonderful language.

I agree that any one should be able to see what is posted here and men should be encouraged to see things from a woman's perspective. I just don't think that men really need to chime in when someone wants to go to a place **for women** and say, ""Hey other women! Here is a thing that happened to me and it's significant because I'm a woman and made me feel a way that is unique to this type of situation because I'm a woman"". It feels like butting into someone else's conversation.

If my wife went up to a group of her girlfriends and started talking about periods or something I really cannot relate to, I wouldn't feel the need to jump in and make some male analogy. No, she is taking to a sympathetic audience and I have no business chiming in with my two cents even if she knows I'm listening.

And        

""I literally have spent all my money, I just have $100 left.""

Apart from that..

First we were taught (and shown pictures) about STIs, if they are curable, what the symptoms are so you can recognise them on you and on someone else and go straight to the doctor if you start to show them. They taught us that some STIs can leave you infertile, can kill you, stay with you for life and all the different outcomes. They taught us about oral sex and about how you can catch things without anything else and about gay sex, saying if you are not protected you are just as likely to catch things (if not more) too. 

THEN they brought in fake teaching penises and taught us how to put a condom onto a penis. They told us that condoms are not 100% effective against STIs but if used right are pretty good against pregnancy. 

Then they taught us about all the different other types of contraceptive, the percentage failure and if there are any side effects to them. They taught us that any contraceptive that is taken by the female does not protect you against STIs. 

They then held a budgeting class, making us all pick a career path out of a hat and a wage and told to make it last, (paying a list of rent, utilities, etc) for 6 months. They then told you to add on thousands of £s, stretch it further, as you've had a baby and you need to pay for it. It basically made you see that it is incredibly difficult to raise and pay for a baby by yourself if you do not have any help especially if you are not in a financially stable way. 

Although they did tell us that the best way to avoid STIs and getting pregnant is to not have sex, they assumed we would all be doing it anyway so just wanted to educate us about it. They even gave out free condoms in the school office. ",exploringbear,t2_yanof,5,0,reddit1

  He convinced me to give up my virginity because we were going to get married anyway, and he was about to leave for his first tour in Iraq, and if he died, I would never be able to experience sex and I would be alone for the rest of my life and die an old maid.  Every time we had sex, I didn't want to, but I knew that my desires didn't matter because I was the woman.  It was the price I had to pay for companionship/children/etc.

I could understand that view back in the day when the material and discourse was being run almost entirely by men. But this was made in 2012 so surely there were a few women involved in making this.

Do those women really not get turned on when they kiss their partner? Are there really women who can read that women are basically asexual and completely emotionally motivated and be like ""yup- sounds about right""? 

There were adult women who knew damn well they've been turned on before and have been the sexual aggressor in certain situation ( with their husbands who is the ONLY man they've ever been with. Obviously). They knew for a fact what they were saying is a lie. And instead of having an actually productive conversation about BOTH genders controlling their desires, they just decided to keep up the lie and shame and confuse young girls who think there must be something wrong with them for *gasp* being aroused when they hook up with their boyfriend. (Obviously any girl within this community who has a girlfriend is already deep in the rabbit hole of shame and confusion regarding her sexuality

I can understand straight religious people not ""getting"" homosexuality or 
safe sex because they probably have as much knowledge on the topics as the kids they're supposed to be teaching. But you have a pussy and you know damn well that's not how they work.

I mean, there's only like a million things wrong with that flyer but that stood out to me as well. What does that teach boys? That they are animals with only one thing in mind? That they can only control their urges by never getting aroused? That girls are so sexual you can't kiss your girlfriend for too long out of fear you might feel something?

Oh and also. Masturbation is the ultimate act of selfishness? Really? Right. Because you have no say in what you are allowed to do with your own body. Apparently your body is not your own, it's God's or something.

We talked about the comparative risks of different kinds of sexual activity, and how to reduce the risks. I can remember lessons and tests on detailed reproductive anatomy (both male and female). 

But the thing that I only really realized later was that the teacher also gave us some pretty obvious hints about how to enjoy sex, too.

Anyways, I became a born again in college for a year 30 years ago... The pressure about sex was incredible. I was a virgin and never had a GF. I would routinely get asked if I was had masturbated at all. If you wanted to date a sister (sister in Christ) you had to at least have a double date if not a group date, so everyone could police every one. 

It was a paranoia. I had a bet with this black girl from Texas who thought the Rockets would take down the Celtics in the '86 finals. I took the bet. Whoever won would take the other out for coffee or dinner. We set a date. A couple hours before we were to meet. She called and said some of the elder sisters (older in Christ, not necessarily age) told here it could lead to temptation. She said she was sorry and I said I was too. 

The next day I got a talking to from one of my elder brothers. He was a bit more mellow in his explanation. But it amounted to the same. 

The thing was it was a platonic friendship. She was a lovely girl, but I was not attracted to her in that way. She was just this awesome girl.

Or told that it was wrong. They just advised me to be wise and to only do something that I felt comfortable doing, and that if I ever felt pressured in any way, to trust my instinct and get out of the situation.

Well thanks for telling me that french kissing doesn't turn me on when I myself know that I can get horny as fuck just from looking at my SO. And thanks for not actually clearing up questions that curious kids just have about how to do it and how to do it safely - that just makes them more fucked in the head, it makes them go to things like porn for information and it won't help them with safe sex either. Even the most chaste person should know on their wedding night what to do and most kids will make it to 17 before deciding that you've been feeding them a bunch of bullshit and they're going to have sex because it feels good, it satisfies curiosity, it's part of growing up for many people and it doesn't make you a bad person. Also, saying homosexual relationships aren't real because the bodies don't even fit- I guess you haven't heard of either anal or the immaculate fit that any person's head has between any other person's legs. 
My sex ed was pretty sound anatomy - wise but they didn't teach us enough about birth control and made kids feel like it was a weird thing to do when in reality, a few years later everyone had lost their virginity. 

And you know what happened when I lost my precious, more valuable than jewels virginity? Nothing, because it's not an object to be lost. It wasn't great, but a few years afterwards now I can say that I gained experience and tons of fun in exchange for a concept that does not matter a bit if you don't want it to.

(how sad is that?)

Orthodox churchgoers won't even talk about sex with their kids because it's impure and disgusting to them. this is how i was raised. my foster mother (a catholic nun) was so afraid of sex that she refused to talk about it, refused to teach the kids in her care about it, and worse, was so afraid of sex that she couldn't even talk about it when she found out the children under her care were being raped by priests. This is how orthodox religious communities treat sex: rape victims are guilty of sex before marriage and thus as permanently sullied. Girls who are victims of childhood rape are no longer marriage material, parents in orthodox religious communities shun child rape victims. And of course, married women cannot be raped and beating them is permitted, per the Bible.

As you can imagine, I DESPISE orthodox religion. I think it should be banned in the western world, almost ALL children in orthodox religious communities are victims of abuse in one way or another, and government refuses to do anything because orthodox religious groups are volatile and difficult to address without being accused of religious intolerance.

There are mohuls in orthodox Jewish communities that have KILLED baby boys by performing circumcisions (and using their mouths to ""cleanse"" the wound, it's so fucking disgusting I can't believe the authorities tolerate this in America....).

But hey, being accused of religious intolerance is waaaaay worse than saving innocent children, obviously. /s

Big Love is a tv show that exposes the dark side of Mormonism, but children are treated this way in orthodox Christian, Jewish and Muslim communities too. excellent show. cannot recommend it enough to people who don't understand how abusive orthodox religious groups in America really are.

They never quite explain to you how you are going to find this great Prince Charming to love you and marry you if all every guy cares about is sex.

Fast forward to nowadays, he is seeing a sexologist because his masturbation habits ruin their sex life. (Oh, I really hope my friend doesn't read Reddit.)

Living life responsibly involves learning control, and Heaven Forbid kids learn anything like self control these days!  It's far easier to couch it in vague notions like ""do it only if you're married"", without giving a good, solid reason that makes sense to a teen who has hormones charging through his or her bloodstream like a freight train.

Girls are capable of liking sex as much as boys do, it's just we aren't as hormone soaked as boys.  Trust me, one good long menstrual period is great for cooling your heels about the jolly business of ""old enough to get pregnant"", and girls usually have a year or two experience with that before they consider the possibility of having sex, while boys, not having the speed bumps of a menstrual period, can't get why women would be stingy with something the guys want so badly.  The fundamental issue regarding guys is that they simply have no way nor any desire to throttle down and get control of the all-consuming male desire to have sex.  Telling them that sex makes babies will get you ""Not my problem, man, I'm not even twenty yet"" or telling them that sex should be reserved for marriage will get you an incredulous ""are you crazy!  If I have to wait that long, my hormones will eat me alive!""

Meanwhile, the aforesaid adult writes his brochure acknowledging the ardor boys will feel while pursuing sex, and yet write words for each of the documents as though he is speaking to girls only, talking of reserve, valuing oneself, and one's social reputation.  Words meant not to inform but to instill FEAR.

And this is where the parents have to shoulder their responsibility to be candid, forthright, and firm regarding how sex occurs and the responsibility their children will incur while exploring those feelings.  It isn't a teacher's job to guide children through this singular time of their lives.  It's the parent's responsibility to be honest and to demystify the subject.  We've always touted that knowledge is power, and that includes the ability to protect ourselves.  By refusing to take responsibility for informing their children, they are shoving their kids blind and deaf into a world that is no longer kind to the innocent nor tolerant of the ignorant.

I remember when I was a teen; things were nowhere near as complex as all this.  We knew about getting pregnant, and we knew about preventing it, and we largely downplayed STDs and the consequences thereof, but outside of gonorrhea and syphilis, we didn't feel a lot of fear about relationships.  But now, things are a whole lot different.  AIDS reared its ugly head, and lifestyle choices brought death to lots of people from those times.  Those of us who can now look back on those times.  We were lucky, or we were informed about what could happen, so we protected ourselves.

The idiocy of it all is that there are still self-deluding people out there who could easily have been the author of these brochures.  My husband's Aunt C, when asked to watch a short video about science research once said:  ""Why do we need to know all this?  Everything we need to know is in the Bible!"" She just didn't get it.  Times change, mankind changes, lifestyles change, everything changes eventually, so sticking to one lifestyle is the same as putting the brakes on evolving.  It doesn't work, because the environment around you keeps changing, and you have to change too, adapting to new dangers, and new rules.  The smart survivors are the ones that know, understand, and respect what life can throw at you both positive and negative, and brochures like these are trying to inform without actually doing so, and they also seek to perpetuate the culture of fear that have kept women from making dangerous choices. Thanks for reading, if you did.

But, If I am wearing a gay pride shirt, a mini skirt, eye liner and carrying a purse -- it WILL be a lot harder to convince others I'm actually not gay. Clothing does send out messages. To say it does not is bullshit. However, as a straight man, if I left my house wearing said gay pride shirt, skirt, make up and a purse -- I couldn't get furious if a few gay guys hit on me. But , and this is important, if one gay guy pulled me off the street and started ass fucking me in an alley against my will -- I didn't ask for it, and it is most definitely rape. You're date is JUSTIFIED in his confusion if you wear nipple tassels with your ass hanging out your skirt/shorts  as to why you don't want to have sex,
Granted you are allowing strangers to see most of the goods ?? But, if he starts ass pounding you against your will -- it is still a brutal crime. 

And to some extent you are responsible for your attires affect on others, and you put yourself at a greater danger. For instance: If I wore a shirt that said fuck n**gers. And a black guy beats the fuck out of me ... Yes, it is a crime for him -- he will go to jail. But, My clothing choice put me in danger. Another example. If I am a female prison guard, it is my RIGHT to show cleavage. But, if you walk around the prison yard with your tits hanging out, you are putting yourself in greater danger! Yes, it is the inmates fault if they touch you -- no you did not ""ask for it"", but you DID stupidly choose your attire for the occasion and placed own self in danger. ",,,-5,0,reddit1

> 2 - When it comes to saying ""no"" in a dating relationship, your words, your body and your clothes all must be saying it

Consent or lack thereof must be stated clearly. Where's the problem in that?

>  3 - What if I never marry? [...] Your life choice should be the one that best meets your goals and aspirations.

Sounds pretty lax as far as religious preaching tends to go. It says marriage is nice, but if you don't want to marry, it's fine too!

>  4 - If you truly love someone, you will respect his or her desire to save sex for marriage and will lovingly choose to embrace those values [...] sadly too many young people fall victim to sexual pressure because of the fear of being rejected.

Makes sense. You decide whether or not you want sex, so don't give in to peer pressure or shaming tactics because you risk being taken advantage of. Holy fuck, this is unreasonable to you?

>  5 - It is never too late! If you have already given away the gift of your virginity, then reclaim it today! You can start saving yourself for marriage again!

In other words, don't worry too much if you've made bad decisions in the past, it's never too late to be more selective about whom you sleep with if you aim to get married. Once again, where's the problem?

>  7 - You better believe it! [...] risky sexual behavior, such as oral sex, can transmit life-threatening and incurable diseases such as HIV, HPV, genital herpes, chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea

All the STDs listed there are confirmed to transmit via oral sex. 

>  9 - Pornography is wrong because it teaches a man to value a woman to value a woman based upon how much she physically stimulates him. It trains men to treat women as sexual objects to be discarded once they are done using them for their own selfish pleasure.

You have a problem with this? It's textbook feminism. You probably wouldn't want your relationship prospect to be a guy who likes porn where women are treated like dogshit. I've never seen many happy marriages in which the husband is a porn afficionado. I'm sure there are plenty, but looking through /r/relationships it looks like avid porn consumption in men can definitely be a problem. Again, you find this to be an unreasonable line of thought? 

>  10 - masturbation is bad blablabla i'm tired of writing 

Sounds silly, but it's the same as 9. because dudes almost always masturbate with the aid of pornography
 
6. and 8. are silly. Point 6 overstates the failure rate of condoms by a lot, and 8 is good old fashioned religious gay bashing. Other than these, though, the whole thing honestly seems pretty reasonable, actually one of the more level-headed religious propaganda pamphlets I've ever seen. The second flier is also hilariously badly written, but it nevertheless manages to crank out a reasonable line of thought: that sex shouldn't be a relationship cornerstone, which it easily can be if you let shitty men have their way

WOW OP, such a HORRIFIC flier, oh-em-eff-gee, are you one of those 2cool4school 16 year olds who thinks sex-ed is boring, or are you a seasoned veteran who knows from experience that having a lot of promiscuous sex is fine and safe, and leads to an emotionally fulfilling long term relationship?

At least in my experience, although plenty of women want and enjoy sex, men tend to be more up for random, NSA sex and are generally more commitment-phobic, at least in their early 20s--hence the tropes of the player, fuckboy, etc.

I wonder if that's because, as I've read expressed on reddit, it's harder for women to get off (again, *generally,* not 100%), especially if they don't have a well-established relationship with their sex partner, don't feel safe and secure, and if the partner isn't putting much effort to give them pleasure (ie a ONS)? That or women have more to ""risk"", whether due to social stigma (promiscuous woman = slut, promiscuous man = stud), the risk of rape/murder, or the risk of getting pregnant.

I also wonder if culture has to play a role and this ham-fisted ""women want relationships, men want sex"" (as opposed to the more nuanced truth of some women/men want one, others want the other, many want *both*) creates a self-fulfilling prophecy and trains men to always want sex.

From infant genital mutilation to shunning child rape victims as ""impure"" to forcing young girls to marry elderly cretins, this is the true face of conservative Abrahamism (that's a fancy word for ""people who believe in and worship the God of Abraham).",hyene,t2_c7gru,2,0,reddit1

I have no problem with parents encouraging abstinence in their households (although I think they should be aware that their child may not keep to those standards). I do have a problem with people giving blatantly false information to their children and passing it off as fact, and half this flyer is just absolute bullshit. 

""Men have a higher sex drive and women have a higher love drive."" - This is just nonsensical, not to mention factually inaccurate. Sex drives vary by person. Some women have higher sex drives than some men. 

""You may end up 'safe,' or you may end up dead."" - Sex isn't killing anyone. Stop trying to scare kids out of sex. Give them facts, not fear-mongering bullshit.

""A condom has a failure rate of 14%."" - Only when used incorrectly, *which is what happens when you don't give your kid accurate sexual information.* When used correctly, a condom only has a 2% failure rate. 

""These same sex 'unions' cannot provide an adequate means of achieving a genuine physical relationship..."" - A lot of same sex couples would beg to disagree.

And that's just page 1! It's completely fine to share your personal sexual boundaries, views, and opinions with your children. It's fine to encourage abstinence. What's not fine is giving your kid misleading, false, or distorted information for the sole purpose of scaring them away from sex.

* assumes women cannot have high libidos. they can and do  

* assumes men always have high libidos. many do not and the cultural assumption that men always want sex leads male rape victims, particularly those raped by women, to be laughed off  

* assumes clothing somehow has any impact on consent  

* assumes sex only belongs in marriage, a ridiculously outdated concept (NOTE: i am not saying choosing to wait until marriage is outdated; i am saying the assumption that most sex does and should occur within a marriage is outdated and frankly, laughable)  

* assumes virginity is not only inherently valuable to everyone, but **THE** most valuable thing to anyone. 

* the demonization of contraception. ""you may end up dead?"" that's straight out of mean girls. yes, contraception occasionally can and does fail. but framing this failure like an inevitability will lead teens to forgo contraception altogether because, hey, what's the point? this is exactly why states that teach abstinence only education, which often features similar fearmongering around contraception, far and away have the highest teen pregnancy and std rates. this is not a coincidence. framing information like this not only doesn't work in preventing teenage sexual activity, but actively does harm.  

* assumes that ""the real purposes of sexual intercourse are to create a new life and bond with your spouse."" again, for many people in today's world, this is just not the case, yet this pamphlet states as fact.  

* same-sex marriage is a legal right in this country for me and my fellow gays, so i really shouldn't have to elaborate on how stupid the following statements are, but i will anyway: scare quotes around ""same sex 'unions'"" , ""contrary to the laws of nature"" (what laws? many species exhibit homosexual behavior. sounds like the laws of religion to me), ""same sex bodies do not even physically fit together"" (then why is the male g-spot in the anus? what about a 4'9"" woman and a 6'5"" man, those bodies don't physically fit together either.) again, i shouldn't have to say this, but same-sex attraction is not a ""struggle"", it is just as real, valid, and fulfilling as different-gendered attraction, and this pamphlet attempts to paint it as anything but. it's the twenty-first century in the west, it's ok to be gay, lmao  

* assumes men are the sole consumers of pornography. the moral question of pornography is an entirely different can of worms but it mostly concerns consent and abuse in its production, not its ""destructive"" nature to men (and porn addiction can and does happen, as well as porn warping people's views of what healthy sexuality looks like, but for most of us, it's hardly some borderline-demonic ""false images"" ""seducing"" innocents)

> Consent or lack thereof must be stated clearly. Where's the problem in that?

With *your* phrasing, nothing. With *their* phrasing, the clear meaning is that women who dress slutty are responsible for anything men do as a reaction to that. It is essentially framed to blame women for men's sexual urges.

> All the STDs listed there are confirmed to transmit via oral sex.

And all of which are phrased to be ""life-threatening and incurable,"" which is false. Gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics, chlamydia can be cured, etc. Still good information for protecting yourself, but the phrasing is intentionally inflammatory beyond what it should be.

> You have a problem with this? It's textbook feminism.

No, it's not, since textbook feminism is literally just wanting equality of the sexes. However, you might be surprised to find that many feminists are progressive about porn, and in fact encourage a healthy sexual relationship with your partner *and* yourself. Plenty of women and feminists have no problem with porn as long as it's not causing any harm to a relationship or creating personal problems (like addiction) for the watcher.

This flier gives blatantly wrong information about sex drives, STDs, birth control effectiveness, and the place of sex in society. Instead of simply providing accurate health information, it attempts to shame, guilt, and scare teenagers away from sex. It reinforces this ridiculous narrative that women only want love and men only want sex. They straight up *tell women* who they want as a partner instead of recognizing that maybe women are people with individual thoughts and feelings. 

This flyer is harmful in more ways than one, but it's far more than simple religious opinion. I have no problem with religious people sharing their thoughts on sex and abstinence with their kids, but I expect them to at least do so honestly and with accurate health information. 

> are you a seasoned veteran who knows from experience that having a lot of promiscuous sex is fine and safe, and leads to an emotionally fulfilling long term relationship?

I can't tell if this is sarcasm or a genuine acknowledgement, but yes, having a lot of promiscuous sex is fine and does not prevent you from having an emotionally fulfilling, long-term relationship if you want.

Many of the photos had such terrible bumps/lumps/etc that you couldn't tell if the underlying genitalia was male or female. Some were really dark with gaping holes where the infection had actually eaten through the skin surface. This was shown in my public high school health/sex ed class when I was in 9th grade in 2006. The health class was an entire semester like a regular class but we never learned about birth control. Just lots of discussion about morality, abstinence risk, and STDs. 

My boyfriend found a video online a few months back about this christian youth group talking about 'sharing' a piece of gum and then relating it to virginity. As in, nobody wants gum that you used so if you lose your virginity you won't get a husband.

Doesn't it make a lot more sense the other way around?  I.e., they're unable to form relationships with women, hence they can't relate to them as people and -- being required by circumstances to relate to them ""from a distance"" -- either put them on a pedestal or resent them?

d6dah42,t1_d6cy4lq,2016-08-11 15:01:03,TwoXChromosomes,"I firmly believe the discrepancy is a result of women being told their entire lives to repress their sexuality.

The difference might still be there, but many women don't engage in ""random, NSA sex"" because they're told if they do, they're sluts. Shit, on Reddit alone, I've seen dozens of guys say a girl isn't worth dating if she goes out a lot, sleeps with more than a few guys in her life, etc. Like you said, women aren't praised for their sexuality like men are. Women aren't encouraged to go out and sleep around. They're told that they're undateable and unwanted if the choose to engage in fun NSA hookups. Some women actually feel immense shame and guilt over their sexual feelings because they've been told their whole lives that those are *male* feelings, and that *women* should only be worried about getting married and having babies. 

Not only that, but as you mentioned, men generally aren't willing to put a ton of effort into a hookup. When someone just wants to get laid, they generally don't want to warm a girl up for 10-15 minutes first and then finish the night by getting her off with oral. Most guys just want to get off and go to sleep. To be clear, I don't mean generally. I am thinking specifically of random late night hookups and things like that. So if a woman (like many women) knows she needs a lot of time and effort to have a truly satisfying sexual experience, and she also knows that many casual hookups aren't going to want to put that time and effort into some girl they don't know, then there's little incentive to make the effort. It almost just sounds like a chore ('Man I'm really horny tonight. I think I'll go find a guy who will let me get him off so I can fall asleep disappointed and sexually frustrated next to some stranger later'). I think if you could guarantee a woman that each of her NSA hookups would result in a satisfying orgasm, you would see a sharp increase in women sleeping around.

> I also wonder if culture has to play a role and this ham-fisted ""women want relationships, men want sex"" (as opposed to the more nuanced truth of some women/men want one, others want the other, many want both) creates a self-fulfilling prophecy and trains men to always want sex.

I think this is true as well. I've heard a lot of men say they feel guilty if their girlfriend wants sex when they don't, because they feel like women have been raised to think that men want sex 24/7, and any rejection is a personal slight against her. I can testify that, in my experience, that is a very pervasive lesson for women, and I've struggled with those feelings in the past. Even though I know, logically and rationally, that my partner's interest in sex ebbs and flows just like mine does, it can be difficult not to take rejection personally when I've been told my whole life that men are ready any time, any where.

IE, 100 years ago like 99% of the populations of midwestern towns were, by modern standards, extremely conservative christians. In my town, there's a picture of literally everyone in town posing at the commencement of the local church. Nowadays, we're lucky to get maybe 15 people in there on sunday, and they're all old people.

Abstinence education is like...gym in school. It's a great tool if you're willing to go out and exercise on your own even when school's out, but if not, it probably won't help very much. That's where more modern sexual teaching standards come into play; it's like teaching people how to exercise at home, instead.",EndlessArgument,t2_x97c9,18,0,reddit1

d6d81h2,t1_d6creg0,2016-08-11 14:03:22,TwoXChromosomes,"Fun fact: semen contains a hormone called Nerve Growth Factor that helps trigger ovulation outright in some species (llamas, for example) and is thought to both trigger development and sustain the growth of a corpus luteum (necessary for early pregnancy to continue) and to improve the vitality and swimming of sperm.  It is not yet known if NGF causes human women to ovulate, or merely makes ovulation and pregnancy more likely.

http://www.livescience.com/22530-semen-may-trigger-ovulation.html

Hell,  our school priest was the coolest priest ever. He was semi openly gay (celibate obviously, but he said that in his younger days he was attracted to men,  not women). I say semi openly because it's not like he was preaching about homosexuality in his sermons, but it was fairly well known and I had a gay friend who was very religious who talked to him about it a bunch. The priest also refused to wear a collar for a very interesting reason. He said after the revelations came out about the cover ups of the child abuse within the Catholic Church,  he never wore one again. He said he was ashamed of the collar and what it now represented. He said he continued to be a priest because he believed in serving God and humanity,  and the best way he personally knew how to   do that is through the Catholic Church,  but he said he refused to associate himself with people who would commit such crimes then hide behind the collar as if having it on automatically makes them a good person regardless of their fucked up actions.

He also apparently refused to go on a school trip to the Vatican because he believed that ""Christians making a pilgrimage to a massive Pallace in Europe to give away their money to view an extensive art collection is probably not what Christ had in mind for his legacy.""

""fake"" does not equal ""distorted"". 

Fake= something that looks like something else, but isn't, e.g. plastic  fruit that look just like real fruit, but everybody knows they are fake. 


Distorted= changing the actual shape & meaning of something, to change its truth value eg. 

the sugar industry presenting a can of sugary drink as a ""healthy choice"" because it has fruit flavour in it, or  photoshopping a picture of two politicians  to implicate they are engaging in shady dealings, when in fact they never met, etc. 


Most porn is disgusting not because it is fake, or explicit, but because it shows a completely distorted, inhuman version of sex, which thrives on exploitation, presenting it as if it is resembles ""real"" sex = what people want from sex. 

Porn made 30, 40 years ago is also ""fake"", but it does not show such an insanely distorted version of sexuality.

Please just read the flier again with calm and avoid glossing its content over with your own personal convenient interpretation. Note the part where it says that wearing a revealing outfit is a ""maybe"", not a ""yes"", meaning, it's unclear/confusing where you stand on the issue, it doesn't say it's a green light to get sexually assaulted. Seems pretty reasonable to me, and if you'd just allow my smug big-boy self to add another thing, I think it's fucking hilarious how your stance relies on pretending that clothing has zero meaning, or that this meaning is something only the wearer should have control over.

So, back to your analogy, I could not wear that big-boy shirt, get drunk, and talk shit to people then be justified in acting surprised when people react negatively.

d6cyxg3,t1_d6crvap,2016-08-11 07:33:43,TwoXChromosomes,"When I was a lot younger I had been dragged to one of those teenager bible camps.

While there I met a girl who became my closest friend there. We talked all the time, we ate lunch together, we found each other to play with during free time and we helped each other through an extremely confusing and emotional time. However we were just friends. I can say I had absolutely no sexual attraction to her.

However EVERYTHING at this camp was constantly centered around sex. At least that's the way I see it. When you make every single activity about avoiding something in particular, when preventing and minimizing it is the central theme of every interaction then you are very much making everything about that thing you are avoiding. The counselors were obsessed with watching us, with making sure we never did anything that might lead to temptation. Worst of all they were watching her for anything she might do that might somehow lead me to straying, and me for any signs I was going to just jump her or something, like they were looking for a reason to blame her if it happened.

The thing is I started to seriously develop a complex. Because I had no sexual attraction to my friend I started to wonder if there was something wrong with me, because according to them I should want it all the freaking time apparently, it should be at the forefront of my mind to the point the slightest trigger will drive me mad... and I had nothing. Not even when we were in bathing suits, and not even when we fell asleep leaning against each other on movie night. (which we got in trouble for.) I later found out I was asexual, and still thought that meant something was wrong with me for the longest time.

Worse though, I was the first male in her life that was emotionally available to her. Her parents were distant, spent little time with her and were usually gone so she developed abandonment issues on top of having cold parents. She told me I was one of the first guys she met that was willing to smile with her, cry with her, just show whatever emotion I was feeling and let it go, and ride along with her. She was glad to have a friend that was actually listening to her, and I was happy to listen to her talk because she was so animated.

Then, the counselors after days of wearing me down started to convince me that this was bad, that I was leading her astray, stealing intimacy that only her and her husband should have blah blah blah (admittedly I think they were more talking under the assumption we spent every minute they couldn't see us banging.) they eventually convinced me to push her away. when it was time to leave she came to me and wrote down her phone number and made me promise I would call her.

My counselor and my friends hounded me until I threw the number away,  then praised me for making ""the right choice for her."" i became just another guy that abandoned her and closed themselves off from her emotionally like all the others she knew, and it was because these people can't get it around their heads that people can be friends, and that even if there WAS an attraction, that people can control themselves.",DuntadaMan,t2_bt732,485,0,reddit1

I had gotten a ride home from a mother of one of the younger (high-school age) employees before. Usually it'd be her and her kids.

One day, though, it was just the two of us. Someone else was going to come along but they had to stop things at the last minute. She asked me to get out of the car. I asked why, and she said she couldn't be by herself with another man.

She can't even say hello in passing (they're in her church) without starting the whole process over. I've received the ""no you don't understand"" talk from her. I do get it. However, you simply can not say a woman's behavior means nothing just because 10% of the population will be assholes either way. Maybe I live in a fantasy world but to me it's simple. Teach girls that some men behave this way. Teach them how to spot them, how to stand up to them, how to get them out of their lives. But don't tell people there's nothing you can do and you will always have problems. You will always have problems with some men. We also need to teach men to stand up socially and physically if needed to these guys. Too many people just laugh it off as ""boys being boys"" when it's actually ""assholes being assholes"". Just so you know where I'm coming from, my youngest daughter told my oldest one day that ""ladies don't burp at the table"". I immediately told her that we do not use that language in our house and that we do not have rules for ladies. None of us burp at the table. Ladies don't have special rules.

As a bible believing Christian (shocker), when presented with my sinful behavior (an event that happens daily), God expects me to confess my sin, and repent, or rather turn from it. If I do not, like saying ""I'm not as bad as that other guy"" or ""That wasn't really bad"" etc. I am not living in reality or truth, something which goes against God's very nature. (God is light, in Him there is no darkness) but to confess or sins we are living in the light of truth and reality and ""if we confess our sons He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."" Basically if we as Christians will not confess our sin, we do not gain forgiveness. And if a Christian, continues to live in sin, whether homosexuality, adultery, or even hate and is unrepentant, they are choosing to live outside God's will for their lives.

Hell, a woman is not even allowed to pray to God directly, they must ask their husbands to pray to God for them, because only men are worthy enough to speak to God. 

Women are still prevented from becoming Elders in Evangelical congregations, women are not allowed to take positions of leadership or authority over men, but men are allowed to have authority over women.

Some women still wear a veil when they go to church, because women come from the rib of Man and as such, women with uncovered heads are impure while men should not cover their heads because they are made in God's image and it's an insult to God to cover their heads.

This is not about lying. The flyer tells teenagers that a woman's clothes can say ""Yes"" to sex, while she is saying no. This is the belief that it's okay if women are raped when they are wearing ""reavealing clothes"" (whatever that may be: in Saudi Arabia wearing Jeans and a T-Shirt probably is revealing, in the US wearing a belly top might be considered revealing - the whole concept of ""revealing"" clothes is just arbitrary).

While that is technically true, giving teenagers absitance-only sex ed evidentially leads to higher teen pregnancy rates because - guess what? - teenagers have sex, whether or not you like it and whether or not you teach them how to have safer sex.
That's why you teach them about about contraception and how to avoid getting pregnant.
Naturally the same thing is true about STDs.

More teenagers have gonorrhea than any other age group.  Sometimes, schools will call federal authorities to intervene when they have a certain number of cases.  Unfortunately, it seems to be independent of the type of sex ed.  Despite sex ed and the availability of condoms, teenagers will engage in unsafe sex and spread disease.  It's a fact of our culture.

You might feel angry about the fear you had of getting an STD, but how would you know how many people in your high school had it?  Is this something they bragged about?  There are 10 million new infections of STDs each year among teenagers in the United States, and you are angry that your sex ed taught you to be fearful of a public health hazard.

Little did they know that 1-we were still virgins and 2-we still haven't had kids 8 years later to their dismay, lol. We stopped attending less than a year after we got married and we have only been back once for a special event.

Shortly after we got married, one of the girls in the youth group got pregnant and her dad was the head deacon. I'm not sure what the backlash on that was but they let her get married there, threw here baby and bridal showers, etc. They just had another baby (first child is 5) and they seem happy but it just seems sad to me.

I would assume not. that part of town is not ""bad"" because of the weather, the wildlife, etc, it is an environment made up of people. you would not go there with a lot of money BECAUSE there is an obvious higher chance of getting robbed. Similarly, not a woman's fault, but certainly to be avoided is wearing provocative clothing in public. You should always treat a gun as being loaded since you do not know if it is or the safety is on, similarly, you should not try to entice men (or men entice women) if you do not know their own moral convictions, etc. You do not know how they will react and are thus playing with fire. It is my choice to open carry a firearm at all times (except swimming ;-)) but as I know it makes some people uncomfortable there are some places I do not for their sakes, not my own. The same of my friend who's family does not agree with men wearing shorts. While I do not feel conviction to not wear my knee length shorts I wear pants while visiting them to make sure they are comfortable. (or heaven forbid their daughter's think that I am trying to act provocatively. etc. In a nutshell, we interact with people everyday. We cannot exist as a society if we act as though our actions do not affect other people. I am not condoning rape or taking responsibility from the man, though in SOME if not MANY cases, the whole thing would have been avoided if the woman had not dressed provocatively, or allowed herself to be in a compromising position with a man. We as a society need to stay away from the ""line"" instead of seeing how close we can possibly get without falling over it. (My apologies if I sound repetitive.)

Edit: And as to your comment of Masturbation and pornography being indicators, I did not say that, I merely indicated that they are an example of repetitive response conditioning. The military has used this with simulators etc for years, you see the bad guy you don't think about the implications you just shoot him. In pornography, you are not presented with a woman saying no, and so you stop and apologise and go on with your date frustrated. No, you regularly present yourself with a situation where you are alone, heavily doped up with Oxytocin, adrenaline, and others, focusing on achieving a release while desperately trying loose yourself in the experience and forget that this experience is NOT REAL. And to the situations where you DO receive push-back (in pornography) the perpetrator either pushes through her rejection anyway (And it is often depicted that she did NOT really mean it.) or he pushes through and it turns into a ""soft core rape"" of sorts where she is simply ""sumbissive"" if not compliant.",Shane_Sears,t2_3j9iz,1,0,reddit2

You don't take a sex education test before being given a license to show you know your shit. 

Simply put, a sex education class without the actual *sex education* is bullshit, and advocating abstinence is not a reasonable position to take on this issue - for one there are plenty of ways to have completely safe, consequence-free sex.

I don't look awful and I have a girlfriend, with no big problem attracting others with a good amount of conversation. I'm definitely not the guy that girls see once and think ""I should get me some of that"" though.

My point is that in my experience, I was taught from a young age to not harass women and that I should treat them as angels, because my parents are from India where misogyny runs rampant. Cool, but any thought of targeting women in general wouldn't have sprung naturally into my six year old mind. That's of left me with a really weird notion of how to pursue women I'm romantically interested in. Sometimes I have to remind myself that women want men, too - not every single initiation is seen as sexual harassment like I was raised to believe. Luckily my gf came on to me, because I would not have her if she didn't, due to those weird hang-ups.

Also, due to various circumstances out of my control, I've kind of been isolated from having friends of the opposite sex for the last few years now. I have no women in my life who I can call up just to hang out, and very very few men. This past weekend I was out with my gf and one of my friends and his friends who brought along a normal, average girl. Every time she talked to me, I couldn't bring myself to even look her in the eye in response - I was afraid she'd see that as unwanted sexual attention of some sort. It's so rare for me to even speak to a girl my age that I can't handle the event when it does come up.

The other thing about paedophiles is that they are masters of making people feel sorry for them. They use this to play the victim and get others to help them out of tricky situations - ""I can't believe my own daughter is accusing me of this!"". 

This is why I hate every time this question comes up. It reeks of ""I can't help being attracted to children! Please help me!"".  No. You are a sociopath who manipulates everyone around you.

> We teach at best baseless morality and expect people to react morally.

I am assuming you mean things like, ""...masterbate whenever the urge hits, and watch pornography at any and all times."" Except society doesn't teach those things. Unless you're talking to different people than I am, we don't encourage watching porn and masturbating at the dinner table, or at work, or on the bus, or at the mall, or in the grocery store...What we *do* teach is that it's okay to do those things within reason and within the privacy of your own home. That's not baseless morality. That's embracing our nature and not putting so much morality on what ultimately amounts to nothing more than a biological imperative. Sex and the urge to masturbate are completely natural in the most pure way (as in, we literally evolved to procreate). 

So since I don't believe society teaches ""baseless morality,"" I do expect people to behave morally. However, more than anything, I expect people to act based on what they know to be right or wrong. Most children learn that it's not appropriate or socially acceptable to get angry, throw a tantrum, or hurt people when you don't get your way. That is all we are suggesting here - that men reach back and remember some of the first behavioral lessons they ever learned, and respond with grace and maturity to rejection instead of getting angry at the women for what they presumed were misleading signals.

 We got the same, but the STD portion was graphic, it was scary AF but drove the point home.

Funny story- when we got the sex talk in basic training, a drill sergeant put a condom over his head. He told us that any man who said he was too big for a condom was no one we wanted near our lady garden. Of the six drill sergeants present (1 female) he was the only one who seemed comfortable. He asked if anyone had questions about contraceptives, or prophylactics. My dumb ass asked if dental dams would be covered.

This lead to my hosting an impromptu Q&A about WTF a dental dam was, how the fuck *I* knew about them and where they could be procured. From soldiers and drill sergeants.

There are 43 million youth ages 10-19 in the United States.  60% of them had had sex by the time they graduated high school.  Of the 20 million STIs *reported* each year, half of them, 10 million were among teenagers.  There are infections which go unreported and untreated.

Based on this data, I do not see how it could be a misconception that sex as a teenager has a rather high probability of contracting an STD.  If teenagers are scared about having sex as teenagers, they should be.  I was and didn't become sterile or acquire a life long medical problem.  It's not a misconception to believe that the chances of getting an STD from this guy pressuring you to have sex are too high for you.

d6cy48p,t1_d6cw66a,2016-08-11 06:54:26,TwoXChromosomes,"It may be a problem, but calling it a problem does not make it go away. The internet and ease of access to pornography does not have much effect on it either, and it is not just in America. This is when puberty starts, and kids are curious and try new things. Even before the internet took off, 13 year-olds were still beginning to explore sexuality at that age (Frank Wedekind wrote on the subject as early as 1891). Some, hold on to that innocence, and I think that is a great thing, but many don't hold on to that innocence. Many start even before middle school. I believe it was popularly called ""playing doctor"" at the younger ages.

Let me be clear, I don't believe that 13 and 14 year old kids should be running around and having promiscuous sex with each other all over the place, but sexuality is part of who we are. It is built into the very fabric of our DNA. Curiosity and urges will arise, and these teens should be educated enough to understand the consequences of each action, and the multiple ways to prevent certain consequences. Abstinence is great, but in the real world abstinence is not always practiced. 

We, as teachers and parents, should not be afraid or embarrassed to talk to teens about puberty, sex, safe sex, or the repercussions of being sexually active. The kids will be the ones making these decisions, and if it is approached correctly, they may be more likely to make a safe decision than an unsafe one. 

In answer to your questions; in terms of science, middle school aged students may not be 100% psychologically ready to be sexually active, despite the fact that all of the hormones are beginning to kick in and play on the psyche, but they are physically, and physiologically ready to make those decisions. At 13 years old, all of those parts are awake now. Those hormones are telling the mind to do things, and decisions must be made. A parent can say ""Don't have sex, don't masturbate, practice full abstinence."" The problem with that is that teens will ignore parents and do whatever they please, keep it a secret, and the parent is none the wiser. This is why it is best that they know all of their options, and all a parent can do is hope for the best outcome.

So, ladies and gentlemen, offer to put your daughters on the pill, offer your sons and daughters condoms if they need them. Talk about sex. It is all better than being a grandparent at 40 (or younger).",jimmycurry01,t2_9h91s,4,0,reddit2

Nope. Kids *are* sexually active from a very early age on. Actually as soon as babies can move, they start to touch their genitalia because - well it feels nice.
Infantile sexuality is different from adult sexuality though.
Obviously children shouldn't have real intercourse. But even they know it's nice to touch themselves and - if you let them - they will try it together with other children. Modern approaches to sexual pedagogy propose this is beneficial to the development of a healthy attitude about sex.

The big problem about pedophilia is that the difference in power between an adult and a child is just too big to allow healthy, consentual and equal sex.

>Children are becoming sexualized earlier and earlier every year, because of how easy porn is to access.

As far as I know, this is not true, at least not to the extent it is generally assumed. However, if it were true, wouldn't it be even more important to give them comprehensive sex ed at an early age and not wait till they are 18, as proposed by /u/tikiman7771?",ManusX,t2_kqlij,2,0,reddit2

Our ""urge"" is not for a solo act of masturbation, and we can receive a temporary respite from those feelings, but I contend that the ""urges"" are for a complete and fulfilled relational sexual experience which was developed by a relation-by-nature triune God. (exists as the trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) For our enjoyment and to solidify ourselves into a ""one flesh"" marriage relationship for life. Complete in a similar triune nature. (God, Husband, and Wife) I have seen no evidence (and quite a bit to the contrary from experiences of friends, family, and others) that having multiple sexual partners (monogamous or not) has positive benefit aside from NOT having to engage in the very self-control you are claiming is so pivotal.
as to the ""Baseless Morality"" comment, I suggest that you are referring to ""ethics"" not ""Morals"" ethics are more broadly defined and can be determined by the general trend of public opinion, while morals are unwavering and stand aside from public opinion. e.g. (and this is a terrible example but) Lying is morally indefensible but has become so commonplace in our daily lives, i.e. a used car salesman ""stretches the truth"" we all know it is a lie but we just shine it on as a normal part of life.

This is the part I have a problem with. It's the same logic as 'all men are potential rapists, they just don't act on their urges'. Having a physical attraction to someone doesn't make you a potential rapist/abuser. It not only demonises people, it's also dangerous because it completely misunderstands the mindset of people who do actually abuse. People who abuse do not do it for sexual gratification nor do they do it because they can't resist their urges.

First of all, you should recognize that not everyone is religious. I am an atheist. I do not believe that I have a ""need"" to absolve myself of anything, nor does anyone else, so this will inherently be a difference in opinion.

>  but we not only promote it often but teach children that it is as you say ""natural"" and ""acceptable"" 

It is natural. Masturbation is found all throughout nature in various animal species, so yes, it is natural. I suppose whether or not it's *acceptable* is a matter of your own beliefs, but I absolutely think it's acceptable.

>  Our ""urge"" is not for a solo act of masturbation

No, it's for sexual release. That can be found through either masturbation or sex.

> I contend that the ""urges"" are for a complete and fulfilled relational sexual experience which was developed by a relation-by-nature triune God. (exists as the trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) For our enjoyment and to solidify ourselves into a ""one flesh"" marriage relationship for life.

You might contend that, but it's false. I fully respect your right to believe in a god, but the biological purpose of sex is procreation. It has nothing whatsoever to do with marriage or emotional connection. Sex, as a biological act, is for the purpose of procreation, although some animals enjoy it for pleasure (like us!). Humans are, in the end, animals, and are therefore driven by animal urges. All animals on earth have a natural urge to spread their genetics, hence why all animals have the desire or urge for sex. Human beings have been having sex long before the concept of religion even presented itself. 

> I have seen no evidence (and quite a bit to the contrary from experiences of friends, family, and others) that having multiple sexual partners (monogamous or not) has positive benefit aside from NOT having to engage in the very self-control you are claiming is so pivotal.

Well there isn't really any empirical evidence to support either side here. Sexuality is very personal - everyone gets something different from expressing themselves sexually. Some people find empowerment and enjoyment out of multiple sex partners. Some find it freeing, or it helps build their confidence. Those are all positive benefits of having multiple sexual partners. *You* might not find those same benefits from that same behavior, but I could just as easily say I see no evidence that being religious or going to church has any positive benefit aside from not having to worry about going to Hell. For me, that's true. For you, that behavior might produce an entirely different set of benefits.

> as to the ""Baseless Morality"" comment, I suggest that you are referring to ""ethics"" not ""Morals"" ethics are more broadly defined and can be determined by the general trend of public opinion, while morals are unwavering and stand aside from public opinion

I mean you made the original statement, so I'm referring to whatever *you* are referring to. You said we teach ""baseless morality,"" but I don't know what you mean by that, so I used what I imagined was a relevant example from your post. I still contend that we don't teach ""baseless morals."" For example, we don't really teach that lying is okay. In fact, we teach that tactics used by scummy salesmen are the exact opposite of honest and respectable tactics. What we might teach is that sometimes morals are hard to apply to a specific situation, so morality is flexible. For example, if a woman is 8 months pregnant and asks her husband if she looks fat in a dress, it's probably in the husband's best interest to say no. Is that true? I mean, no, since she's heavily pregnant, so she probably does look fat in that dress. But why should he tell her that? Clearly she's asking from a place of self-consciousness, and clearly she's in a delicate emotional state, so the husband might tell a small white lie to stop her from getting her feelings hurt for no reason. Is that indefensible? I certainly don't think so. 

> Again, thank you for the polite conversation, but perhaps we should limit it to a single vein of thought at a time (Morals, Societal norms, Marriage as an institution, Biblical theology, The existence of God, The Family Unit, etc)

I was under the impression that we *were* talking solely about one topic: how we educate teens and children on sexuality. To which I would answer: teaching from a place of religion is wrong. I am not religious, and I do not want my children being taught religious standards in a public school. I expect a publicly funded school to teach my child *factual* information, not religious information from a religion I do not support. Now I think the topic of sexuality and religion is very interesting in and of itself, but what that ultimately boils down to is always, ""You believe what you want, and I'll believe what I want."" The problem is the clash between religion and secularism in public education. ",hennesseewilliams,t2_101ymh,2,0,reddit2

Keep in mind I didn't go to seminary or anything, but this has just always been my interpretation. Also, I apologize for the lengthiness of this reply.

Essentially, Jesus didn't *have* to die in order for our sins to be forgiven. God is perfectly capable of snapping his fingers, or batting an eyelash and all would be forgiven, etc. The reasoning for Jesus sacrificing himself goes all the way back to the book of Genesis, the first book of the Old Testament, which recounts creation and the events following shortly after the emergence of humanity. 

In the creation story, God creates the Garden of Eden, where Adam and Eve live in communion with God, and in the Garden, God plants two trees, the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Adam and Eve are told by God that they may do whatever they please, and may eat the fruit from any tree but one, the Tree of Knowledge. The story goes that Satan came forth in the form of a snake and tempted the two to eat from the Tree of Knowledge, which led to both Adam and Eve eating of the fruit of the tree, imbuing them with the knowledge of ""right and wrong"", and ultimately disobeying God and being cast out from the Garden. This act is commonly known in Christianity and Judaism (and possibly in Islamic teachings, though I don't know enough about their scriptures to confidently say) as ""original sin"". For what reason God saw fit that they shouldn't eat of the tree and that the consequences would resonate to all of humanity, we cannot know.

At this point, humanity has fallen from the ""good graces"", so to speak, of God, and all of humanity now suffers the consequences of inherent sin. Throughout the Old Testament, in order to receive forgiveness from God, animal sacrifices, most commonly in the form of a blemish free lamb, must be made. While I don't recall all of the specifics, my understanding is that the continued sacrifices appeased God and kept them in his graces, granting the people forgiveness of their sins.

Going back to Genesis though, before Adam and Eve were cast out, God himself sacrificed an animal for Adam and Eve in order to create clothing for the two, so they would not be set upon the world without his aid. Up until this point in Genesis, all of creation was perfect and blameless, including the lamb that God killed. This is what set out the framework of the act of the Israelites sacrificing a blameless and blemish free lamb, and ultimately culminating in Jesus' sacrifice. It essentially bring the story of forgiveness full circle, starting with God granting mercy upon Adam and Eve by killing a blameless creature for the acts of his chosen creation (humanity), followed by God allowing his chosen people (the Israelites) to follow suit as a form of their own repentance to God, and finally God sacrificing not only his son, a blameless man who led a life devoid of sin against God, but himself (as Jesus is the physical manifestation of God), as the final sacrificial lamb for all of humanity to share in the benefits of. This is also why Jesus is referred to as ""the Lamb of God"".

This is the reason for Jesus dying as a means of atonement. It is to show his love to his people. God sacrificing himself to forgive the sins of all.

I will put a disclaimer here that I do not believe that the events told in the book of Genesis are a literal depiction of what is going on. I, along with many other biblical scholars, believe that the story is allegorical, and spoken to humanity by God as a means to explain himself to the people at that time in a manner they would comprehend.

>I do not believe that I have a ""need"" to absolve myself of anything

I understand this. But if I am a KKK member and don't believe there is anything wrong with killing a black man, I will still go to jail/be executed for it. Not beleiving God exists will not change your destination. Besides: Romans 1:20 ""For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse."" (Thus the urgency when a Christian attempts to share the gospel. It is not ""OK"" in our estimation for us to just let atheists/agnostics/etc just believe what they want to believe. If we truly believe the bible and we truly care for others [as the bible calls us to] then will not simply leave you on a path leading to hell. We should at least TRY to point you in the right direction. You may not agree with it, and you may be annoyed by it, but if a christian truly CARES about you, they will not just let you be.)

>Masturbation is found all throughout nature in various animal species

I never contended that it was not natural, but it is also natural to attack another creature that has something that you want, or crosses you, or on occasions have sex with other species. (True it's mostly dogs) That does not mean it is to be embraced as moral behavior, anymore than taking what belongs to someone else because we a re bigger/stronger.

>whether or not it's acceptable is a matter of your own beliefs, but I absolutely think it's acceptable

Acceptable, I suppose IS a matter of beliefs, but we can choose our actions but not our consequences.

>The large next block from urges to humans being animals.

Again, I am pointing to a biblical foundation (and you may contend how ""firm"" that foundation is. (Please read this next part carefully and realize I am NOT being combative.) But you appear to be making assertions, and have seen few if any basis for. Many of them appear (and this may be my interpretation) to be ""well everyone knows"" points. Perhaps we should drop this topic and move (Perhaps in a different forum or in PM due to context) rather to the topic of origin of species that is truly the basis of both contentions. If I DID truly believe evolution was possible or happened, then I would likely come to the very same conclusions that you appear to have. We need an ethical way to hold a society from chaos and keep the strong from preying on the week, although there is no reason for them to do so, aside from public opinion, or threat of consequences.

>Well there isn't really any empirical evidence to support either side here. Sexuality is very personal - etc

I agree that it is a difficult to ascertain point as to the limited scope. I will toss out that, publicly available/commonly passed around information (the most popular) on this topic is somewhat one sided as people who feel empowered would also tend to be vocal compared to those who feel deep shame and depression, who would be somewhat in the minority vocally, but still present.

>""baseless morality,"" ...ect

Again, Morality is only flexible WHEN it is baseless. If morality is based on something unchanging (The word of God) then it does not sway based on public opinion. The lie is still a lie. No matter the situation (and I am sure you could bring a dozen difficult fringe questions to the table and we could debate them endlessly, but that does not shake the fact that it is a LIE. Thus Sin. (Also, there are many ways that particular example could be handled. I myself would look her in the eye, and tell her that even though I don't care for the dress, it is made better because the most beautiful woman I know is in it.;-) 

>teaching from a place of religion is wrong.

Based on?

>I do not want my children being taught religious standards in a public school.

You are welcome to this opinion.

>I expect a publicly funded school to teach my child factual information

Agreed, and that includes evolution as a THEORY, as well as Creation as neither can be reproduced in a lab. (though if we shift the conversation, Creation is far more logically repeatable [even if simply by aliens{though this simply shifts the argument one step further}] than evolution.

>not religious information from a religion I do not support.

Agreed, one of the many reasons, I do not support the concept of ""public schools"" and tax dollars aside, will (Lord willing) never place my children in the public school system. Training my children up in the way they should go is my God given responsibility, and not to be shifted for convenience sake to any other entity. Especially the ""hands off"" approach to public schooling that has become so common.

Whether you believe the bible or not, teach your kids.

>The last paragraph

Please first refer to my comment about truly caring for another person. And second, I would contend that the problem is either 1. a lack of education, or 2. the clash between man and God.

Evolution and secularism are attractive because they teach that you can be a god. Achievement is the highest form in the universe and if you achieve YOU are god. If you want it you need only to achieve enough to take it and nobody can tell you no. And most of all, when you die, there are no consequences.

> We should at least TRY to point you in the right direction

Which is fine. But that does not involve integrating your religion into the public school system. Those of us who aren't Christians don't want or need your religious guidance, and while you might feel that it's your duty to continue spreading the word, it's my duty to ensure that my children aren't being taught incorrect information that could threaten their health because of a deity someone else believes in. That's too far.

> That does not mean it is to be embraced as moral behavior, anymore than taking what belongs to someone else because we a re bigger/stronger.

But how do you define morality? Your morals come from religion. My morals do not. Your morals do not supercede my morals, so why do you assume that Christian morals should be applied to everyone? Which is what I assume you're supporting, since we're discussing public education in a public school system.

> If I DID truly believe evolution was possible or happened, then I would likely come to the very same conclusions that you appear to have

I am not trying to be combative, but all the conclusions I've come to are facts. It is a fact that sexual urges are in our biological nature, and are shared by all animals on this planet. We know, for a fact, that all species have an innate drive to procreate. Evolution is as close to fact as it could possibly be, so I'm not sure how you can say you don't believe it's even possible, but that's another topic for another post. 

> . If morality is based on something unchanging (The word of God) then it does not sway based on public opinion. 

Right, but not everyone's morality IS based on something unchanging. My morality is fluid. I can adjust my morals when given new information. I don't lack morals because I lack religion - I simply lack rigid morals because I lack an unchanging moral source. But my morals, while fluid, are no more or less valid than yours. So yes, a lie is a lie, but my morals allow me to recognize when lying is moral and when it is not. Yours do not. Again, fine, but why do you seem to intent on pressing your morals onto me?

> Based on?

To be clear, I meant teaching *public education* from a place of religion is wrong. You are free to teach whatever you like in your own home, but I don't believe in teaching from a religious perspective (ANY religious perspective) in public schools.

> Evolution and secularism are attractive because they teach that you can be a god.

Not for me. For me, evolution and secularism are attractive because religion makes no sense. There is no evidence of God. When you press religious people on their religion long enough, it falls apart. On the other hand, there are mountains of scientific evidence for things like evolution and fossilization. I believe in what science can prove, and what facts can show. Religion has never shown me science or fact. To me, religion is born from man's fear of death. Death has always been an unknown factor of life for thousands upon thousands of years. Humans, in one form or another, have been on this earth for *millions of years*, and no one knows what happens after you die. That, I firmly believe, is the sole reason religion exists. People were scared of the great unknown so they invented a man in the sky who protects them from the darkness. 

All differences aside in religion, my PRIMARY concern with this debate is the separation of church and state. I am always happy to discuss the validity of religion (seriously - feel free to PM me if you'd like to continue), but in the context of this particular thread, my focus is on religion's place in public schools. And to me, there should be no place for religion in public schools aside from general religious education. While I recognize that it is a Christian doctrine to go out and spread your message into the world, that does not mean I have to deny my child accurate scientific information because somebody else wants to feed them lies about a man in the sky that watches them masturbate. All I ask is that religion be kept far, far away from education other than historical religious education.

Honestly, when you don't have kids it's incredibly easy to just *assume* that it can't be that much work especially when you equate being home all day to having free time.

After having a kid you realize just how much work they are! Newborns can be up all night, meaning the time you have in the day is either spent feeding them, changing their diapers or catching up on the sleep you missed and even as they get older they continue to be a ton of work in a variety of ways. 

Having said that, parenting was a good wake-up call that I have no fucking clue what it's like walking in other peoples shoes. I used to make judgments about all sorts of things, how bad this group ""must have it"" or ""what their struggle must be like"" when in fact I don't have the slightest idea wtf I'm talking about.

Not to get all preachy, but I think this is why it's absolutely critical to get a variety of people in political positions who together represent population. You can't keep electing a group of rich old white christian men and expect them to pass laws that are suitable for women, minorities or transgender people. As many of them are probably a lot like how I used to be, both uneducated in struggles other groups face, but think they know to pass laws greatly affecting them.",CommentToBeDeleted,t2_kvpo6,456,0,reddit3

Not uncommon for people to criticize new parents for not cleaning their homes meticulously, or heaping a whole list of things they need to do.  Many forget the fact that part of the maternity leave process is physically healing from birth.   

People give you shit over every aspect of child care.  Not all, but a shocking number. 

I got people giving me shit for not making my own baby food, for using disposable diapers, for not taking them to the park everyday in 90 plus heat at a month old.  I got shit that I wasn't trying to teach them sign language.  I had twins, 22 bottles a day at one point with 30 plus diaper changes at times. Lest we not discuss the laundry, lack of sleep, etc.  I got zero sympathy from most, a ton of critiques.

I have grown deeply resentful of my friends without children because they always know more and we have done everything wrong.  I ruined my children's ability to sleep for life because I refused to let them cry themselves to sleep every night. (They take about 5 minutes to go to sleep these days).  I have ruined their diets for life because they were not happily eating sushi, brussell sprouts, octopus, etc by the age of 3.  I should have starved them into the diet I wanted for them.  Real good idea starving 2 year olds. I have abdicated my parenting because I let them play with ipads a for short periods every day.

My worst crime by far is buying a house for them so that they didn't have to share a bedroom for the rest of their childhoods or go to a school racked so low there wasn't much lower to find. They now have a bedroom, two if they want, two playrooms and a yard.  This was selfish and I should have stayed in the city so that they had better access to the museums, because that is what 5 year olds are really into. Screw the bad schools I should have just gone private.  I could have dug up the $150k a year that would have costed if I could even have gotten them in at all!

fw2ym4z,t1_fw2v848,2020-06-26 17:24:21,TwoXChromosomes,"Baby sleep in short spurts. They don't sleep through the night because they have tiny tummies. They need to eat small amounts every 2-3 hours. No amount of sound proofing trumps that biological need. If they eat every 2-3 hours , you best bet that diaper changes are occurring with the same frequency. So you have this cycle of feed, sleep, waking up screaming with a dirty diaper, change diaper, calm baby, try to feed, repeat that lasts months. Eventually they are awake and asleep for longer stretches, but every growth spurt and illness can lead you back to shortened sleep. 

SIDS is also a huge concern when they're newborns. You want to check on them quite frequently because sometimes new lungs and brains forget how to work together. Sleeping in the same room ( not int the same bed) can help with breathing regulation. Sometimes despite parents best efforts,  their child dies of SIDS in their sleep and everyone is devastated. 

Now bedtime routines do help establish better sleep, but its definitely not a one size fits all situation. Some babies have acid reflux and can only sleep when held because they are so incredibly uncomfortable when laying down. Some babies sleep through the night as soon as they come home and their parents feel blessed or superior in some way. And we are also talking about just one child. Now imagine doing this with twins or multiples. Imagine you have a 2 year old sharing the same room so now when you go to comfort an infant int he middle of the night, the elder child also needs to be helped back to sleep.

Sleep is hard. Sound proofing a room is far from a good idea for many reasons.",mariescurie,t2_axq7t,30,0,reddit3
fw2wlgs,t1_fw2v848,2020-06-26 17:08:27,TwoXChromosomes,"A lot of it is that babies need to eat every few hours so even if they theoretically don’t have any other problems through out the night (has, diaper changes, random fits of pique) you’re still not gonna get a full nights sleep. Also babies just need more sleep so they need those naps during the day. Once they start getting older (think a few months old) then you can start letting them self soothe (cry it out and make them just stay in their room) but even that isn’t a perfect opportunity. Basically the way I think of is that a baby’s only way of communication is crying so if they’re crying that means they have something to say, and when they’re super little it’s important to check on them bc they’re vulnerable little helpless creatures that depend entirely upon you for life.",hughesish,t2_yzu5d,32,0,reddit3
fw2x76r,t1_fw2v848,2020-06-26 17:13:15,TwoXChromosomes,"Newborns *can't* sleep on the same schedule as adults, because they have to eat every 2-3 hours.  They have small stomachs, which require small but frequent feedings.  They also need to sleep between 12 and 16 hours a day, so you can't just keep them up all day.  If parents placed newborns in a separate sound proof room and ignored their cries all night, it would almost certainly affect their growth and their psychological well being - newborns need to know that someone will come when they cry.  In addition to that, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends room sharing until at least 6 months, because of the risk of SIDs.  The idea is that the parents should be in the same room, so they can notice any sounds which may indicate the baby is having trouble breathing.

As the baby gets older, letting them ""cry it out"" becomes a more acceptable option, but it can still be pretty controversial.  You'll find a lot of parents have really strong feelings about it.",allnadream,t2_n8rzm,27,0,reddit3

The difference is incredible. They also have no bladder or bowel control so they have to have their diaper changed every 2-3 hours otherwise they get rashes and wounds. Newborns need to be held and comforted for proper emotional development. 

Many parents do sleep train at 6 months or older once baby is stronger, can eat solids, poops and pees less often, and has a strong emotional bond with their parents.

Before the box fans, a small noise machine worked ok, but they really seemed to less than the larger fan.  Transferring them from the car to their rooms to finish naps seemed to also go better when running the fan in the background.

Before our third was born, we switched to a larger shop fan (bought for the garage but our room's fan broke after it arrived).  It's been awesome.  It could just be that he's a good sleeper, but I feel the fan has helped a lot.  It's so effective that we can't even blow it at our bed otherwise it shoves air under the comforter.

I was prepared for the struggle with my second. But I could just put him down somewhere or just get up after feeding him to sleep and he would nap a good 2 hours.

It doesn't work well, and most of us stuck with minimum maternity leave don't have the sort of jobs that can be flexible or work from home.

I had six weeks to the day with my first, seven with my second (including two weeks of bedrest at the end of pregnancy, I actually returned to work five weeks postpartum) and four weeks after my third, having told my boss I needed ""at least a month off"" and being put on the schedule four weeks to the day after delivery. 

It's exhausting and painful and messy - I was still leaking milk and blood and a hormonal mess. But my leave was unpaid and even if I could afford more time off I would lose my job if I tried to take it. Also, I used what vacation time I had to get at least some pay during that time, which meant I went back to work full time, had a newborn and toddler, and wasn't entitled to another day off for somewhere around 18 months until I earned more time off....

fw32429,t1_fw310vq,2020-06-26 17:51:51,TwoXChromosomes,"You did what you could! People have so many reasons why they don’t breastfeed. 

My daughter was born in December and I had the hardest time breastfeeding for the first month. Feeding sessions lasted 40 mins at a time, and it felt like she was biting me the whole time (even though of course she didn’t have teeth). We had been told at 2 weeks old there was a mild tongue tie but nothing crazy, I just needed to persevere. Well, I decided to get a second opinion when she was a month old because frankly, my nipples were on FIRE 24/7. I cried when I fed her, and her jaundice wasn’t going away fast enough. 

The lady I went to was amazing and said her tongue tie should’ve been operated on weeks ago. She had an in-home surgery and snipped it then and there, and immediately breastfeeding didn’t hurt and time was cut in half. Turns out my daughters tie was such that she couldn’t curl her tongue around the nipple to suck properly and that’s why she was gumming me. 

If it weren’t for that lady I would’ve 100% given up breastfeeding. She was my last resort. Breastfeeding is not just a physical thing, it’s very much a mental thing too. You don’t owe anyone an explanation. If your baby is fed and healthy that’s the most important thing! 💚",Little_Numbers,t2_2omlws1z,60,0,reddit3

I attempted to breastfeed my kid for the first 2 months, but I wasn’t making enough milk and she was losing weight. I decided I would exclusively pump (so baby would at least get some milk) and supplement with formula. My mother in law questioned multiple times why I wasn’t nursing her, and made me feel like shit. I worked SO hard just to feed her and the last thing I needed was judgement. She was like “I can’t believe you get up in the middle of the night to do that!” So, first judged me for not nursing (I couldn’t!) then judged me for pumping. Well ok then..

Husband and I have since decided to keep her completely in the dark about what is going on with baby because she always has something to say. She gets to see her on FaceTime, but we don’t tell her anything like weight percentiles, minor health issues etc. I could go on and on all the things she has made us feel like horrible parents about, so this is what she gets.",soulsista12,t2_kthjv,2,0,reddit3

If you're in a rural part of America, then you're living at a place where you might not even be offered AP classes or anything like that. And mainstream America is OBSESSED with itself. Americans think they are living in a democracy, they actively force themselves in other countries to ""establish democratic leadership"", but end up killing thousands and helping establish regimes that help the American interests in some way. Most Americans do not know about any of this. About our selfish interference in Latin America, Afghanistan, etc. MOST PEOPLE think we are a do-gooder democracy. Most people think America is fighting terrorism, when it is, in fact, creating it.

When the cold war became a thing, that was the end of socialism in America, really. There was such mass hatred against USSR and everything they stood for that was perpetuated by the politicians at that time, that after a while, decades after and even during the cold war the spread of anti-communism actually HELPED politicians establish an oligarchy in America. 

We are a far cry from the nation Lyndon B. Johnson had left, or FDR, or even Nixon for fuck's sake. That guy actually openly praised America's social security nets during the kitchen debates. 

But greedy politicians ruined America. After the rise of Conservatism in America as Reagan came along, social security nets were cut, this narrative that government-funded anything (apart from meaningless wars) was communism spread across the U.S.. This was great for evil health insurance companies and various other businesses. Even many of our prisons are privatized. Politicians are reluctant to do anything about that, or legalize marijuana because the people arrested and jailed for that plant are the fuel of the prison business. Can you fucking believe it?? People are making wearing masks an issue of politics, they claim that BLM movement is communism, that lock-downs are communism. Everything that remotely asks to de-establish white supremacy, or move towards a healthier, more egalitarian society is somehow communism.

It's so weird to me that people who are themselves subjected to this atrocious system, who are paid shit with no benefits and no rights, are the very people who support the oligarchs. It's a very efficient strategy to maintain the chain of excessive consumerism and make people believe that it is for the best. So the government takes your taxes, and does absolutely nothing to help you. It's the big businesses they care about. That also don't pay any taxes. Wow, just wow.

fw3khhq,t1_fw2pohz,2020-06-26 20:21:49,TwoXChromosomes,"> As a Canadian, I think we get 6-9 months of maternity leave, plus paternity leave. As a parent, I know how crucial the early years of child development are.

Maternity leave is roughly 15 weeks (varies from province to province slightly, but it's in that range). This can only be used by the birth mother. It's essentially medical leave to recover from child birth. So an adoptive mother wouldn't be eligible for maternity leave.

Standard parental leave is up to 40 weeks, but one parent cannot receive more than 35 weeks of standard benefits. 

Extended parental leave is up to 69 weeks, but one parent cannot receive more than 61 weeks of extended benefits.

The major difference in standard vs extended is how much you receive in government benefits. Standard pays out up 55% of eligible earning up to a weekly cap of $573 a week. Extended leave spreads that money out over a long time, so you get less money each week for a longer period - up to 33% of eligible earnings with a weekly cap of $344.",canadian_maplesyrup,t2_r97s2,2,0,reddit3

There is NO WAY I'd be ready to go back to work, especially if classes were in person and I had to be on my feet the whole time.  My body isn't just healing from childbirth, but I'm also trying to get my body to stabilize from severe postpartum preeclampsia.  Preeclampsia & its risks don't magically disappear once you deliver like they used to think.  You're a risk for it up to that 6 week postpartum mark.  Mine started to develop within 48 hours after birth and they sent me home on a blood pressure medication that didn't work.  Wound up in the ER and readmitted to the hospital the next day.

So, definitely not medically capable of being back to work yet.

I'm lucky, though.  I'm a community college professor and our union just this year negotiated for paid maternity leave in both the districts I work in.  So for my 8 week summer courses 6 weeks is paid maternity leave and then 2 weeks I'm using my never-used sick leave time to still get paid.  I also don't qualify for FMLA since I'm an adjunct and don't work enough hours at any one campus to meet FMLA rules, but my state does have other leave protections in place.  (I'm in California.)  So I can either get a doctor's note for pregnancy disability leave or I can take parental bonding leave and use my sick time or half-salary.

Since fall is fully online, I'm not going to bother taking a full 12 weeks off.  I don't have enough sick time for that anyway.

The same law (Family and Medical Leave Act) covers maternity and other kinds of medical leave.

So the same people who don’t qualify for maternity leave typically also aren’t protected if they need to go to the hospital for other reasons, like the car crash you mentioned.

The second bank, I had spent two hours on the phone with a loan officer and it was clear I was the one responsible for gathering documents. My husband chatted with him for 5 minutes, basically long enough to say he gives approval for the bank to discuss his finances with me. Like, I'm not worried about the man starving to death if I died, but I do worry that he won't know how to handle the finances, he's so uninterested in anything beyond his allowance. Anyway, the loan officer sent the secured documents upload instructions to my husband's email, because apparently he's the one responsible for managing the loan application now? This loan officer got heck from me, because he would have had to dig up my husband's email after I had already given mine as the primary contact for the loan.

The charity I ended up not saying anything to because I can claim a spouse's charitable contributions on my own taxes in Canada anyway, but I was still annoyed. After years of donating as a single person and receiving receipts in my name, the very first time I donated using a cheque from a joint account, they issued the receipt to the second name listed on the front, that is, the obvious male name versus the female name. I wonder what they would have done if we'd had androgynous names.",one_bean_hahahaha,t2_dmv83nko,227,0,reddit4

When I was in my early 20s, but out of my parents' home and independent, I still had the same insurance agent that my parents had.  The then current one had taken over from the one I knew as a kid (family friend), but I knew the staff and they knew me. 

There was a snafu with a payment (before I did online payments), and the office manager called me.  We cleared it up, and I was leaving a payment in their drop box that night.  She told me it would take a day or two to show up in the national system - but that I would 100% be covered if I got into an accident, etc.  She had made the appropriate notes, etc. in my file.

So, my dad was talking to the agent, and unbeknownst to the office manager... THE AGENT LOOKED UP MY SHIT AND TOLD MY DAD I WAS BEHIND ON PAYMENTS AND NOT COVERED.

I happened to be at my parents' when he got home and came in hot, pissed that I was driving uninsured, and was delinquent on payments with someone he does a lot of business with. 

I IMMEDIATELY fired back with how the hell he got that idea, and why, when they were conducting business, were they TALKING ABOUT MY BUSINESS.

He knew he fucked up then... he let the cat out of the bag.  He didn't want me to, but I called the office manager.  She was equally pissed off.  We both read that agent the riot act with his patriarchal bullshit - at that point, my policy wasn't attached to my parents', I was working full time, and had just purchased my own home.

kdejllx,t3_18iig79,2023-12-15 01:32:57,TwoXChromosomes,"When I bought my first house, I had two male friends move in renting rooms from me. It was a new build and had some issues, so there were handymen etc coming in and out fixing things (paid by the construction company thanks to a clause in my purchase agreement), and one of my friends was unemployed so it was convenient for him to stay at the house to let them in when I was going to be at work. 

I set up all the fixes and arranged what needed to be done with the construction company, in writing. The top of the vanity in the bathroom had been put on crooked, so there was a pretty significant slope to it, and a gap underneath that went from nothing at one side to big enough to stick a finger in on the other. I’d told them that it needed to be taken off and replaced level. The guy came into the house, looked at it, and said to my friend, “soooo… I can just fill the gap yeah?” My friend said “don’t ask me, I’m just the tenant, you need to do what she said in the letter”. 

Guy filled the gap and left. I came home, looked at the stupid thing, and sent off an email saying that was not acceptable and needed to be redone. 

The owner of the construction company phoned me the next day and started yelling at me that “the guy said it was fine!” I think he was very surprised when I cut him off and said that for one thing he did NOT say that, he told me what he said and it was to do what *I* wanted, and for another thing even if he *had* said that he would have had no authority to do so because it was *my* house and he was just the tenant, so send someone back and tell them to do it right this time, thank you. 

That was the same builder who had a whole bunch of single power outlets put in where I’d specified doubles. I noted them on my pre-settlement walkthrough and he had to send an electrician back to replace them; I was available to let that guy in, and casually mentioned that the builder had said the electrical subcontractor had made a mistake. He laughed and told me that the builder had told them to put in singles because they were cheaper and faster to install, and “the purchaser is some young chick who won’t notice until it’s too late”.",snootnoots,t2_ni0sjuh,56,0,reddit4

kdh9b33,t3_18iig79,2023-12-15 15:58:26,TwoXChromosomes,"I get this garbage about appliances and warranty info. Even though the appliances are less than a year old. Lol. ""I'd like to talk about an extended warranty offer!"" Blah blah blah...


It always seemed to go like ""May I speak to dude?"" ""No. He's at work. This is my phone. Not his."" ""But I need to speak to the homeowner..."" ""I AM the homeowner. One of two. But *I* picked out the appliances, *I* made sure they were delivered and installed, and *I* paid for them. Therefore, I. AM. The. Homeowner."" I usually let that sink for a second. Then I add. ""Got a problem with that?"" Dingbat would excuse themselves with have a good day and ending the call. I finally lost my patience on dingbat one day and added some stuff.


""I had the seed money but didn't know how to invest it safely. He used his skills as a financial manager to make it big enough to buy a farm for me because I've always wanted one. My money, his time and effort. I AM. THE. HOME. OWNER."" (note, I wasn't really screaming. I don't know any reddit formatting tricks to add to insist that I was making sure every carefully spoken word was being heard loud and clear.) Which is mostly true. Lol. Then ""His name is first on the mortgage because I lost the coin toss. Each joint account we open we decide who is in charge of what account by coin tossed so the workload is fair."" I finally got her one day with ""Why are you so insistent on talking to him and not me? I'm not good enough to own anything because I'm female? He told me he used my number for signing up for a talk because he wanted you to talk to ME about the appliances. All he knows about them the the shell color and where the start button on the microwave is. And yet you keep calling me but refusing to talk to me. I'm starting to think that your company just wants piss me off. You did. Congratulations! Don't call back. Ever.""


The annoying thing is that said dingbat who has been pestering me multiple times for a month was female too. I'm very good at recognizing voices in movies or TV shows, but pretty much face blind when it comes to recognizing the actors/actresses themselves. I knew that this same airhead had called me multiple times recently. I can understand that she didn't know that because her computer was dialing for her, but still...is she really getting it through her head?


As far as the home/auto goes...we have the house and multiple vehicles. We both consult each other about the house portion, but hubby chooses what discounts to use for his rides, I choose for my two trucks. An older, lightweight summer truck, and a recently purchased monster for a plow/farm truck (limited driving to save on gas. Needed a monster because last year we got 11feet of snow in one week and we have a super long driveway and elderly relatives that might need us to go get them if the local emergencies services are too overwhelmed to help like last year. Not fun). I did take his input into consideration when choosing color, features, etc but the final decision was mine and mine alone. So on each truck, I'm the owner, he's authorized driver. Lol. Basically, he didn't care what was bought since it was going to be my baby monster, not his. I would have been fine with either of my two final choices, but I picked the gas because he didn't like test driving the diesel one. He said it felt weird even though I didn't notice the difference between diesel vs gas. And diesel fuel is cheap but the maintenance and parts is more expensive in the long run. So, gas it is. So now I'm a monster truck's mommy and he's the occasional babysitter.


Our agent is a great guy and knows about all this, so he directs the info to me because he knows that hubby isn't easily reachable due to work rules but that he can get a hold of me anytime. He doesn't insult me, he just texts both of us the same time and knows I'll call him back after we discussed things together. Or if I qualify for something on one of my trucks, he'll just go straight to me instead.



I do have fun with telemarketers. Like extended auto warranty calls. ""You're going to cover my vehicle? Awesome!"" What make and model? Chevy. Um, but our info says you have a Subaru Forester...oh, no I've never owned a Subaru. My hubby does, but I'm not telling you that! Lol. Or I'll barely get anything past ""it's a 1994..."" Before getting someone desperately trying to still be polite while fleeing verbally. ""Sorry but we don't cover things that old."" (I know, dummy, that's why I said it. Lol). Can't wait for them to figure out I got a new truck. 😈 . ""Sorry but your offering is pathetic to what I got from the dealer. And they didn't charge a penny because I paid in cash! How exactly are you gonna beat that price plus they'll cover what you don't or won't?""  I'm gonna have SO much fun....... 🤣🤣🤣🤣. Or maybe I should use the bubble brain thing. ""OMG, you mean I can actually put a warranty on a vehicle that already has one and is still covered by it? That's so awesome! Sure!"" And see how they respond to that one. I suppose if I'm busy I could just do ""Dealer says their truck, their warranty. Go argue about it with lawyers from Ford. I'm busy.""


So many say telemarketers are awful. I say they're fun.


Fun to annoy.


I know they're just normal people just trying to do a job, but calling more than once a month that no, I'm too young for Medicare *and still not understanding that* means all bets are off after you annoy me *nine or ten times a day* if not worse.

The only time we mention marriage is if the owner of record is Firstname middleinitial Lastname and the seller on the AOS is SameFirstname Samemiddleinitial NewLastname at which point we make a comment something like ""Seller appears to have changed their name due to marriage"" just to explain why, despite the different last name, they are the same person and it's not a scam (which should be the job of the title company 😒).

She had this asshole come in and try to either remove his wife's name or close the account.  She was the manager (that he demanded to see) and she refused, unless his wife was present or there was a court order.

Not probably, it is. When I was going through my divorce 20 years ago, you couldn't close an account without both parties being there and they flat out told me that was the reason. I really just wanted my name off the account, so I just did that instead. Thing is, it doesn't really stop someone from screwing you over. I could've just withdrawn the money. Or he could've.

The link you provided describes sharing information being acceptable so long as the context is related (involved in care, etc) and there is reasonable belief that the patient would not object to it or it would be in their best interest (incapacitated). The Department of Health and Human Services states ""the HIPAA Privacy Rule at 45 CFR 164.510(b) specifically permits covered entities to share information that is directly relevant to the involvement of a spouse, family members, friends, or other persons identified by a patient, in the patient’s care or payment for health care"".   


With that said, mailing and addressing her test results and health information directly to her husband without written authorization doesn't resemble any of the department's provided examples due to a lack of relevance. I think it would be different if he were provided this information verbally or written in person when he is actively involved in her care and/or payment, but after the fact seems way wrong.",flyleafet9,t2_knsdm,11,0,reddit4

I have so many examples but the best one was I text the builder asking could I turn something back on (they’d switched it off to do work and left it off when they went home for the day). The guy called my partner and said yeah it’s fine to turn it back on 💀 

He had no idea what it was even about as I was home and he was half an hour away at work.

You were clearly concerned enough with your health to schedule an appointment. What you were owed in this visit is a thorough exploration of your symptoms and to make sure and rule out any concerns for serious illness say, pneumonia, with a full set of vital signs including pulse oximetry and a complete history and physical examination. You were owed tests to easily rule out viral diseases with potential treatments (which you did receive with the COVID and flu swabs). While tests for other respiratory viruses exist they are not easily accessible, are expensive, often aren’t covered by insurance, and usually don’t change management. If there were concerns for something more serious radiological exams or blood tests might have been warranted. Otherwise, you were owed some reassurance, some expectations for the course of the illness, and counseling regarding returning for worsening symptoms or symptoms to watch out for. Then, an offer for a work note so you can get needed rest to heal and a specific treatment plan with recommendations of specific names and dosages of OTC medications that are proven to help with your symptoms and offer symptomatic relief. Some prescription cough medications and inhalers can help with bronchitis if that is what is diagnosed (but *not* antibiotics.)

I think all of this is what you were owed and what you should expect during a medical visit when you seek someone’s medical expertise. I would be concerned with the visit being surmised by asking you what you want and like my other comment on this thread, you should pay attention to the credentials of whose medical expertise you are seeking in the future",Chironilla,t2_1ilg78q,7,0,reddit1

NP is writing the script, RN is just the one who pulls the trigger on sending it for you after the conversation.

Azithromycin is really common to treat bronchitis with, and if you have been coughing and -then- developed a fever there's a higher likelihood that you have a secondary infection brewing on top of whatever viral you started with. Paired with severe fatigue and persistent fever, not unreasonable to toss a z pack at you. Plus azithromycin has some anti-inflammatory effect on lung tissue per some studies. 

Some providers prefer other meds to the z-pack because of developing resistance concerns, so they'll use doxycycline or augmentin instead.

What we have here is that doctors can prescribe it to you but generally prescribe it if you meet certain criteria. You have a positive COVID test, it's within 5 days of symptom onset, and you meet some kind of high(er) risk category, have more serious symptoms, or symptoms that are worsening rather than improving.

The group that I hesitate about are people who don't fit any high risk categories and their symptoms are relatively mild, because I think this category of people are likely to be at highest risk of not completing the course and at spreading the resistant strain to others.

I likely wouldn't suggest tests on my own outside of covid testing in this case.

My reasoning is this is almost definitely a self-limiting illness. It doesn't *matter* for treatment which virus she has, the treatment is the same: home, rest, fluid, OTC symptomatic management.

Arguments against testing: discomfort for the patient, drives up the patients cost (she'll have lab charges for a flu test that doesn't change what she's going to do about it, and many people are angry about this if they perceive that testing to be unnecessary), discomfort for the patient. She may have already tested for Covid at home and not wanted to spend time testing again. 

OP could have been there for any reason - wanting OTC meds prescribed to try to force insurance to cover them, a covid pcr test because they didn't believe the rapid, a work note, trying out antibiotics, a full viral panel because they just want to know. Without her explaining what she's looking for in this visit, there's a good chance the doctor is going to get a bad response to anything they do because people's expectations vary pretty widely.

k9d9uch,t1_k9d2bms,2023-11-15 15:38:52,TwoXChromosomes,"I am very optimistic. We've made *so* much progress with immunotherapies for autoimmune disease since the 90s, which is overall a very short span of time. We're targeting very specific pathways in the immune system with these agents, which means that side effects tend to be very mild - especially compared to traditional drugs like steroids. And we've rapidly started to develop second and third generation biologics, giving broader options to physicians and patients to find something that works.

My experience with biologics has been amazing. I was worried before starting, but I've had almost no side effects and my arthritis is controlled. Seriously - I would sing the praises of biologics from the rooftop. I realize they don't always work for everyone but for me they've been amazing.

And while money is controversial, drug development is largely spearheaded by private companies looking for profit. The reality is they support research that has the potential to make money. These drugs have also been very, very financially profitable (Humira and AbbVie is a great example to look at)... It's of course a double-edged sword, because cost limits access once the drug is released. BUT, with the way the current system is, this profit encourages drug companies to continue to invest in immunotherapies and doing this research. Biosimilars (generic forms of biologics) are starting to be available, but without the initial core investment and development by a drug company the biosimilars wouldn't exist (the drug to mimic must exist first to mimic it...). 

Drug companies have learned that immunotherapies are a profitable market, so I'm optimistic they will continue to invest and perform research in this field. That gives hope to people with more rare autoimmune diseases as well, as companies look to expand their label indications, and more general research gets done and published on the immune system. It does seem like a number of autoimmune diseases share common pathways (drugs are often approved in multiple indications like arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's, psoriasis, etc) which means a drug might initially be developed targeting one disease but also be useful in another.",LuckyMacAndCheese,t2_dy8wigt,2,0,reddit1

They could probably narrow down her diagnosis more but it doesn't matter in her case exactly what it is.

I think honestly this entire thing is an isolated case. Part of it is that OP didn't see a physician. Part of it is what she came in with - the expectations from the population around what is done for a respiratory virus vary widely but are also deeply held. In most cases, a physician would just offer the appropriate care and testing without prompting, not need step by step instructions. And there was certainly a better way for this NP to ask OP what her concerns were and to address them. I can also iamgine the NP is just sick of people screaming at them when they suggest to rest and drink fluids, and therefore they just give what the patient wants to avoid that unpleasantness.

When i asked him to stop talking to me ab my boyfriend and keep things work related he told me he’d have him banned from all the local bars (which he has close ties to). He’s also told me he doesn’t expect us to work out bc he doesn’t think we’re good together. He’s got no context to believe these things. ",bethalj,t2_xfcfj,20,0,reddit2

What this guy has done to you is not **legally** considered harassment. 

In order for it to be considered harassment, **first** you have to tell him, verbally, that his actions are unwelcome. Until that happens, it's just miscommunication, teasing, or a personality conflict. 

After you tell him to stop, the next time is considered harassment. 

Every manager receives training on this very thing. 

So, even if your boss believes you, if he didn't tell you to verbally protest the next time it happens and then start a paper trail with HR, then he's doing you a great disservice. Basically what he's told you is that he will have your back, but what he's actually done is made you dependent on him for protection, while doing nothing to protect you legally.

e6yooc6,t3_9kcjpi,2018-10-01 12:05:29,TwoXChromosomes,"Couple things to add. Find out if the manager and coworker X are buddies outside work. You may not be aware of it (some people really hide it pretty well) and it could have a huge effect on the dynamic going forward. 

Even if they aren't friends, the manager telling you something in a certain way (emphatically conveying his support, etc etc) will not necessarily be conveyed in that way to coworker X. Manager could just warn him about you or give him a heads-up (like ""hey, head up, so and so is complaining about you, I'm sure you didn't mean anything by it, etc,). Hopefully not, but don't take anything at face value. 

Also, once coworker X gets wind of this in whatever way, it might be a bit tougher for you to get further evidence of his behavior (as many people are recommending you try to do), or he'll change his behavior to instead harass you about accusing him or he'll defend himself with ""hey remember I said she didn't like me? Well, now she's accusing me of this..."". Once he hears about this, he'll have the opportunity to plan his own defense and really turn the whole thing on you. Prepare for that. Will your manager name you specifically when he confronts coworker X on the behavior you mentioned to him or will he give you anonymity? What is company policy? Will HR be there or just the manager and coworker X? Etc etc. 

Be ready for anything. Write everything down. Get legal advice if you can, find out HR's policies in your company, etc etc.

That said, remember that managers and HR are first and foremost officers of the company.  We sometimes find ourselves acting as advocates of our employees (against individuals *in* the company) but it's safest to assume that your boss/HR will work within the law to protect the company.  Sometimes that means taking action and disciplining or  cleansing the company of a perpetrator.  And sometimes the criminal is just too smooth to leave any evidence or witnesses for the complaint to amount to much.

He would tell me how much he liked an outfit or how he thinks I should wear my hair. I tried not wearing makeup to look less attractive at work and he explained how he thought I was absolutely beautiful without makeup. I was the youngest female at work. Everyone at least 10 years older than me. The women hated me and I didn't know why so I couldn't talk to them about it. My boss started texting me at like midnight on weekends about how the sky was so beautiful or the weather was perfect to go swimming in his personal pool. I always ignored it and never replied. He had children around the same age as me. A son exactly the same age and a daughter a couple years younger. He would stand in my office for hours at a time just talking to me. If I got up he would follow. It got so bad that if people needed to speak to him they would call my work phone and ask to talk with him. It looked BAD. Like real bad. He was the HR manager. I didn't know what to do. Then.. one day.. He came to me and said some things that made me come forward with my story to people above his head. He told me that if I wasn't going to be his friend outside of work then he knew someone who was interested in my position. That changed everything. I was fried for not being a ""friend"" to my creepy boss who harassed me every day OR possibly be fired with coming forward with the harassment case. Possible lose/lose for me but I decided I would lose fighting. I took a vacation day at work.. went downtown to people above him and told him my story, e-mailed them screenshot and asked them to speak with others about his behavior. After an internal investigation they decided that he would no longer be able to speak with me about anything non work related. A month or so later he resigned for a better position offer in another company. And I was finally able to explain to all the female coworkers who hated me that the attention I was getting was unwanted. That I didn't know who to go to since they hated me. Some of the males in the office would ask me if I felt okay with him being around me all the time. I was honest with a couple and explained the situation because I trusted them. They told me I needed to let someone hire up know and supported me the whole way through the process. One of the guys would come stand near my office when he knew my boss was in there to make sure nothing happened. My boss took this as a threat and went and literally yelled at the guy's boss telling him that he needs to keep track of his employee and that his employee was stalking me and harassing me. Ironic right? Anyway. It took me about 4 years and I was scared of losing my job but when I learned I would lose my job if I didn't accept his advances I finally decided to go down with a fight. And I still have position. I'm still employed. And every one acted like they didn't know what was going on when they all did.

The owner would often drink at work and would occasionally send leading texts when out on work trips. I shut them down so quickly. He would also really enjoy finding ways to put his hands on my legs... When I was pregnant with my first.. under the table in a meeting. I'm sure my quick chair adjustments away from him were quite noticeable. 

In the end he started an affair with my co-worker instead and she greatly disliked me. I can only imagine what he told her about me. She got him to attempt to fire me. He didn't because I think he knew his reasoning was so pedantic I'd get unemployment if I so chose without question. I applied for a job that day, got it a week later, and put my notice in. 

I didn't work much after the attempt to fire me. I just sat at my desk in my massive empty office, browse the web, and drink coffee. He'd moved a very close friend out of mine so we'd each be alone a few weeks earlier.  I had no horse in the race, so to speak. I was done. (Edit to add that the close friend was the mistress' semi estranged sister... so it was a strange workplace dynamic and I'm thinking my closeness and friendship with the one encouraged the hatred from the other. She was fired/quit about a week before I left after being given a position most people work many years to achieve and had pressure on her constantly to manage the position perfectly.)

I was his right hand in the company, handling every office related function, all AP/AR processing, invoicing, and picked up the slack on projects I'd never learned a bit about. 

He hired his mistress' best friend after I left, who would get drunk to fit in, and eventually fired her because of it. He contacted me a few months ago but I didn't respond.

To be so clear, I have ZERO ill feelings for him. He is on his own path making his own decisions as I am on mine. To him I wish mental clarity and true acceptance of self and others.",,,2,0,reddit2

In my opinion, a gentleman should straighten this person out.  It would no longer be a problem.  It seems like this doesn't happen any more.  When I was a kid, if one of my friends came to me about a man getting out of line, I would put the gentleman on the straight and narrow.  It seems like, even with the #metoo movement, it isn't happening.  The men just keep getting away with it.  Even with the increase in pressure to not be a bastard.

There's only one thing that good men are good at.  It's straightening things out with those men that don't know how to behave.  This was always assumed when I was a kid. Every kid had to make sure that guys didn't get out of line. A female friend comes to you with a problem, you make it go away.  Easy.  No one likes to be that guy, but sometimes you have to make the bad guys back off.

It just makes my blood boil when someone takes advantage of a situation when they are in power.

What he was doing to OP is pretty standard 'grooming' techniques and you don't just start doing that as an adult without being brazen/having fallback/practise. Especially as he's a family man - he probably has this stuff down to a T. If someone at work is a 'flirt' that is professional code for 'creep but not bad enough to sack'.

It's different as everyone who works there feels this way, but the customers, public and therefore potential employees think he's great - my old director made me feel very uncomfortable. However my manger was his girlfriend/partner and the other director, and I felt trapped. Director didn't say anything to me, he generally ignored me unless he needed something, but he said stuff AROUND me to other female members of staff - like the intern and one of the cooks. He also treated the men like shit so he wasn't sexist, just an arsehole. He delighted in making everyone feel uncomfortable and inferior.  However it was never 'officially written up' (me and his girlfriend were HR so that would never have happened), never ever openly talked about or addressed - all his customers think he's some eccentric arty wonder boy.

The investigation may take a few weeks, but you should see things happening and should receive communication from your HR Reps immediately. Following up with it now starts the paper trail, ends the behavior, and helps to protect OP from retaliation.

Then the bosses would change the policy that you had to wear shorts. Silly but makes as much sense as them saying you can't.",Da_Kahuna,t2_almey,138,0,reddit3

The female guards were wearing standard one piece sport suits covered by a sun shade identifying pinny, also they were all ages 16-18. I've never felt happier about shutting someone down than in that moment quoting guard standards.

I don't think folks realize that in a situation like that the 'supervisor' is usually someone barely a few years older who is then responsible for the guards and everyone else in the area, it's a pressure many adults wouldn't be able to manage.

 I'm not sure my response would have been as brave had they not confronted me in the open on the beach with quite a few witnesses who were regulars I trusted. Had the wife been able to corner me on my way back in the more secluded office area I might have not been able to act while feeling like I wasn't in immediate danger as well. Even after quite a few years reflection the fact that it would have been very easy for this to have gone incredibly poorly still bothers me.

It’s a small aspect of the whole. And focusing on being a “nice guy” often means the guy feels he doesn’t have to do anything else to get a woman he likes. Woman like men who have whole personalities, who treat them like humans. Yes, *some* women end up with jerks, either through choice or because they don’t realize how bad the guy is until a lot of feelings are involved. That’s because they’re human and make mistakes or have other things going on. Some men only seem like jerks to people outside of the relationship or because the “nice guy” thinks he’s better. 

Men need to get rid of this whole concept of “nice guy”, especially when they think that it entitles them to a girl. No one is entitled to anyone no matter how they treat a person.

*understand physical requirements for safety very well* and that not all women (nor even all men) can perform to the safety standards.  It's not discrimination, thank you for not being that idiotic.  

I could lift the 50 pound radio in the army, and meet the 70 pound lift requirement for the police department...but I could never do the 250 pound drag for the fire department.  

Lift with your legs.  Not your back nor arms.  Get under it, get a good hold, and straighten your legs.  Your legs are much stronger than your back, and if you are lifting right, anything you do to strengthen those thighs will help with lifting.

Good luck on getting the office job rather than the plant.  Just understand these minimums are necessary for your safety as well as others.  Everyone has their own fortes, and not everyone has to be the same.  Yes, an overweight man might be able to pass that strength test, and be able to lift chemical containers required for the job.  At least you wont be the girl who stands aside on the job and lets the men do all the lifting, insisting on getting the same pay for lesser work.  (we used to have those in the police department after our department dumbed down standards for women...I would go rushing into the bar fight with the men, while physically deficient female officers remained outside.  And they got the same pay while my risks, abilities, capabilities and performance were much higher, and on par with the best of our male officers.  Well, at least I got the big promotions and they went no where in their careers because at the end of the day, the couldn't do the job they were hired for.  Be GLAD you aren't going to be that girl, given special favors to work in the plant when you really can't.

Most healthy adult people of whatever gender should be able to lift that easily, if they only had the sense of how to use their bodies properly, along with a little conditioning. 

I'm female, 5'7"", 135 lbs, and 46 years old. I do construction work, mostly carpentry along with a variety of other general stuff -- drywall, running wire, some roof work, etc. I carry heavy stuff all the time, including up and down ladders. I hate gyms and haven't seen the inside of one in years. The best way to gain strength quickly is to do work that requires you to use your body all day. Unlike lifting weights in the gym, the strength you gain through working is useful strength, because it's all about developing an intelligence between mind and body about how to use the strength you have (along with leverage, etc.) to safely and effectively accomplish the tasks you need to do. You gain an intuition about exactly how to lift heavy items, carry them around for some distance, and otherwise manipulate them in a way that lifting a barbell just can't accomplish. Guys I work with are constantly surprised at how much I'm able to lift, carry, and muscle around, given that I'm not that big a girl. I tell them it's got nothing to do with my actual strength, and everything to do with how I've learned to use it.

They should not.  Let's say you didn't meet the other requirements - regarding various mental skills or education or whatever.  Should they let you work regardless?  Of course not!  And so it should be the same with the physical requirements.

>I wasn't worried because I work out 5-6 times a week, doing cardio and strength work for every workout ... But I couldn't lift more than 50lb safely for the tests.

I'm assuming you don't lift 50 lbs in your workouts then.  If you did, you would've been able to during the test.  You need to ramp up your strength training.  That being said, it's probably gonna take a while for you to be able to lift 50 lbs comfortably, if that's where you topped out currently... you may be SOL this time.

>in all reality an overweight man who's never exercised could probably pass that strength test.

His strength level has nothing to do with yours.  His fitness has nothing to do with yours.  His capabilities have nothing to do with you failing your test.  Don't bitterly blame strawmen for your own shortcomings.",EssEffOh,t2_bh973,7,0,reddit4

If you had taken the job and been tasked with lifting 50+ lbs objects, it's only a matter of time before you'd get hurt.   If your back goes out, you're not good to them and you're stuck on sick leave.    Please don't hate me for saying this but maybe it's better you don't work in the plant at all?   All it takes is for you to have to move one 60lb object, you do it the wrong way, and your back is permanently damaged.   

If you have your heart set on working in the plant, you could perhaps work with a good trainer to see where you can get your strength safely up to.     But for the time being, if you can get office work, that sounds like a much better job.

It's a good way to fuck up your muscles and joints if you do it improperly, without good form, and without strength training.

People blow out their back so often at work nowadays specifically because everybody de-emphasizes working out your back, making it weak and therefore easier to blow out.  It's a paradox - companies, in trying to make workers use their back less, end up with workers whose backs are so weak from disuse they'll blow out more easily!

Deadlifts (along with squats) are an important component of a core workout.  If you deadlift properly and safely, when you DO have to lift with your back, you won't fuck it up.

Each week you add 5LBS. 

He also watched how I lifted to pinpoint weak muscle groups and gave me some exercises to work on those areas. So each day would be the big set of 10, plus a few additional exercises like tricep extensions or lateral raises. And I try to do crunches every day just because.

/r/fitness has some really great info in the FAQ. Basically, any variation of Starting Strength or 5x5 Strong Lifts will progress you quickly towards the goal of getting stronger.

Exercises I would recommend focusing on are:

Pull-ups, Barbell Rows, Bench Press, Press/Military Press, Squats (LOTS OF SQUATS), and the Deadlift.

The accessory exercises are largely unnecessary until you are already very strong. I would recommend training every other day when you are first starting out. It doesn't matter how sore you are or think you are. You can work out every other day when you are starting out. Each work out should be total body. However, definitely don't try to train every day.... You make gains when recovering!! When you first start working out you will need those days inbetween.

The first couple of weeks I would work with really light weights and focus on form until you have it down. If you have any more specific questions feel free to reach out to me.

I would go through and read about the starting strength program or strong lifts first.

If you can't do any of the exercises listed above do the toned down version of the exercise. For example, if you cannot do a pull up try doing lat pulldowns or assisted pull-ups.

In my own lab, there are many people whom I'm sure can't lift more than that: we've got some people who are quite old, a woman who is <5 feet tall and one of the tiniest adults I've ever seen, etc. A good solution is just to figure out a way to fairly distribute any tasks that do involve lifting, and/or involve a safety risk for someone who can't lift a large amount of weight. For example, if it's not safe for you to do some particular minor task because of the weight issue, maybe your boss or HR can appoint another employee to do that for you, and in return, you can be given a task of theirs.

Disclaimer:  I don't do the HSSE stuff, but I work closely with the people that do HSSE for our chemical locations.

It's a safety rule and put in to keep people alive, not put in for fun and games.  Chemical plants have a bad habit of going boom if people don't follow the safety rules, and that means people get injured and may die.  If there is an evacuation and she has to open a hatch to get to a safe spot she has to be able to lift that hatch.  Otherwise, if she can't evacuate on her own someone else has to put their life in jeopardy to save hers.  

Lots of equipment in those plants are designed to handle large forces and that tends to increase their weight.  Safety equipment more so.  

It sucks, it really does that she can't get the job because she couldn't pass the physical, but if it's a safety test, then there should be NO accommodation.  You can either be safe on site, or you don't go on site.  Visitors that don't do the test (on our sites) are escorted at all times by someone that has passed the test and is responsible for that visitor until they sign out at the end of their visit.

I agree with you that proper form is important. This is crucial. I am a big stickler on form.  As far as anecdotal evidence goes I have never injured myself squatting ever and I have been doing  heavy barbell squats now for 3 going on 4 years. The rate of incidence of injury for weight lifting is far lower than that of running, especially when it comes to knee injuries.

The majority of injuries from weightlifting in competitive lifters are from overuse (training too frequently). This is something most people are unlikely to experience because few people train as hard as competitive lifters and as frequently.

For example, the labs at my work all have different rules regarding clothing, electrostatic discharge issue, and who is permitted to go in there. There are labs I've never had to work in, and probably never will; if I had a work duty that would necessitate doing something in that lab for 2 hours per year, but I couldn't comply with the safety rules, then I think it would be extremely reasonable for a coworker to do that task instead, while I took on some task of theirs.

I remember asking a guy on a first date what he did for a living after the initial small talk. He immediately responded with, “so straight to the interview questions.” His mood and demeanor immediately became salty. 

I’m sure he had other issues he needed to deal with, but that experience kind of scarred me. From that point on I always waited til the guy offered the information in the first couple of dates. Because honestly you never know where someone’s triggers are, and how they’ve been burned in the past. 

In some cases, though, it’s had the opposite effect where the guy would be very candid saying he didn’t think I took an interest in him because I didn’t ask about his career.

This is what online dating has done to us. We assume the worst in others. We’ve completely lost the ability to engage with others without building walls around our insecurities and triggers.

I don't need to know their income or job location, but I want to know what they do. I have a career that I worked hard for and any partner would need to have a similar work ethic. Money isn't the most important thing beyond ensuring that a potential partner isn't debt ridden, but I wouldn't sit through a date only to discover after the fact that he lives with his parents and works part time. 

I make 3x as much as my partner, but he works his ass off at his job. Regardless of income earned, he takes pride in doing a job well (even if the job sucks), he follows through and can be counted on to be a true partner. Someone's job and how they talk about it can tell you a lot!

Also, wouldn't you want to know asap if someone was a gold digger? So you don't waste time getting to know them?

I asked her why she brought that up after our fun weekend and it turns out that she had recently gotten out of a bad relationship. The guy she was in a relationship with previously was older than her, verbally abusive and emotionally distant, and barely made any money; about $18,000 a year. I could understand why she would be concerned: I believe a woman has a right to know if the man she is spending time with is emotionally, mentally, and financially stable.

I am fortunate enough to come from a well off family (not mega bucks/family wealth level but my parents worked director level jobs by the time I was in my mid teens) but I learned as a teen not to let people know (not as in, don’t broadcast it but as in actively avoid answering questions in ways which could give it away) and to just come across as average. Even in non-romantic relationships people can get weird about it. I had a friend come to my house to the first time and start making comments how they felt they should be cleaning my windows or something and not a guest.

My (now) husband didn’t know until we were over 6 months in and he came to stay at my mum’s. He was chill because by then we’d talked finances and he knew it was my parents money, not mine, but his family still to this day make occasional “posh” or “rich” comments towards us.

But even now, we chose to buy in a cheap area in our county - it has no station, town centre or anything so prices are significantly lower as a result - so that we could afford the size of house we wanted in the long term. As a result, we own a much bigger house than most of our peers who have chosen to buy on the other side of our city which is far more expensive and in reality their houses likely cost more than ours did. However we now get comments on being well off and people being weird that we own a 5-bed detached in our mid 20s. They won’t hear that it was a choice and they could do the same if they wanted. We have a big house = we must be rich.

We earn roughly the national average salary each (£1-2k above) and do not have any finances from anywhere else but that apparently doesn’t matter if you have something which signals “wealth”. 

Long and short is that people get weird about money and act differently. If he’s experienced that then I wouldn’t blame him for keeping a clearly high paying job quiet. I would respect the desire to want to know someone is really interested in him and not his money. I would say though that he is probably new to this approach because the outright denial draws more questions - he needs to work on the art of being vague if he wants to genuinely keep quiet the fact he has money!",Rubyeclips3,t2_fautj,-6,0,reddit1

From what you had said about the date, it's my opinion that your feelings might be getting the best of you. But, if I don't have the correct understanding, and he was totally rude and off-putting about it, then, he's kind of being a snarky smart ass.

The thing is, I'm often conflicted with stopping to understand the other person's perspective. I have to stop myself from getting upset, and remind myself that everyone has the right to withhold information they're not comfortable with discussing. That's where trust and rapport play a role. Granted, he doesn't really *know* you, nor does he owe you anything at this point, BUT it's generally common ""small talk"" for the beginnings of a relationship. To me, he sounds like his past has given him a reason to feel guarded, and he gave you a reason for his reluctance. Sometimes we need to take that information at face value for what it is, and respect their boundaries.

I once dated the ***sweetest*** boy (19) when I was young, and, tragically his mom was wrongfully killed in a traffic accident that involved a Semi trailer breaking free from the Truck, when he was only 16 years old. He never had a father in his life, so losing her was absolutely devastating... While we were dating, he showed for the first time, some frustration with me, and voiced he was concerned I was ""only dating him for his money"". I was taken aback and confused, and asked him ""what money?"" And he said ""the money I received from the settlement."" And I had no idea what he was talking about, and told him that I wasn't aware he had money (we both worked / met at a grocery store at the time). He thought he had told me about it, and the look on my face said I was clearly not understanding why he would think I felt that way about him. 

We set clear boundaries for our relationship (no sex for example) and it was a pure, and honest relationship. I told him I didn't need to know how much money he had, as it was none of my business, but, ultimately he said to me ""basically enough to pay for me (him) to graduate from college, pay rent for my apartment, and food, for the next 5 years."" Essentially, he ""didn't need to work"", but, to him, spending that money was like slowly losing what he had left of her day by day.

if8nt5s,t3_vta5o2,2022-07-07 18:36:51,TwoXChromosomes,"Sorry Ladies, but you're wrong here.  Do not ask men what they do for a living on a first date.  You have boundaries, so do men.  Many men are skeptic that women value money too much.  Just let him share that info with you when he wants, if he's smart, he'll do the same.  You could ask if he wants to talk about his work, or if he likes his job, which gives him an out, otherwise I suggest you wait until the 2nd, 3rd, or even 4th date to ask that question.  If you have enough connection by then, he might already have shared with you.  

If you have an expectation a man shares what he does for work, then I hope you're a professional yourself and are on some professionals site, otherwise you may be putting men off.  

I'll give you some perspective: men enter relationships for love, companionship, to create a family and sex.  Thus is key.  Almost none of those have to do with money.  Knowing what we value will help direct your curiosity and questions during early dating.  Early dates are interviews and figuring out if there is attraction/chemistry.  If either of those are related to money for you, you'll likely struggle here.  If this is the case and he doesn't want to talk about employment or anything related to money, it won't work.  


TL;DR:  If a man gives you vague answers about his work, it might be that he doesn't want money to be part of the initial meeting process, so it's likely intentional.  And he may not want to rule you out right away, either.  So if you must, then leave him with outs, see how it goes.",GripsAA,t2_kppjf,-5,0,reddit1

But...

I don't enjoy talking about work on dates because outside of a handful of creative fields (screenwriter,  producer, etc)  jobs are boring and the resulting conversation is cringe-worthy, the worst small talk imaginable. The best dates or convo's bypass the work conversation entirely. And on a first date, who cares what they do? **You're years away from having any type of financial dependence on this person.** 

I had a friend who I knew for months and they joked that they didn't know what I did for a living. I never hid it from them but we were always out and having fun together vs talking about ""what corporate tasks do you do to make a paycheck?"". Eventually we learned we were both in consulting and that was that.

In capitalism, many can't afford to have an interesting job, and it's not what emotional stability is tied to.

That happens with people working interesting jobs all the time though. At the end of the day, to me this means that it's MY responsibility to set boundaries and to walk away from people who don't respect them or that I'm incompatible with.

I _care_ about money though, at least currently. I like being provided for. I like the safety. I also like to provide myself.

We just care if you have a job at all, and especially what debt you might bring. I got lucky. My wife only had two kids and 18k in student debt. Some of my friends have horror stories there, discovered after they got married.  

I don’t know why women believe we care about their income. We truly do not. Like not at all. It’s not a selling point unless you’re a guy looking to use someone. Most of us aren’t that kind of scam artist, and despise the guys who are.  

Well, we do care a little if you make a lot more than us. You’re told it’s because it threatens our masculinity. Ummm, no. It’s that we pay attention to statistics, and relationship outcomes are terrible when this is the case.  

In my own experience, when I didn’t have the 6 figure salary I now enjoy, GFs who made more would constantly hound me to get a better job, and try to hook me up with work/careers I didn’t want and didn’t ask for. For context, I made around 60k as a high end bartender in the late 90s when this was happening. I wasn’t poor at all, and was 100% debt free. It was cringey AF, and I’d eventually leave.

She thought/talked about marriage, emotional fulfillment, raising a family together. 

He was nodding & secretly hoping she’d change her mind about kids, or he’d be able to keep HIS day to day lifestyle unchanged while SHE worked for a paycheck AND did all the work/parenting at home. 

Wish there was just a magic “Man-Child detector program”. Men who wanted to date would take a test of some sort, the “I just want a housekeeper, regular low-demand sex life and to be able to spend the rest of my time gaming w/ friends” detector would go “BING!” and the guy would recieve an invitation to “Bachelor Mansion”- a full-service apartment building with cleaning/a food service elevator from a first floor full of small restaurants, and free reserved parking for Sex workers to easily visit clients.

if823k3,t1_if7e09r,2022-07-07 16:17:47,TwoXChromosomes,"Burden is definitely not the word for it but I definitely consider it rude for people to make obviously negative or assumptive comments about other people (regardless of the topic). My point, albeit maybe poorly worded, was that money is a topic which often draws out these kind of negative comments so I can see why some people would avoid sharing their financial information. And not only if you have “too much” of it, but it also goes the other way to what is perceived as “too little” of it, that just wasn’t what was being discussed here. 

Again I think the way you’ve interpreted how I view our situation compared to others now may be down to poor wording (I struggle to get my point across without writing essays and that already felt long). I was not trying to say that our way was the “smart” way, I listed the negatives of our area to try to show that there is a trade off to living in our area which is what others seem to not take into account when they then comment on their view of our financial situation which therefore means they falsely assume we are in a better economic position than we are and then make negative comments/assumptions based on that. The other side of our city is 100% a nicer area and there is a reason it’s more expensive. The only reason I know what houses in their area cost is because we wanted to get somewhere there ourselves but couldn’t get what we wanted for our budget so we compromised on area. There are no black and white “smart” choices in house buying. Our house wouldn’t suit their needs/wants or they would have bought here and vice versa. My point was that we aren’t different because if it did suit their needs then they would have the choice to be here within roughly the same budget as their current property yet they assume that’s not the case and can be snide about it. Our “smart” choice would have been to just stay in our old house with half the mortgage and not moved but it didn’t suit our long term wants from a house.

Honestly? I know I have a hang up on this, it’s actually the reason I commented to raise the point that some people do and that’s not inherently a red flag if his job would be something that would advertise his financial status. It’s 100% a first world problem, I know that people with less would love the “it annoys me when people judge me because they think I have more than them”, I’m under no illusions on the fact my upbringing was privileged.

ifd28q6,t1_if8pf95,2022-07-08 16:32:29,TwoXChromosomes,">If it's private or men have any inkling that it will negatively affect how the early dates will play out, they may not share that about themselves.

Yes however it's normal and rational to accept that because of the choice to withhold there may not be any later dates. It's also normal and rational to accept that if a man chooses to reveal to an early date that he is wary of gold diggers, a woman might reject him on that basis. On the same grounds, when women choose not to reveal their phone number, place of work, etc. out of safety concerns on early dates, the man may choose to nope out, and she must accept that. Society at large may spread awareness and urge men to accept this safety issue on a basis of decency, but it's still obviously a man's choice to decide not to date her if she isn't forthcoming.

My reasoning for posting the original comment about job preference is that many women feel pressured to abide by some sort of ""equal fair opportunity"" code, as if they're the Housing Administration or some other public resource instead of a person on a date. Lots of women are shamed in particular for having preferences in their prospective SO's job, on the basis of being afraid of falling into the ""gold digger"" stereotype. I think women need not worry about that, as they have nothing to prove to anyone.",La_danse_banana_slug,t2_11a050,2,0,reddit1

If you ask someone what they want from an ideal relationship, or what their end goal is from dating, then you shouldn’t get a wishy washy answer — people should have a goal, even if that goal is just to date around, and you can then see if that goal matches yours.  So wording it to make clear that it’s a general question is important.

But if they think you’re asking what they want from a relationship with you, at a point where they don’t even know you, then saying something like “I want to get married and have like 50 kids,” or even “I want a long term relationship,” may come off as too much too fast.

If it makes you uncomfortable to be with someone who isn't willing to talk (which OP didn't said it made her) you can always walk away or not have a second date.

""I know you don't think it's a show. I don't doubt your emotions are real...""

The childish yet genuine emotions that drive abusive men to idealize every other woman they see are the very same emotions that encourage love-bombing.

if7acg4,t1_if71ckr,2022-07-07 13:02:16,TwoXChromosomes,"The problem with miscommunication is that the two people usually don't know they're not communicating.  So if you ask a question that you intend to be general but *they think* is meant to be specific, they'll often answer the specific question that they heard and never even know that you actually meant something else.  If your response to that is declaring that the conversation is over,  they thus won't walk away thinking ""I should have clarified whether she meant the general or the specific"" -- instead they're left thinking ""ok, this person wanted me to say I'd marry her, and blocked me because I didn't know if I even liked her yet.""

Your other option for them is basically confrontation -- to upbraid you for asking an unanswerable question, which would thus flag the miscommunication for you.  And some people will respond that way.  But a lot of people just want to keep the peace, be polite, not offend the other person -- and so will try to give an answer even if in their heads they're thinking ""wow, pretty soon to be asking that.""

For me, I therefore think the better course is to recognize that ""let's just see how it goes"" is the answer people give to the specific question of what they want out of a relationship with you -- and to see that as a cue to clarify what you're asking.

As for Post RtW, I don't blame you at all and I'm sure many single women agree with ya as well. It's ironic because a lot of these conservative men are benefitting from casual relationships and now they've basically wholeheartedly backed the overturning of RtW (and likely and unfortunately the case for birth control and other cases) and now they'll be scratching their heads at why women aren't as keen to hook-up with a random guy at the club or bar or even start a casual relationship with them.

 1 a “traditional values” person who doesn’t mind giving up their job. This does exist, even among among physicians.  One of my friends growing up mom’s went to medical school/did residency/practiced for like 2 years then decided to just be a stay at home mom and have like 7 kids (Catholics). And she went to medical school in then late 80’s.

2 Money and education tend to correlate. Obviously there are exceptions- like a plumber can makes more than a PHD in Art History, but they tend to go hand in hand.
If they’re planning on pressuring their spouse to be a stay at home parent in the future and their wife makes less money, a man can easily say “daycare/nanny is so expensive, why don’t you just quit your job and stay home.” 
If your wife makes more than you, then you’re the candidate for that.

>The dating landscape is evolving. I had noticed the slow decline also. Geez, catfishing as a whole phenomenon, yikes!

Not sure how it is on your side but I was surprised how many tinder accounts are for low-key escorts or women looking for onlyfans subs or to sell nudes on snapchat. That was a big change for me and why I barely use it now. 

>My guess is that the goal is to force young women into earlier marriages, for the explicit purpose of providing free, stable, always-available sex to young men. And, inflate ""white births"" by forcing white women into white marriages. Ironically, it'll hit minority communities harder, but then, we needed a cheap labor class anyway. Just like the good ol' Dixie days! Praise, glory, hallelujah!

Yeah and they are conveniently forgetting that we now have an entire two-three generations of women born with these rights - its not like they are just going to turn into submissive sex-slaves that wanna marry early and pop-out babies just because abortion is now legal. It's like The Three Stooges type of logic where they don't think more than 1.5 steps forward and will end up getting bit in the ass for it.

He thought that women were just meant to be frustrated and disappointed in relationships, and that it was normal for her to complain. He didn't take her multiple attempts to get him to meet her halfway as anything more than venting and basically tuned everything out. So when there were finally consequences for his emotional neglect and unwillingness to be a true partner, he was completely flabbergasted.

Another perspective is this man's article about his wife leaving him because he left dishes on the counter (and how he realized too late the ""real reason""):

No discussion no explanation no justification no back-and-forth none of that

Closure is something he has to accept for himself. When he pretends to not understand why you're leaving, that is his emotional weaponized incompetence and him refusing closure, which are not your problems to solve.

Don't argue with him. Don't justify anything with him. Don't agree to be anywhere private with him. Just reiterate that you aren't changing your mind that this relationship isn't right for you, and that you won't be in touch except about dividing your assets. Keep it as short as possible and don't let him rope you into an argument or crazy-making loop. Let him know you will no longer respond to his attempts to reconcile. And mean it.

I strongly suggest you get a lawyer if you haven't already, and ask your lawyer to handle communication with him moving forward. You might think he will be ""nice"" about dividing assets, but this doesn't sound like someone you can trust.

Remember, he doesn't have to agree with your decision. He doesn't have to understand. You're doing him the courtesy of meeting to discuss things, but you've physically left, and him not understanding/agreeing/accepting etc. does not change that or oblige you to 'justify' your decision to him or to continue discussing it after your meeting.

Girl, DO NOT MEET WITH HIM. Even if it's in a public space. You're not obligated to do so. You've said so yourself the last time you left- he manipulated you into staying by bringing up your dogs. He will not stop trying to manipulate you. AND he continues to put the mental load on you by asking you to draft a contract agreeing to do whatever you ask of him (???). 

Not going to touch that last one because that's heckin' weird while continuing to ignore your wants, where your wants right now is to GTFO of this relationship.

katpgjg,t3_183putz,2023-11-26 11:56:10,TwoXChromosomes,"Hey lovely, first of all, well done! It can be incredibly hard to leave. You’ve done well!!

So, you should know that 69% of divorces are initiated by women and researchers and divorce lawyers suggest the most common reasons these women have are unsatisfied needs and dissatisfaction, with unequal unpaid and household labour playing a big part.

The men, on the other hand, are often “blind sided.” Something that is pretty surprising, considering how many times their soon-to-be-ex-wives communicated their needs. 

Women communicating their needs has been framed as “nagging” by society, which is just so frustrating. 

Especially since only 42% of men spend time on housework compared to 70% of women and women do 2/3 of unpaid labour globally. Men create, on average, seven hours of additional work for their female partners each week. And they tend to overreport the housework they do by 148%.

So… you are *not* alone in this. 

I am concerned though, because it sounds like he has used very manipulative, coercive methods to get you to stay when you’ve tried to leave in the past, and he’s using manipulative methods now. So I’m going to post the signs of emotional abuse below and I think you should take a look through them. 

If they seem familiar, I need you to be very careful. Make a Safety Plan before you meet with him again. Because emotionally abusive men can flip into physical abuse and worse when their partners try to leave them. 

A Safety Plan is a personalised, practical plan that can help you avoid hurtful situations and know the best way to react when things are going badly between you. This might be danger of increased verbal abuse, it might also be things flipping into physical abuse (towards you or your pets). 

This plan includes vital information tailored to your unique situation and will help you prepare for and respond to different scenarios, including telling friends and family about your situation and events as they happen, coping with emotions, and various resources suited to your individual circumstances. 

In your Safety Plan, include information for when you finalise leaving him. For instance, include a plan to gather up all important items prior to the split including identification, important documents, all medication, medical records, car permits, and personal items that are important to you and store them somewhere safe. This will help you navigate things when you are emotional and under duress. 
Here are some resources to help you: 

https://www.thehotline.org/plan-for-safety/create-your-personal-safety-plan/

https://www.1800respect.org.au/help-and-support/safety-planning/checklist

I think it might be best to meet only through lawyers or else to ensure it’s a safe, public place and you should take someone to support you. Minimise contact as much as possible. 

Be safe. Big hugs!!

Here are the signs of emotional abuse:

1) They are hyper-critical or judgmental towards you.

2) They ignore boundaries or invade your privacy.

3) They are possessive and/or controlling.

4) They are manipulative.

5) They often dismiss you and your feelings.

Here’s some more detailed things to look for:

Humiliation, negation and criticism - tactics that undermine self-esteem. 

Eg: insults like calling you stupid, derogatory nicknames / terms of endearment that highlight your weaknesses / things you’re sensitive about, won’t stop when asked; character assassination (eg: ‘you’re always xyz’) to you or you others about you; screaming, yelling and swearing to intimidate you; patronising and belittling you (eg: ‘I know this is beyond your ability to comprehend’); public embarrassment - picking fights, spilling your secrets or making fun of your shortcomings in public; insulting your appearance; belittling your accomplishments; putting down your interests (because they don’t want you to participate in activities without them); pushing your buttons - continuing to do the things that annoy/upset you even if you beg them to stop.

Control and Shame - tactics that manipulate you into doing what they want you to do, often by making you feel ashamed of your inadequacies. controlling everything you do. 

Eg: they may try to control you by making threats, monitoring your whereabouts, spying on you (physically, digitally, via others), gaslighting you (which can leave you questioning your own memory, not to mention your mental health and well-being), making all of the decisions, controlling your access to finances, emotional blackmailing (including frequently ‘testing’ you), lecturing you constantly (cataloguing every minor perceived error, monologues of all the ways you’ve fallen short, making it clear that you are beneath them), having frequent outbursts, feigning helplessness, unpredictability (creating a walking on eggshells effect), walking out (eg: of events, unexpectedly), stonewalling you during disagreements or conflicts.

Accusing, blaming, denial - creating a hierarchy with them on top and you on the bottom.

Eg: jealousy (eg: accusing you of cheating or flirting), guilt-tripping, unrealistic expectations (they expect you to do what they want, when they want you to do it. They think you should always prioritise their needs, do things according to their standards — and you absolutely shouldn’t hang out with your friends or family if there’s any chance they might need you), goading and blaming (goading you into being upset and then blaming you for your reaction), denying the abuse (and often flipping it into you), trivialising (eg: if you express your feelings about something they did, they accuse you of overreacting or misunderstanding the situation), blaming you for their problems, destroying and denying (they might destroy or damage important possessions, etc and then deny it or claim it was an accident). 

Emotional neglect and isolation - they will try to get you to prioritise their needs and neglect your own and they’ll also make an effort to isolate you from your support network, leaving you more dependent on them and less able to contextualise their behaviour.

Eg: dehumanising you (eg: intentionally look away when you’re talking or stare at something else when speaking to you in an effort to make you feel unimportant); keeping you from socialising; invalidating you (suggesting or stating that your your needs, boundaries, and desires don’t matter to them); trying to come between you and your family; using the silent treatment; withholding affection (refusing intimate contact if you offend them or refuse to do what they want you to do); shutting down communication; actively working to turn others against you (eg: undermining you and your mental health to others, making you seem unstable, turning you into the ‘bad guy’, etc); interrupting (your talk, your activities, etc. Forcing your attention on them); disputing your feelings (insisting you shouldn’t feel that way).

Me: “it’s important to me that we get a couples counselor because we need help navigating our marriage”
Her: “I’m really busy, this is just not a priority to me right now”
Me: “can we talk? I’m concerned about our lack of intimacy and it deserves a conversation”
Her: “Not right now, I have a bunch of things I’m dealing with that are my focus”

She literally never took my concerns seriously. Not once did she initiate a conversation about our relationship or express interest in working through our problems. When I told her I wanted a divorce, she burst into tears and said she wanted to work on things. 

Too little too late. It made me realize she would only ever respond to ultimatums because my actual needs weren’t important to her.

Now - it was not downright abusive and if it was, we both were culprits. We enabled each other in a bad way : /. One of the reasons I had a bad conscience to go...  And I kept returning. But one day he said something unforgivable (it wasn't him with a drug problem, _I_ was the one with the drug problem, because I was so against drugs... wtf.) I fought for years to get him to be clean and realized with a huge ACME hammer, that i had lost the battle.  By that time I was cleaning up my act (not drugs. Mental illness) and I realized how much... stronger I actually was and that this relationship was a big trigger and made everything worse.

When I broke it off after the drug comment, he did not believe me and just kept moping until I told him weeks later (we still lived together, separated rooms, i was home very rarely to escape the mope hole) - that i was falling in love with somebody else. THEN it was serious. Then he started begging, fighting for me, promising change.

I imposed a 6 months quiet no contact time (After we settled everything with the flat).
After 6 months, we exchanged some short text messages in which he completely lost it. He had the pathetic need to now be the one to break up with me, telling me he did not want any contact with such a rude person, who couldn't write ""hello name"" and ""good bye, name"" in their text messages. Now he had all the power!!!111

I am a big fan of these 6 months no talking. Enough time to quiet down some of the lingering feelings, the habits and really finding and grounding oneself.

To be frank, I had the help of a therapist during these times and without her, i probably would not have left the relationship. She never told me to break up!

Not sure how your partner is, but my ex used to fly off the handle when he heard something he didn't want to hear so my therapist recommended I write him a letter so I could state clearly that it's over without him cutting me off and getting angry. 

She said to write out the plan in the letter for splitting belongings and whatnot, get all my thoughts out on paper and leave it for him to read while I was out. I came back and he was angry and crying, but I said what I needed to say in the letter. It helped me get in and out of the house faster, and I just told him I'd be in touch to get my belongings. Personally, I am really glad I did it that way because it kept me from backing down and I didn't have to deal with his manipulative tactics while getting my point across.

It also feel like it is hard for him to let go, so it can go dirty and then it is better to let lawyer to handle it and avoid seeing him. Don't let him control you. 

Everything went smoothly when I had breakup, because either of us didn't want any drama. We have child to share, so maybe that was the reason why we avoided drama and made it really easy and we are still friends and both have new partners. I only hope best for her - and only if she is happy then she can make my son happy. We didn't need anyone else to handle our breakup. It wasn't easy for both of us, but we didn't make it any harder that it needs to be. 

I also know that every breakup is different and adults can behave like little children when there emotions take control. Sometimes I feel like do I have lack of emotions, because I think very rationally when emotions should take control, but I think it is only ""survival mechanism"" that can block emotions for awhile.

We all know exactly what you mean, but in case some casual readers nod along with this without including the obvious: There were consequences before. The consequence was the asking partner feeling neglected, carrying a big burden, but it was not a consequence he thought affected him and that's just horrible.

Recently somebody posted a snippet with the phrase ""Tolerable Level of Permanent Unhappiness"", which is something men see no problem in imposing this on their partner. If i knew my partner were unhappy in our relationship - even unhappy in his job, the place we live in, anything, i would care! I would do everything to change things in our life so that the reason for the unhappiness is mended.
(There are boundaries of course. If my partner were unhappy, because my boob size is not adequate or my body had changed after pregnancy and I personally would be ok with both of these things, he'd not be my partner.) 

There are times when our partners are in very stressful situations, cannot be attentive, have reached their emotional capacity. Of course this should not come at the expense of the family and needs open communication. But in good times and in bad times - there is a 'tolerable level of temporary stress' i think, that is fine and part of relationships. But not... permanent! and unhappiness!

And let him know anything other than business-related will go into the shredder.

I had to do this once, and it worked pretty well. In retrospect, I should have just given up the shared assets to make it quicker and cleaner, for closure. But I don't know if they own real estate or not—that's the hard one. They have to agree on what to do, or go to court, which is slow and expensive.

kas7bp5,t1_karlpgl,2023-11-26 02:18:31,TwoXChromosomes,">He is legally entitled to ""half"" 

Of the house? Maybe. He's entitled to whatever he can negotiate with you. Buying property unmarried in the US is a risk because only divorce laws really can deal with it properly. 

He is not legally entitled to half the dogs. That's not how it works, in any US state, outside of divorces in Alaska, Illinois, and California. He might be entitled to half the value of things you bought together, but that's dollars, not objects (or pets). 

Here's how it works out practically. He can't sue you for a dog, probably. Most states don't allow for replevin in small claims. He could sue for the value of one dog, a dollar amount. The judge might award him that money. The judge *might* (if the judge wants to be creative) order you to give him one dog. But that's pretty unlikely. As they say, ""don't take legal advice from your opponent."" Anything he says is suspect, he's not a lawyer (probably) and he's certainly not *your* lawyer. Don't listen to friends and family, or him, or for that matter me—I'm just a random voice on reddit. But I've dealt with these things many times in multiple states.

As for the house, if he and you can agree to sell it and split the proceeds 50/50, then that's one option. He might insist on 60/40. Then you might have to accept less for closure, or wait him out. Or he may want to but you our of your share for less than 50% (if he even has the credit to refinance—and interest rates are much higher now anyway). So a sale is the only practical thing probably. If you can't agree, then you have to hire lawyers and go to court for a partition sale. Which is slow and expensive. Then you'd presumably split the proceeds 50/50 but they'd be much less than if you agreed. (He could argue he put more money into the house and try to get more than half, but he'd have to actually prove that.)

kassx1u,t1_karlpgl,2023-11-26 05:11:02,TwoXChromosomes,"You're not married. He's legally entitled to half the house because you both bought the house, and the contents of the house are complicated because they're generally assumed to be part of the property, so they have to be divided up in some fashion. The dogs aren't part of that. Just like your car, or your bike, or your computer or phone aren't part of that. 

If you have proof that the dogs are microchipped in your name, that you've been paying for their food, been feeding them, taking them to the vet and paying for bills, etc. then that'll cover most disputes. The other thing to understand is that even if you just take the dogs, the police are not going to force you to give the dogs back. They'll call it a civil dispute and tell your ex to take you to court.

And if your ex does take you to court, it will be small claims. No lawyer needed. And unless he's smart enough to sue specifically for the *return* of the dogs (replevin), and not the *monetary value* of the dogs, all you'll have to pay him is the value of the dogs. Unless you've got some expensive pedigree dogs, you'll probably wind up paying like sixty bucks apiece for them or whatever the going rate is at your local county shelter. 

Just keep the dogs. Go to the vet and make sure they're chipped in your name. Make sure your name and phone number is the default contact for the veterinary clinic you use. Collect all evidence and paperwork that shows you're the primary caretaker for them. And just make sure not to leave them unsupervised in your yard where someone can come by and snatch them.

I'm not a lawyer, I've just seen this play out often enough to have some useful advice. Animals are regarded as property, but they're a kind of property that's notoriously difficult to get returned through legal channels. So to put it simply, just make sure that he never gets his hands on them, in any capacity. Don't let him see them, don't let him say goodbye to them, etc. because that just gives him the opportunity to take them by force. He'll find that it's ridiculously, *painfully* hard to get law enforcement and legal channels to do anything useful regarding a stolen pet, especially if it's a case where the right answer to the dispute is not clear. Most people get their stolen pets back by literally stealing them back because that's how useless the legal channels are.

Yes, but people often ask the wrong questions about their relationships. For example, someone being abused might ask how they learn not to be bothered by the abuse, which is the wrong question. The right question here is how to most peacefully move forward, and his opinion on the relationship is not required for that because the relationship is over.

OP is probably never going to get him to agree to the breakup because he doesn't want it, so she shouldn't waste her time and energy on a futile endeavor. The best thing she can do is accept with herself that she's doing the right thing and not worry about managing his feelings through the breakup.

Speaking as an Indian woman who was raised to ""respect"" elder Indian men. To refer to them as ""uncle"". To accept physical forms of affection from them no matter how much I didn't want to (hugs/kissed on the cheek etc.) You're right, it isn't acceptable. And we should not try to reason with their actions by wondering if it's because they come from a different background or are older. They should be held accountable regardless.

dtxri05,t3_7w4fg5,2018-02-08 16:52:19,TwoXChromosomes,"I just want to suggest to anyone reading ~~a good~~ one type of response in this situation that I read a few days ago from another thread. As a father, I know my daughter will one day have to deal with this sort of behavior and I really liked the suggestion, which was to loudly and publicly confront that person ON THE SPOT. Something along the lines of:

""Why did you just touch me ? I DID NOT give you permission to do this and this IS NOT appropriate. Do you think it is OK to sexually touch people without asking?"" 
This should achieve a few things: 

1. Publicly humiliate the offender, something that he is counting on not happening. 

2. It will prevent all the other people from pretending nothing happened just so that everyone's life is easier. 

3. It will set a positive example to all other normal people in that situation (especially women, since they are affected worst by this) it is OK to speak out and it is OK to be upset about it. 

4. It will make it harder for other people to step in and try and ""mollify"" the situation for the sake of not creating a scene (a scene is necessary in my opinion in this situation).

5. If someone does step up to try and defend the offender (you would be surprised) just ask them ""So you think it is OK/ It's a joke when people sexually touch others without asking for permission?""

I realize that in the shock of the moment it is hard to come up with something like this, but I think it is worth considering for those of you who might find themselves in this situation. I also know deep down that a lot of people would be too embarrassed, afraid to loose their job, want to avoid the confrontation, etc. to say anything and that makes me sad. 

OP I hope you have the courage to stand up for yourself and demand the dignity that you deserve as a human being. I wish you luck.

dtxxo1e,t3_7w4fg5,2018-02-08 18:19:31,TwoXChromosomes,"EDITING TO SAY THIS IS FROM A U.S. PERSPECTIVE (and not legal advice)

Given all of the advice below here is what I would do:

Set up a time to speak to your boss. Just say ""Do you have a few minutes to talk"" - try to set this up by email so you have an electronic record.

Record your meeting with video - not audio. There are laws (in the US) against audio recordings but not against video recording. Just put it in your pocket, the audio is the most important part.

Say this:  I am so happy the launch party went so well. What did you think of it?

LISTEN (should only take a minute).

But I did want to tell you - I was uncomfortable that you slapped my backside during it. I received a lot of awkward looks afterwards and just feel it was not appropriate.

KEEP YOUR VOICE CALM. No need for you to be nervous, this is you setting boundaries, not you setting him on fire. This is perfectly normal for a person to say. You are not doing anything wrong, your not confronting him, you're simply telling him it was not welcome.

LISTEN: He will apologize or explain.  

If he apologizes:  Thank him for his time and leave. When you get to your desk write an email thanking him for his time. Just like:  John, thanks again for taking the time to meet with me. I'm glad we were able to talk this out. YOUR NAME

Send all these emails and the recording to your home email.  Keep in case you need it.

IF HE GOES OFF AND SAYS YOU SHOULD LIKE IT OR WHATEVER. Listen to him, do not engage. When done, let him know you would like to take the remainder of the day off and leave the office.  Hire an attorney and you will have the content you need to get reimbursed for this activity.

Keep calm. Try to pretend you are giving me this advice, vs the one in the moment. Stay calm and logical. In the US, you legit cannot accuse a boss or anyone of sexual harassment unless you TELL THEM NO. Otherwise HR says ""how were they supposed to know it bothered you"" So this is you saying no, calmly and nicely. And any actions after that gives you a case.",mediawoman,t2_3dnya,5,0,reddit3

If he is a boss worth working for he will apologize and try to make amends. If not, then all the more reason to leave the job and all the bigger a case you have for sexual harassment.

Also India is very sexually repressed, women might find it offensive and might make a scene if you just sit next to them on public transport (most have reserved seats) or even look at them wrong. Touching a woman even casually is frowned upon, if the woman makes a scene the guy would get trashed by a mob.

But many Indian men  do have the notion that the West is way more liberal (they have a very warped notion of sexual liberalism) and think they can get away with creepy stuff abroad.

Document everything, and ask anyone who is willing ti support you to write a brief statements - even informally - indicating they saw it happen. Then go and speak to him, beginning by telling him that the incident where he slapped your backside was inappropriate, regardless of setting, and that you would like to speak to him about it. Ideally, he admits it was wrong, possibly explains why it happened (he may have been drunk or high, who knows), and then you can decide what you want to do next. Write down the conversation as near as you can remember it, and if there is any reprisal, you will it have it well documented that he initiated inappropriate action, and it will be clear that the reprisal is over this matter.

I use to run a pizza store, and I had a 40 year old Egyptian Muslim who worked for me. He'd never worked for a women before and it was hard for him to get use to. Let me clarify first off, that he was *never* disrespectful. If anything, he was over protective and extremely respectful. He was hands down one of the best people I've ever known. But there was certainly a cultural issue between us. We butt heads a little at first until we sat down and talked it out. 

He would do funny things like ask why I wasn't married. And at first, that seems so insulting. ""Why you no married? Your amazing, I'd marry you!"" And that seems weird at first, right? Well I talked to him and he explained it better. In his culture the highest honor you can give a woman is marriage. Your putting her in charge of your household and life, and, in his view, worshiping her as a wife should be. (of course there's still some huge gender inequality and oppression of women, but this guy is literally the nicest person ever). So for my then bf to not marry me was a huge insult. And he meant it as a compliment to me. That I was marriage material meant I was good at math, I would be a good mother, and that I was entertaining and smart. But to us girls, asking us that was mind blowing. 

Then my bff started working there, and she has a ton of tattoos. Hafiz really liked her as a person, and he would question her tattoos all the time. ""Zift,"" he'd say, ""It's zift, it's tabboo, why you hurt yourself like that?"". Finally I told him to ask her, because he'd be surprised. We ended up having a really great discussion with him about tattoos being art, where the line was, and so much more. We learned about Egyptian and Muslim culture in comparison to tattoos and in the end, Hafiz said he ""learned something beautiful"". 

My point, is that sometimes age or different cultures cause miscommunication. And conversation always helps. Now, if I were you, I would mention it to one of the sons. Not in a ""I'm filing a complaint"" sort of way, but a ""this made me uncomfortable"" way. Make it clear that it happening isn't an issue (although it is), but it becoming the norm is the issue. 

Hafiz use to call all the guys his brothers. By the time I left that store, he called me his sister and I was his only one. It was hard for him to rewrite 40 years of normal for him, but even old dogs can learn new tricks if people are willing to communicate.",MercuryMadHatter,t2_iolf6,1,0,reddit3

Document it all very well. After all, you have witnesses, and document the conversation you have with him. 

It if goes badly, then you have a record and can then seek legal means.  The fact that you have witnesses helps you, And the fact that you addressed it directly with him will help was well.

First, I think you should start looking for a new job. Then I think you should inform your managers and owner that you're looking for a new job and why. I think you should be straight forward with them and say that you can't let a person, no matter who they are, feel they have access to your body in such a way.

I think you should also remind them that you're a good employee and that you expect raving testimonials and written references with your stellar performance in this company while you interview and consider other employment in the industry.

I also would remind them that it is fair that in return you will not mention this company's name or owners in any negative way in the future in order to keep their company growing and thriving without a media outing and parade of female protestors at the front door of their stores.

I think you have to stand up, tell them they are wrong, inform them two wrongs won't make a right, and that you'd appreciate their support while you move on to a more appropriate environment while they review their own harassment policies, and maybe the law as well. 

Like I said, it's just an opinion on how to handle this. If you think they are going to tell you to go fuck yourself then just post it on FB and a bunch women will go and have that fight for you in front of the stores. See how they like that kind of publicity.

There are many ways to deal with problems like this and to me I think the best way is one that wouldn’t drag out the problem and end up stressing you out. You can probably bring up the fact that since he came from a different cultural background he might not understand some of these differences. Use this as the starting point to talk how its not acceptable to do that sort of thing. 

I experienced a few of these situations myself as I was deemed disrespectful by my exgf’s traditional parents. Customarily “Hi Mr./Mrs.” was not enough for a proper Asian greeting. They were a expecting a bow or head nod but I gave them a handshake instead. Strike 1. When dinner was served there was plenty to eat and it included soup. I tried to eat as carefully as I could (in my head I was just trying to leave a good impression and I thought careful eating was respectful) — I ate as gracefully as I could without a single noise. Strike 2. Traditional family dinners includes sipping soup (with sound) and eating with moderate clanging of utensils because it shows a lively delicious meal to the host. The biggest strike of all was when her parents found out that I was going to be staying over for the night... in her room... Strike 3. 

Sorry I went off on a tangent, the point is, I’ve seen where if you discuss and talk it over with the person, who sometimes are unaware of the problem,  it smooths things out a lot better.

That is not your first step.

Your first step is to negate the humiliation that you felt.  Consider why you felt humiliated?  You not only did nothing wrong, you actually did *nothing*.

The reason you felt humiliated not because of what happened, but because our society teaches women that *we* are responsible for the actions of everyone around us. 

Husband goes to work wearing the wrong tie? It's your fault.
Boyfriend hit you? You must have done something wrong.
Get raped? You must have done something to encourage the guy.

So, first you have to completely reject the idea that you have any intelligent reason to feel humiliated - that the only reasons for that feeling was that you have been trained that way and it's time to reject that training. 

What you should feel is anger - that someone touched you without your consent and with an overtly sexual manner. That is a very intelligent reason to get angry.  (BTW, women are also taught that they aren't supposed to get angry) 

So practice this - think about what happened, and if you feel humiliated about it, tell your lizard brain that you aren't responsible for his behavior. That what he did was wrong, and he's the one who should be embarrassed. And that you have the right to be angry about it.",zyada_tx,t2_buwgb5,1,0,reddit3

What would be the best outcome for you at this point?

Is he normally a decent boss or is he always a shit biscuit?

If he is basically a good guy. Married respectable etc I would consider setting up a meeting him with him and face to face hashing out the incident. You have legal avenues to pursue, and there were enough witnesses' ss that someone would talk. He's got to know that so he may be more than receptive to whatever your demands might be.

If you do this and he does not react in a positive manner call a lawyer tell them the incident and go from there. At that point, your locality is what makes a difference in how you proceed.

You are right to be angry, but do not waste it. Figure out what you need to feel better and go after that with professionalism.

If you do not get satisfaction in a speedy manner speak to a lawyer. He may or may not be worth taking on but it would behoove you to know before you decide whether or not to call the police.

There may have been alcohol involved, and you're right, culture/age may play a factor.

dtyfrda,t3_7w4fg5,2018-02-08 22:48:24,TwoXChromosomes,"Well after working for a stint as a CNA in a nursing home I'd seen that one of the things that can begin to happen to brains is they lose the ability to filter behavior/words, at least in the context of degenerative aging diseases, so that is definitely something to consider. But let's assume he doesn't have a degenerative brain disease.

OK, now for the hard part. (at least if you have a non-confrontational disposition like me)

You are going to need to confront him about it and be clear about how you feel. Stand up for yourself! Most people would hesitate to agree, but the slap on the ass in the end is not a big deal. I'm sure your ass is fine as is mine. The big deal is after something like this happens how you handle yourself and communicate how you feel about a behavior that crossed your personal boundaries. If you hold it in and allow more behavior like this, you will feel shitty for not standing up for yourself earlier and there is where the problem lies. My view is that our society doesn't need an old man thrown in jail for a slap on the ass, we need women (people) who will stand up for themselves. And this is not just about 'sexual' situations, this is everywhere in your life. And this is also about a search for empathy and understanding with others, but especially yourself. It's HARD to stand up for yourself and do all these right things to do especially in your position and being so young, so be patient with yourself if it takes some time. Also try to be empathetic and understanding with your boss as weird as it may sound. Our society wants us to hate people like this, but that just is not good for anyone in the situation. As a holder of stoic philosophy I am always looking for the best result out of my own actions because I can't change the creepy old man and never will be able to, but I can change myself. Personally finding empathy and understanding with the 'abuser' is the most healing thing I have ever done for myself. The idea that these are just hurt people that are following a shorter wavelength that likely riddled with their own anxiety from past abuse themselves,is a lot easier to swallow to me than seeing the world as filled with these horrible monsters. Jesus, the ultimate stoic said it best, ""Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."" Now I'm not saying the earth is 6000 years old, but if you want to be free from that cycle of spite go ahead and choose empathy and understanding and do it for yourself. Mind you as well that all this can certainly coexist with also not condoning the behavior itself.

Now that being said, if after you make it clear you don't ever want to be touched like that again and something else happens, then it's a big deal for him and I would not hesitate to take further action including the law. 

Also if you want a script on what to say, here is what I would say. 

""Sir I don't know if you remember the party the other day, but if you recall while you were joking around you had slapped my ass and I felt very uncomfortable with it and wished I was not touched in that manner. That being said I'm not here to talk about what happened, I just wanted to be clear with you that that would not happen in the future because I really do love working here as a professional for your company."" 

Just anything along those lines being sure to not attack him for the past, but to assert yourself and communicate what needs to happen in the future. It is always best to focus on what to do rather than what not to do. As a lifeguard I would always tell kids please walk, rather than say no running. One is more indirect while trying to act as a command, the other simply says EXACTLY what to do. People will even appreciate when you are more direct rather than passive aggressive, even if it might seem weird to you at first. Also something hugely important for me to always remember is that if you believe in what you say and always seek the truth you have nothing to fear from sharing anything you have to say. And it just so happens that other people will will believe you too! As long as you show that you have an open mind filled with empathy and understanding that bows only to the truth as best as you can see it you will be amazed at how much clearer the world will be to you. I would even be willing to bet money that your boss would have a hard time even trying that again because there is no longer the same fog of communication between you. So basically just believe in your own logic and understanding, believe your ideas will be understood by others and that your own communication will more than likely be met in turn. All this believing comes down to really knowing though, because you can't simply believe something in your heart unless you know it to be true. Which is where ""they know not what they do"" again comes into play. Once they know, the game changes. This is why communication has to be the centerpiece of our strategy along with your own knowlege and with it the confidence that then comes into play by your side. Once you can effectively share this with others you will become very powerful in your belief and as long as you keep the idea of truth as your sole guiding principle good things will come to you.

Anyway this is all just the opinion of a 28 year old male who himself dealt with unwanted sexual behavior during period of homelessness in my younger days caused by abandonment issues that resulted in substance abuse. I chose at the time to stay quiet, especially with myself and what I believed. Sure my housing depended on it, so I can definitely empathize with the pressures you face there, but with hindsight all that was never the issue. I was the issue. Not either that it was my fault, but I didn't know what I was doing at the time. Though such is life. Live and learn! That being said, I stand by all my suggestions and hopefully this is something you can transform into something to grow from. You got this.",Gold3n1,t2_14fxp9,1,0,reddit3

You need to, as soon as possible, reset your boss/employee relationship to pre-slap. A direct hand written letter to him would be  a great way to do this.

It's YOUR body he's violated, nobody else's. If you aren't planning to lawyer up to sue him into oblivion already, I may avoid having a direct discussion about it beforehand. This may give him an opportunity to have you accept any apology he may offer, which may weaken your position in the future if you decide to follow through with a suit or claim. If you do decide to talk to him, I would be careful; of course don't mention that you're thinking of a lawsuit yet, wait and get all of your information before you proceed. But if you feel the need to talk to him, I would seriously consider whether or not you should accept his apology. It kind of sucks and seems cold and inhumane, but so is the law, and so were his actions.

He's a 64 year old man who runs a clothing company. He has to understand, regardless of where he is from, you CAN NOT TOUCH YOUR EMPLOYEES LIKE THIS. And yes, if you felt violated, embarassed, etc. it IS a huge deal. The power dynamics at play here are very serious, and depending on the kind of person he is, he may see this as a pass to start treating you or others similarly or worse.

Whatever you decide to do, please do not let him just slide. I understand you may be putting your job at risk, but see if there are any protections you can file for before taking the appropriate steps to handle the situation. It sounds like you'd need to go entirely outside the company for this. Be careful, but please understand how much power you have in this situation now. The ball is in your court.

EDIT: Clarity/grammar

EDIT: I just want to clarify that if she deems the situation to be not so important as to follow through with legal action, that is absolutely fine and her decision to make. I simply feel that as the head of a company or organization his conduct should be held to a high standard. A lack of foresight or understanding on his part in the situation should not mean that she shouldn't prepare for a more serious situation - that he doesn't care about his conduct and she may need to move to protect herself instead of further extending the olive branch.",JiggyWopWop,t2_knqz5,-11,0,reddit3

If you really care and want to keep your job, going the 'lawyer' route is a bad idea as it might get you some compensation for what he did but you'd have a BAD relation to your employer and as such difficulties trying to get a raise or other bonuses. It will also make you feel unhappy with your job when you feel like your relation with the boss is very poor.

I had an incident with my boss and his 'bad' behavoir, not in anyway sexual like this, I am also a guy.

If your employer does not respect you, you will not enjoy the workplace.

This is what I would do:

1. Confront him and talk about it, put down your foot and say where you stand.

2. If he respects you and gives you a sincery apology, he shows that he values you at their company and how you are a great asset to them.

Tell him you love your job and are thankful for the opportunities he's given you;

Point out that when he slapped your ass, he reduced you from a respected employee and team member to a sex object. He may see this as ""good fun"", but in the culture your business operates in, it's damaging to your reputation and respectability as an effective team member.

Point out that powerful men are losing their careers over this behavior (without sounding threatening). That incidents like this, in western culture, are now a very big flash point, and any competitor can use things like this to damage the business he's built.

Tell him you'd be glad to discuss it personally and you believe that coming up with company guidelines for this behavior will strengthen the business and help with employee retention, and protect his work from lawsuits and reputation damage. Volunteer to help develop company guidelines that protect all employees and protect the business itself. 

If he's an overall ""good"" person who made a cultural mistake, it may position you as someone with untapped skills and cultural knowledge that can help grow the business an insure its long-term viability. 

I know there's plenty of anger in this thread, and deservedly so; maybe taking an understanding approach can bring some long-term good out of this. #MeToo is a powerful movement, but the attitude I suggest can often be more powerful than anger or vengeance, as far as effecting change goes.

Moreover, any expression of hot anger (such as a raised voice or  violence) can be seen by them as a win. Whenever a person touches you sexually (without your consent). they are initiating a power struggle, and any overtly angry reaction will show that they were able to make you lose control.

What you want to do is express your anger coldly. 
Turn to face the person. Bring yourself to your full height. Lift your chin. Look them straight in the eye. (If they were touching you, this is when you would remove their hand. Brush it off like a fly, or lift it off like a piece of dirt)  Raise an eyebrow.

Turn round so you are completely square on to him. Stare at him straight in the eyes and, slightly louder than is comfortable for the environment say,

""Don't EVER do that to me again.""

And continue to stare at him. If he laughs or belittles you. Walk away and yes, lawyer up and get names of the people there (if there are). If he says nothing, count three seconds in your head while staring at him, then turn away and continue doing what you were before like nothing happened.

The right thing to do in the situation, if there is one, is to slap him on the face and/or tell him no immediately.

Touching someone without their consent is not a minor incident. If he did it to her, what is to stop him from doing it to someone else? If she comes forward, it may inspire others to report behavior like this that they have experienced. 

Being a ""sweetheart"" 99.9% of the time does not excuse someone from touching someone else without their consent. Especially in public and especially when one person holds power over the other. He did not innocently smack her on her buttocks. He did it in a public setting and caused her embarrassment in front of colleagues, vendors, clients, and other guests. Even if he intended it to be playful he did not take into account how she would react or if it was even welcome. 

Being drunk is never an excuse for this type of behavior. Alcohol does not give someone immunity from their actions. 

I do not know what happened because I was not there. I am relying on her version of events. He did not express any remorse for the behavior. 

She should speak with an employment attorney to see how she should handle the situation going forward. If she immediately goes to HR they could retaliate against her. She needs to have someone on her side and HR is not always on the employee's side. 

I am not ""fucking insane."" I work in HR and I have been the victim of sexual harassment.

YOU know nothing of the context, and YOU know nothing of the people involved.

What if the guy is an absolute sweetheart of an old man 100% of the time? TOO FUCKING BAD. Don't TOUCH people without ASKING.

Was alcohol involved? Doesn't fucking matter. Alcohol is never an excuse for poor decisions, because they made the decision beforehand to drink it. If they're 64 and don't know if they can handle their liquor/not keep their hands to themselves, that's nobody's fault but their own.

How he did it? Apparently with some gusto and in a room of co-workers and customers. That's all the context we need. It happened.

No, we don't know anything other than what OP told us.

Maybe she shouldn't immediately threaten a lawsuit (for a variety of reasons), but saying it is completely off of the table is unrealistic and enabling of these types of behaviors.

Also, I do not understand how the fuck you can possibly think that someone who is figuratively backed into a corner (it's her boss, no HR protection, has a chance of losing her job/stability of she complains) and is seeking options for retribution could be seen as more morally reprehensible than a boss SLAPPING HIS 21 YEAR OLD EMPLOYEE ON THE ASS. In PUBLIC. In front of their staff and employees.

Here's an idea.

Intentions do matter.  They always matter.  They actually matter in the court of law as well.  As an example, there is a striking difference between intentional murder vs unintentional manslaughter.

The OP is trying to come up with a reaction to an event that occurred which made her uncomfortable.  Since when is it not appropriate to consider the exact situation, the intentions of the individual, the prior behavior of the individual, and the severity of the action in question?

Is there not a difference between a man in his 40's who acts inappropriately on a regular basis and makes lewd comments vs an older gentleman in his 60's who is sweet as can be?  Is there not a difference between a man in his 40's with a pattern of poor behavior smacking her ass loudly in public vs an older man who has never been anything but nice smacking her bum lightly while making what he thought (wrongly) was a flattering comment/joke?

She is trying to consider how she should react to something that occurred.  Advising her to reach for a nuke (legal threat) without knowing more about the situation, the person involved, and the event details is irresponsible, hypocritical, and wrong.

As an additional point, I will note that the man in question is in his mid to late 60's.  You comment that he is in his 40's.  Just that fact alone can potentially change the entire situation around and potentially alter her reaction.",willswim4pizza,t2_nkbfx,-6,0,reddit3
dtxpbdy,t1_dtxogad,2018-02-08 16:18:48,TwoXChromosomes,"See - you are actually shifting the argument to sound correct.

There are two things to discuss here:

1)  His action.

2)  His intentions.

Actions are a fact.  It occurred.  It was not appropriate.  The end.

His intentions COULD have been innocent.  His intentions likely were not meant to cause any discomfort.  Intentions are important.

So you can sit here and say I'm part of the problem all you want, but I am not.  I understand clearly what is appropriate and what is not in the work place.  I also understand that you cannot judge a person on one action that, while wrong, may have been done with good intentions.

If everyone judged people without reservation on nothing but their actions then we would live in a pretty shitty world.  You know why?  Because everyone makes mistakes.  Everyone acts inappropriately at times.  Everyone has regrets.

How would you like it if you were judged so harshly purely on your actions?  What happens the next time you're in the office and you have to leave 5 minutes before work ends?  What happens if you're in the office and are innocently gossiping about someone inappropriately?  What happens the next time you take a personal call in the office?  If you were judged purely on your actions you'd be written up or terminated for everything I just listed.

So stop being so damn caustic and hostile towards people.  Give them a chance.  Stop giving out such insane advice to girls asking for help in this situation.  Give real advice.  Telling a girl to go speak to a lawyer based on the limited information she gave us is actual insanity, would likely result in the lawyer laughing at her, and if it proceeded would almost surely result in her losing her job without receiving any form of legal victory.",willswim4pizza,t2_nkbfx,-4,0,reddit3

Yeah, of Indian descent. In my experience, and among my friends as well, older Indian men rarely talk about sex or even make sexually inappropriate jokes.

I often find that ""punish them to the full extent of the law people"" often have absolutely no clue what the law in fact is regarding the issue they speak of.

The most this ""could"" be is harassment, and only if it produced an injury or a hostile environment.

This blatant misunderstanding of the law is why the overwhelming majority of sexual harassment cases are dismissed with the statement ""no injury occurred, you were just offended, that is not an injury.""

Another thing they often do is falsely substitute company policy on what the company will allow (to stay far clear of lawsuits) as what the law is in court. This is invalid.

Sometimes it feels safer to stay quiet and sometimes it is safer. Unfortunately this is not typically a one-off behavior and someone who sexually harasses once is likely to abuse their power again in the future. Let’s be clear, sexual harassment and sexual assault are power moves.     
    
The laws need to be updated to our time now. With the advent of the #MeToo movement I hope people are inspired to create grassroots legislation to inform our future policies on sexual assault and harassment.   
    
I worked on a Rape Crisis Hotline for a few years and that really helped. It made me feel like I was being there for people like I needed someone back then.     
   
There is supposed to be an advocate with the survivor at all times during the rape kit and police interview, but sometimes cops don’t let the advocate in. Asking those questions and taking yourself back to the rape/assault that just happened can be really retraumatizing. Speaking to the cops isn’t compulsory though and a lot of people don’t file reports with cops for a multitude of reasons. A prior police record for sex work, immigration status, etc. there are a lot of reasons people are afraid to report. The sex crimes dept won’t arrest or deport either of those two if they aren’t a corrupt dept. That is to say, they are supposed to look for the perpetrator of the sexual assault not try to punish the survivor. This may not prevent beat cops and others from being corrupt and doing horrible things to them. The worst of the worst is when the perpetrator of the sexual assault is a cop. Unstable power figures are terrifying.

What is your point. The law harshly punishes those who penetrate with a penis in a vagina, but it decreases from there. I shouldn’t have to say that a spank is sexual assault just like I shouldn’t have to explain that a spank wouldn’t be charged as harshly as rape. This is called sexual harassment, but it’s under the umbrella of the term “sexual assault.”        
    
No shit. That was the point of my previous comment. The police charge based on PENETRATION for sexual assault. So implicitly this scenario with just a spank on the ass won’t be charged as a sexual assault or as harshly according to the law. I’m sure you’re a reddit lawyer, but a previous SF DA gave us a presentation along with the Lieutenant of sex crimes and a govt victim advocate. I know what I’m talking about.           
    
The law is flawed and needs a serious overhaul. You need to realize people are allowed to stand up for themselves when their body was violated. No one should have to ask their boss not to spank them. It’s supposed to be common sense not to sexually harass anyone. Employees should never have the onus on them to establish sexual harassment boundaries with their employers.

His attitude, or his intent, means absolutely nothing. His actions, and how his actions made the violated party feel, are what matters. He wasn't the one who had his ass slapped in a room full of people by his boss.

Nobody is perfect, and yes, mistakes do happen to the best of us. Some lapses in judgment are more serious than others, and should be dealt with appropriately. Driving drunk is a very serious lapse in judgment, but does anyone ever mention to consider the attitude of the drunk driver? Not that I've known. They are putting themselves and others at risk of damage or death, their mental state (grief, anger, loss of sanity, etc.) is completely secondary to the action of drunk driving.

Now, I'm not trying to say that sexual assault should carry the same weight as endangering lives with drunk driving by any means, but clearly a decision was made by him to violate the body of one of his employees at a company function. His intent is irrelevant.

We noticed it happening but then girl complained about it when he tried to stop her to talk to her. We knew we had to take action. Few of us grabbed the guy when he was on our street and then we proceeded to twist his hair around our fingers and rip it off his scalp. This was all done in the presence of a Police Inspector of our police station. We sent the guy to the ER on a rickshaw but not before we got his address from him. I have to this date, not regretted my action once and would gladly go to court if he dared to press charges. It has been years and we've crossed paths many times since. He's kind of talked about as an example. So yes, that person might well end up dead in the street. 

I've seen 2 guys get lynched because they slapped the breasts of a Caucasian woman (a tourist) and tried to scurry away in the crowd. The Caucasian woman started screaming and some people who saw it happen grabbed both the guys by the scruff of their necks. I've never felt so pleased about mob justice.

After having said all this, any reform, which is rooted in fear of violence is wrong and inherently flawed.

She should open a dialogue with him, but be very careful in what she says and is discussed.

You're right - swift and severe retribution is not always the proper thing, but she should absolutely not worry about what his intent was. His actions are what he needs to be held accountable for; his intent could become a lie to cover his true intentions. There's no way of actually knowing without being inside of his head, and thus, his intent does not matter.

I just feel she needs to be very careful with this, but not to worry about the damage it may cause the boss in the long run - especially  if after a conversation has been started and he's obviously not apologetic or regretting his actions.

""Guys are pervs"" does not excuse them to touch anyone, at any time, especially in a workplace. Those other guys you work with are also your co-workers, and retribution can be much swifter if you decided to take action with it. They're honestly lucky you're understanding of their behavior. That was your dynamic and your situation - hers was with her boss in a very public non-office setting with co-workers and staff in which he slapped her on the bum. While calling her a naughty girl. Your co-workers are not your boss, and your partner is certainly not your boss. Not trying to hand-wave your examples, but I feel the dynamics of those situations are very different.

While I agree she needs to open a dialogue and be sure of the action she needs to take, at no point should it be construed that she has any guaranteed job safety left after doing so. Depending on the type of person he is (he may NOT be a normal human being!), that conversation could be the beginning of the end of her career there. This is a perilous situation, mainly predicated by the fact that he can completely control her ability to work there. 

She needs to move forward carefully, but also understand that his intentions mean absolutely nothing in a context while he controls her financial stability via employment, due to the fact that if he does or did have ill intentions, he'd likely lie about them to retain his position. If he didn't have any ill intentions and it was just a ""dumb mistake"", he'd probably fudge the truth or blame it on something else to deny culpability.

I don't see what the boss would have to gain from -not- lying to her. Thus, determining his intent is irrelevent IMO, only what she chooses to do about his action is. If that involves opening a dialogue, great - but she should know that means that if he's not a ""normal"" human being and is in fact duplicitous, that may be the beginning of the end for her time working there.

An example is people posting maps of IQ scores from around the world and saying ""See?? Europeans have higher IQs than Africans!! I'm not saying anything, I'm just stating facts!! Ooooh so are facts racist now????""

The truth is that ""I'm just stating facts"" has unfortunately become a dog whistle, and your comment only proves my point. The moment I read it, I knew exactly what I'd find in your post history, which is defending and expressing support for people defending Trump's racist ass comments regarding Mexicans and other immigrants, bending over backwards to argue that they're totally not racist. Anyone with half a brain and half a heart has already seen and heard enough from him to know what he believes. He's said so many racist things that it's not even up for debate at this point. 

People don't feel comfortable openly stating that they hold racist beliefs anymore, so they hide behind what they call ""facts"". But facts aren't facts if they're stripped of context and used to imply things that are not factual at all.

dtxsnmm,t1_dtxrxv6,2018-02-08 17:09:27,TwoXChromosomes,"So yeah, it's never really a good idea to be so drunk you can't think straight. When you make a bad decision that can affect yourself like that, it is horrible, but the law exists to protect victims from people who may prey on their vulnerable situation. This is fine.

What is not fine is drinking to the point of stupidity where you decide to sexually harass your employees. If he chose to drink, then yes, he is still responsible for his actions. If he doesn't know his limits before he becomes inappropriate to be around others, that is his fault and nobody else's. 

Alcohol, in this context, does not excuse his behavior. It does, however, excuse the behavior of someone who is assaulted or raped - they are not the ones PERFORMING the assault or rape, their decision making is severely impaired by the alcohol. The onus of the action lies on the person who takes advantage of the drunk person.

In this case, the onus of the action lies with the person who decided to (maybe, not sure how much of a factor alcohol was) drink so much they couldn't keep their hands to themselves. 

In the example of how the law deals with assault/harassment/rape, if the victim is intoxicated, they are given protections - even if they chose to drink to intoxication, they may not agree with the sexual act that took place.

If the aggressor is intoxicated, they are held responsible for their actions because they chose to drink to the point of intoxication thereby willingly impairing their judgment to the point of violating someone else's body, even if it's ""just"" harassment ass-slapping.",JiggyWopWop,t2_knqz5,3,0,reddit3
