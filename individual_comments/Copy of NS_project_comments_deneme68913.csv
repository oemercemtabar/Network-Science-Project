In AITA
A man is the asshole for dating a single mom and wanting alone time away from the child but a woman dating a single dad who doesn't want to move in with him because she isn't interested in having a child around is fine because they want different things in life.

In relationship advice
I saw people performing mental gymnastics again to defend a woman who would slam cupboard and room doors when upset.


In all subs
A man expressing boundaries is controlling and manipulative but a woman doing it is protecting her mental health.
A man clearly depressed is useless and needs to be kicked out and is a loser but woman with depression needs to see a therapist and needs help immediately.
A woman being abusive to a man needs help because she is obviously having mental issues but a woman who is receiving abuse needs to leave immediately.
Any couple with a toddler having issues and the woman has ppd regardless even if op says the she has seen professionals and hasn't been diagnosed with it

And post anything MRA and be prepared to get hell rained upon you

Edit:

There's a post on Relationships about a guy whose wife is constantly breaking or damaging stuff and he was fed up... Below is the top comment

>Ask her how this happens? Maybe she has an underlying medical issue that is making her lose control in her movements, or maybe she has attention deficit issues. These things can be worked out if you find out what is causing it and work on finding a solution.

Now reverse the genders, the man would be called abusive, dangerous, the guy is careless and needs to pay for the damage and she needs to leave him because he obviously doesn't respect her or her belongings.

Edit 2:

* SAHMs spend 1 hour and 45 minutes a day cleaning.

* SAHMs spend 1 hour and 23 minutes a day shopping.

* SAHMs spend 1 hour and 8 minutes a day helping children with homework.

Their favourite is post partum depression. That woman can abuse her partner, her child, be lazy and negligent, but it isn't her fault!

They diagnose her like the medical experts we all know they are and absolve her from all responsibility.

By contrast, a man who is having a tough time adjusting to parenthood should just man up, have greater empathy for his partner, offer HER more support and stop complaining.

I know that there is growing sexlessness among young men but they are also marrying far less when they get older and do get into relationships (usually in their 30s). And I don't blame them for not wanting to take on these burdens when the expectation is they just labour for a lifestyle she wants, labour for the kids she primarily desires, and must labour even more so she *feels* like there is a proper split in domestic duties (that actually favour her).

There is no expectation placed on women in the same way and to suggest it is sexist.

Liberalism is different from leftism in that liberalism is a globalist pro-capitalist ideology, and leftism is a spectrum of a myriad of competing radical and moderate ideas (Most left-wing ideologies focus on economic issues such as labor unions, worker's rights, democratic workplaces, regulated economies, welfare and social programs, etc)

> Leftists swing to the totalitarian right when there stupid ideas don't work and people don't obey. 

Leftism can either be democratic, or authoritarian, just like rightism. Rightism can cover from Social Libertarianism and Constitutional Monarchism, to State Capitalism and Nazism. Similarly varied is leftism. From Social Democracy and Unionism to Marxism-Leninism and Stalinism.

> Genocide usually follows.

Not all left-wing countries have genocides, you're confusing them with communist ones. (USSR with Ukrainians and Germans, China with Uyghurs, Pol-Potism with intellectuals, etc)

> Look at how the Democrats and Hillary reacted to Trump winning they basically poisoned the pussy well. Started the Me2 blackmail movement. They falsely accuse their political opponents and attack their mental health.

American politics isn't everything, bud. Plus, the Democrats are just more moderate capitalists, not communists or socialists. They agree on almost everything except for notably their social policy (identity politics, feminism, gender issues, etc)

> They behave just like a communist government.

You are Protected in Law under **Section 27 of the Equality Act** - **Victimisation**. 

Raising any concern of bias is a ""Protected Act"" and any retaliation is Victimisation and actionable through both courts and employment tribunals. 

When raising any concern it is wise to state that you are Undertaking a ""**Protected Act - Section 27 The Equality Act 2010**"", as this serves notice to any party that they are obliged to protect you from any form of Retaliation, Harassment etc as they can find themselves being sued. 

**[27 Victimisation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/27)**

(1) A person (A) victimises another person (B) **if A subjects B to a detriment** because—

...   (a) **B does a protected act, or**

... (b) **A believes that B has done, or may do, a protected act.**

(2) **Each of the following is a protected act**—

...(a) bringing proceedings under this Act;

...(b) giving evidence or information in connection with proceedings under this Act;

...(c) **doing any other thing for the purposes of or in connection with this Act;**

...(d) **making an allegation (whether or not express) that A or another person has contravened this Act.**


(5) **The reference to contravening this Act includes a reference to committing a breach of an equality clause or rule.**

For example, the concept POSITIVE ACTION: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_action

>In Europe, positive action, roughly synonymous with affirmative action, is the promotion of people based on belonging to non majority identity groups in the workplace, educational institutions and positions in society, purportedly without prejudicing the criteria of selection by merit. In the United Kingdom in Harriet Harman's Equality Act 2010 ss 158-159, the term is used in the context of employment to allow selection of a candidate from an ""under-represented"" group, so long as he or she is no less than equally qualified compared to another potential candidate that is not from the under-represented group.

Now, I'm not 100% sure whether this applies specifically to this situation. But people here went all in on complete blanket statements about discrimination (""it's the same for boys and girls""), and now suddenly you are completely certain that this particular section provides the only answer. If this falls under ""POSITIVE ACTION"", you could indeed provide free IT education to girls and not boys.

I am going to sound very negative with what I'll say next, but please understand that I just want you to realize where you stand. I hope like hell that you are completely exonerated in this case.

With that said, I hate to tell you this, but in your case, as a male being accused in the workplace of something, it's not like an actual court case.

If a woman is making a complaint, she is automatically believed, and it is up to you to DISPROVE her allegation. You will have a considerably more difficult job DISPROVING something that is believed without any actual proof required for that belief. Make no mistake, it will be on YOUR shoulders to prove your innocense, not on her or HR's shoulders to attempt to prove your guilt. That's just how this shit works. It's not fair, it's not even reasonable, but it is what it is.

Further, the absence of photos in your picture gallery doesn't prove you never took a picture, it only proves that it's not readily visible there right now. Forensic analysis of your phone could provide exonerating evidence.

No offense, but you're probably not rich enough or well known enough for your employer to dig that deeply into the case - honest to God, I'm not breaking your balls, I'm just saying. People on the tier of famous athletes, or huge business magnates are rich/famous enough to have forensic examination of their devices done to sort out those kinds of accusations.If HR decies they like her story, there's nothing you can do. They may not fire you for this particular situation because they know they would open themselves up to a potential lawsuit, but they may fire you for some other reason, or present you with the ultimatum of resigning or being fired ""for cause"".

Even if HR drops the whole thing, unless they discipline the false accuser, you will face the stigma of this for the rest of your time at this company. That female who accused you will tell her bosses that she is uncomfortable working on projects with you, and they will tell your bosses, and the whole issue of keeping you two separated will be annoying. Meanwhile, that woman is telling other females her bullshit story, and they will say the same things to their bosses and so on and so forth.

So... best case for you is that they believe you, and discipline her and she leaves. Unless that happens, you probably need to get your resume out there.

I would complain that company policy mandates that HR harass you and investigate you when there is no evidence at all. 

When I say no evidence what I mean is the testimony given was the picture was taken of someone at work but all they saw was the back of a camera, they did not see the other side. They did not see the photo app up, they did not see him press the picture button. They couldn't if the camera was faced at them to take their picture.

All they have is someone holding a camera nearby and then putting it away.

So with conclusively no evidence HR then told him his job was at risk for doing something they have no evidence of. After that, they ignored my attempt to protect myself by providing actual evidence of the claimed event not happening.

It is the legal responsibility of the company to provide a safe and harassment-free workplace and that is going to be very difficult when HR is the one doing the harassment.

For the companies who, for one reason or another, don't have a female on the board they'll do one of two things:  1 - move their HQ or even their whole business out of the state to a place that doesn't have discrimination and/or hiring quotas as part of their legislation or 2 - create a meaningless chair on the board to be filled with whatever harmless mid-level executive woman they can find so that they're abiding by the rules; she can have her office and think she matters, but it's effectively busywork meant to satisfy a requirement and spare the company some expense.",LabTech41,t2_1fkpqe,17,0,reddit1

I would also like to see their reasoning, particularly as to why they believe women can't get these jobs without the government's support. The fact is any company can rebuke this by simply showing the government all female applicants' applicant scores and application papers. If there is discrimination occurring they will be able to see it in the papers (and there won't be in most cases).

I remember going through a similar process.

I eventually settled on classical liberal , you may wish to look into it, I think you would be a natural fit.

> I don't believe women have much good, if any, in them.

My father was a ladies man, a real vag slayer type. He told me that women are strongly receptive to the environment men create around them. I believe he has a point and that women, to some degree, can be molded to be less like other women and closer to what the ""ideal"" (I.e. not horrible) is. 

As a quick anecdote, in the past , almost a month or so, I had been talking to a girl that I met at work, not a coworker where I work but is dropping by semi regularly for a project that is being done.

Anyway, we really hit it off, she is cute and seemed like a girl I could really invest in.... yesterday I went out drinking with a buddy of mine. Turns out he met her sometime ago, he had pictures to prove it. Apparently she's a massive slut and he did her every way he could, in every place he could.... I looked into it and everything indicates that she was, and probably still is, incredibly slutty. 

I feel like an idiot for thinking I had found a unicorn; A cute, hard working, non-hyper entitled girl that could hold a conversation quite skillfully.... I legitimately don't know how I could have been so foolish as to believe and hope in something like that.... sigh.

So while I agree with you that maybe this subreddit should be for strict activism, it is refreshing to you just express a very observable and widespread opinion (that women gossip heavily) without being called a woman hater. But of course there are always people like you to insinuate that we are XOXO

But one can also argue that it is a mens rights issue (although a small one) because it discusses gendered behaviour. When one gender performs an action it has a reaction on the other one. 

For example it used to be common place amongst men to use pretty aggressive language when talking to one another (""come on get that report done so we can do to the pub, you lazy shit""). Men do not mind and it is quite common. Of course this does not work well for  women in the workplace,who on average prefer more neutral language.

Similarly when women gossip and bully themselves but also form solidarity together in public effects the way men interact with them in teams. for example I had to sit through a painfully bad presentation presented by a female college in my team meeting, most of the team are female. When I or my other male team member showed any sign of constructive criticism we were shunned and all the female team members showered the presenter in compliments.

Maybe women, like men, need to adapt their most natural behaviour in the workplace in order to achieve a more functional team structure, or maybe i need to learn the ways of the queen bee and start validating and gossiping too. Who knows...

The men built shelter, found food quickly, got along with each other, and it eventually looked like a tropical vacation by the end.

The women... Oh the women. They were so sure that they would beat the men out because girl power! We know how to work as a team and the men will all try to be independent and do their own thing. They said the men would start fighting with each other and nothing would be accomplished. Guess what happened when it came time to put up or shut up? 

They failed, miserably. They almost immediately started fighting with each other, calling each other names, and gossiping about their teammates. They never got a shelter built, and they never found any food. By the end of the second day, the women's team was reduced to blubbering, crying, and complaining about how unfair and hard it was. I believe they had to end the event early for them as they didn't ever get shelter or food and were a real safety risk to themselves.

Take a small-to-medium sized group of men and set them to some task and you'll find a degree of cooperation second to none.   They will naturally organize themselves into hierarchies of ability* without the need to create leaders/rulers, and an honor system will develop.   If disputes arise they will be solved quickly, sometimes (though not usually) with physical violence, after which the competing parties will [make up](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-36969103).   

Take a group of women and set them to some task and you will find a long, drawn out attempt to establish consensus about the most trivial of matters, combined with a great deal of passive-aggressiveness, malicious gossiping and repeated cycles of emotional turmoil.   Conflicts often take the form of Machiavellian social violence.

But what happens when you put the two sexes together?  

In the case of men, competition dramatically increases.  In the case of women, *solidarity* dramatically increases.   So the exact opposite effects for either sex.   If one woman is harmed it is viewed as an attack on ""all women"", whereas if one man is harmed it is viewed as an attack only on that individual man.   

Whereas men band together to protect women (sometimes at the expense of female autonomy), women band together in solidarity *against* men, evidently for safety and protection.   This would seem to be a protective evolutionary mechanism that, with the feminist movement, has now become profoundly dangerous.   

*Hierarchies of ability are different than institutional hierarchies.   The former are meritocratic and do not require coercion; different people are better at different things, so it makes sense for people to have different specialities.   Institutional hierarchies are usually based on violence and coercion, though may also include meritocratic elements.",Vwar,t2_15qoa077,22,0,reddit2

It's a collective label. It is a term that describes a group of people who share a similiar ideology.

They are grouped together because they are, in fact a group.

>There's no memo that goes out and there's no specific person calling the shots.

Then the group designation is meaningless. if all feminists are only individuals with no ""memo"" or central ideology then the label is completely useless and serves no purpose because it conveys no useful information about the person or group. 

In order for the word to have meaning there have to be distinctions and ways of measuring what is and is not a feminist. A term that can mean anything, means nothing.

This is a rhetorical scam called a motte and bailey doctrine which feminists will attempt to pull all of the time. They will claim that feminism is not a hivemind or has no teachings/dogma/central ideas/etc as a means of deflecting criticism for the bad things done by their group (we'll call this proposition A). Then they will turn around and make claims about how feminism fought for the vote for the women, or how feminism is all about equality, or feminists don't hate men, etc. (Proposition B).

Note that both of these claims are contradictory. If there are no central ideas or tenets of feminism and it is all just individuals then feminism cannot be credited with women getting the vote, nor can they say that feminists don't hate men or anything else.

The reason they do this is because if feminism is portrayed as a group of individuals then the ideology cannot be held to any standard and it gives them a way out for any responsibility for the things that they do. The downside to this however is that, as I mentioned, it renders the entire concept and authority of feminism useless and irrelevant.

Which is why they will quickly switch to the other side when they need to speak with authority. That however opens them up to being disproved and held to standards. Which is then they quickly retreat back into ""Feminism is just about equality"" or ""There are many different ways of being a feminist"".

It's the typical behaviour or any cult or religion when it gets called out on it's doctrines or dogmas and their effects.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV5JoFLnikg

>There is no vanguard feminist organization.

There is, however, a central ideology and core tenets adopted by nearly all feminists. There are mountains of feminists texts and scholarly work one can read. You can look at the most supported and vaunted feminists and see what they say, advocate for and think, you can look at the organizations.

You can look at all of feminism and see VERY clearly what their goal is and what their ideology stands for and represents.

There's a reason that the vast majority of women do not identify themselves as feminists - and it's not because they don't believe in equal rights.

It's because of the absolute absurdity of anyone who identifies as a feminist.

Just because some people tell you feminism is about equal rights doesn't mean that it is. A movement is defined by what its members protest for, and feminists absolutely do not protest for equal rights.

The ""equal rights"" saying is just a convenient little mantra that they use to fall back on whenever you call them out for their bullshit when it so obviously isn't for equal rights.

I learned my lesson a long time ago when dealing with women in a corporate environment... I had to arm myself for the next encounter.  From then on whenever I was in a meeting with them I always recorded with video what was said (kept my phone in my shirt pocket) and saved the video.

Now 99% of the time conversations were good but the 1% that were not were career ending if I did not have proof of what was going on.  I had 2 encounters that if I did not show what actually happened I would have been canned, some other male co-workers did not have as good luck.  Is working with women wrong? Definitely not, but there is a reason rich and powerful men in public view companies no longer mentor women... or even have lunch with them 1 on 1.  Think about it.

My choice to involve a female lawyer who I met through a family member (one of his in-laws) was a mistake on my part I admit. But the male lawyer I met several years later for a different case said he would have taken that case in a second. ""I do female on male sexual harassment cases all the time, they're no different than usual"" he quipped.  

The female lawyer told me, after months of seldom returning my calls that it ""just wasn't a case my office would normally take"". So much for prompt honesty.

I'd have understood if she told me that from the get go but neglecting the case until I could no longer seek justice seemed despicable to me.

>There are no billionaires in the legislature you realize, but you'd have to really stretch to argue that this means they don't have power and only have ""Influence"". They control society through lobbying, and as the post notes, women have the second largest lobbying complex in the world devoted to their interests. This is the key part:  
>  
>Men do not have such a lobby. The interests lobbied for are stuff like war, oil, and so on. In the same way as we are oppressed by oligarchs abusing campaign finance and so on by those organizations forcing through their special interests at everyone elses expense, feminism oppresses men by forcing through womens interests at the expense of men.  
>  
>The trick you are pulling is to argue that because men fill the roles of ""Oil lobbyist"", that makes them balanced out with women holding the role of ""Lobbyist for women"", but that's simply not the case. The oil lobbyist cannot use the funds at their disposal to begin arguing for mens issues. They can use them to argue for the interests of the oil company, and that's pretty much it.  
>  
>I also think the actual sex of the politicians who do the bidding of these lobbyists is largely irrelevant.

So. Men when they lobby act on behalf of their interest group, individuals of which are both men and women, at the expense of another group, individuals of which are both men and women. That is, men's lobbying isn't gendered. Women, however, can uniquely lobby in favour of women at the expense of men. That gives women, specifically, additional advocacy on their behalf. Thus, that's more power for them.

In other words it doesn't matter if the lobbyists for any given cause are all men so long as they represent the interests of a group that's comprised of both men and women at the expense of a group comprised of both men and women. Women aren't unrepresented nor are they uniquely targeted simply due to the lobbyists themselves being male. But men are most definitely not represented at all by feminist lobbying - in fact, the lobbying is done for the benefit of women at the expense of men. And men have no such male equivalent.

Anyway you're basically arguing from the perspective of what the lobbyists ultimately represent and how much power this ultimately affords each sex instead of the sex of the lobbyists themselves or the sex of the politicians who do the bidding of these lobbyists. Your interlocutor in that thread almost exclusively focuses on the sex of the lobbyists and the sex of the politicians without really considering what they stand for, which I think is a myopic take.

I think Karen Straughan noted this behaviour is something paralleled in chimpanzees, too - males form coalitions to enforce the interests of their entire group onto out-groups. Females form coalitions to enforce the interests of females on the group. Males have no such ""male coalition"" for males.",problem_redditor,t2_3cc6xril,3,0,reddit3

Yup, what you should have done (*for the future or in case anyone else finds themselves in a similar situation*) is the following:

* Document everything, record every conversation that you can, print out every email & keep a written daily record (get a journal with number pages that can’t be removed & each day write the date & list every event which happened that day - it is actually admissible in court as supporting evidence).

* At least once a week, but preferably daily or as frequently as the occur, bring the subject up to your manager & schedule a meeting with HR to review each of the transgressions that you have documented in your notebook.

* Write a written summary account of every meeting or conversion that you are in which relates to any of the following: Any incidents of harassment you have experienced, your attempts to report said harassment, the managers or HR persons response & especially any conversations about your performance of your job duties - then email it to your manager, their manager & the HR dept & BCC a copy to an email address that you control & the company can’t access (because they will end up locking you out of your email account).

* Avoid using any terminology that could be perceived as hostility, frustration, sarcasm - remember a judge is going to be reading every single document which you bring to court in support of your claim & any document the company can find which will make you look bad. You need to appear like a well intentioned employee who is trying to resolve the situation in good faith.

The goal here is to be the annoying as fuck squeaky wheel & make it obvious that you are documenting **everything** (*just for clarity & to prevent any misunderstandings of course - don’t ever actually say that you plan or intend to sue them,* **again** *You need to appear like a well intentioned employee who is trying to resolve the situation in good faith.*)

They **want** you to quit because they know how much harder it will be for you to get a lawyer to sue them if you quit.

So don’t let them win - make it a game of figuring out how much of a nuisance you can be (*innocently of course*) until the fire you.

Quite frankly, most companies will fire you not long after you start documenting everything - because their position in court can only get worse from there.

They are trying to harass you into quitting & the longer they let you document that fact, the bigger your settlement will be - so (*& I’ve witnessed legal counsel advise this exact thing*) it is better for them to trump up some bullshit reason for firing you than let you keep collecting more & more evidence of their wrongdoing.

- Yes, i'm office based. This isn't really a surprising thing, a huge amount of jobs are office based, including (based on interpretation and OPs history) his job in question. If it were manual work, it would be a different kettle of fish, as there are substantially less women in those areas.

- Studies do not generalise, this is misunderstanding how studies work, exactly the same way that most people misunderstand how statistics work. Actual scientific studies simply provide information, and a summary of information found. They are intended to inform you, not to tell you what to do. If a study finds that men are more likely to be in a car accident than women are (note, not an actual study, just pulling a scenario out of my head), it is not telling you that you should only be in cars where men drive, it's giving you the information so you can make an informed decision.

- Your lived in experience is a small sample size, as you yourself have stated. If you apply your lived in experience as a whole to an entire set of people, then you are applying a bias. Even if you have had prior experience with it, you are still applying a bias, and biases historically result in poor results. Apply your same bias to something like skin colour, and see how that works. ""Well i've worked with 3 black people in my life and they all worked less than me, so I refuse to work with black people now"". It doesn't sound good does it? It doesn't sound good because it's inherently incorrect. If instead you'd added in qualifying information, it becomes much less biased, and much more appropriate. ""X people who belong to Y location over the period of Z years have proven to me that {insert possible bias here}, I therefore aim to limit my interactions with X people, to reduce risk. I've also improved my ability to detect when people are {insert possible bias here}."". Qualifying information is incredibly key, and applying a bias, even if it's based only within your life and on your personal life experience, on a _single_ criteria is simply wrong.

- I have no idea what you're trying to say with attracting insane women 2 out of 3 times. I don't know where you've got the 3, I don't know how you're taking interpretation of data out of this, I pulled a scenario out of nowehere to show an example of incorrectly applied generalisation.

- Applying a generalisation is mostly applying a risk factor. I can take an example from my field, to simplify this matter. There are multiple published studies regarding working with third parties overseas, which explain the difference in working standards - particularly for indian overseas teams. I can use the information within this study to inform me that when i'm working with an indian offshore team, I need to have incredibly clear documentation, I need to ensure that anything I write has no assumptions in it, and no vernacular specific to my country, as this can introduce risk. This is not a generalisation, this is using the information within a study (and in some cases, from experience) to prevent risk, which is perfectly acceptable.

- You have not said that gender was your only data point, but in the context of the post, it was the only data point you provided.

- If you don't work well with female managers, there are two interpretations of this (without knowing any additional data points). Either there is something inherently wrong with the female gender, or there is somethign inherently wrong with you. If you provide additional data points (age, marital status, job description, role, location, company type, etc etc etc), then separate assessments can be made.


I do find it slightly funny that based on a very limited interaction, you determined that I need to work on interpretation, particularly because i'm in IT.

I'm both office and field based, thus the vast majority of female managers aren't experienced or qualified to manage us.

Biases exist, applying them for your safety makes sense.

Also, I don't advocate that others follow, nor that they exercise these biases, quite the opposite. I'm fully aware that some of my traits are wrong-think, but they are based on decades of bad experiences - without any good experiences.

- I never said there weren't qualifiers. I'm saying that in the context of this post, the only qualifier provided was gender, which is not an accurate qualifier when left on it's own, it's a bias. You've then doubled down and stated ""the vast majority of female managers aren't experienced or qualifed"", yada yada. This is actually a completely incorrect statement, there are no studies I can find that would suggest a woman is incapable of leading a group of engineers. There are less women in engineering, compared to men. You're more likely to find an incredibly competent man, because there are more qualified men. That does not mean that the vast majority of female managers are not experienced or qualified, just that there are less of them.

- Go and read the rest of the article that you copy pasted your generalisation definition from. In this case, you've copied it from a clinical study on hydrocephalus. In fact, the funny thing is, if you google generalisability, you'll find its application is prevalent for medical purposes - and much less so outside of anything medical related. There's a very good reason for that.

- I already agreed that you applied your lived in experience only to yourself, I also stated that you're therefore applying a bias.

- There is no cultural bias to address, because I have once again only provided an example to nail a point in, which is failing to get in for some reason. There is a large difference between applying a bias to a scenario vs applying a risk factor to a scenario.

- Applying a bias for your own safety is entirely incorrect. Take a racial one, as America seems to love racial things lately. You're more likely to be mugged by a black person than a white person - statistics confirm this. This does not mean that you should attribute the bias to all black people, because it fails to account for the _why_. And the why is simple - more black people in the US are in impoverished locations. Your bias therefore should not be against the race, it should be against a location. You're more likely to be mugged in Detroit than California, for example. And once more, i'll hammer this home in case it aims to derail - this is an EASY EXAMPLE TO GET A POINT ACROSS.

- Correct assertion that there are few qualifying bits of information about your future manager. But you yourself have said you've learned to identify that someone will be a poor manager due to decades of experience, so what are your qualifiers? So far, the _only_ qualifier you've ever provided is that they're female. What else?

- Again, regarding female gender as a whole, I will repeat again that this is within the context of your post. ""I will not work for female managers"" - the only qualifier you've provided is that they are female. If you like, I can add that a qualifier is that they're a manager, so now we're down to 3 commonalities: You, female gender and managers. So either you are the problem, the female gender is the problem, or managers are the problem. Yet you've already asserted you have no problem with male managers, therefore the problem is either you, or the female gender.ee",majestic_tapir,t2_1ckdoarz,1,0,reddit3

- knowledge and/or training

- exposure/experience 

- ability 

- leadership

- managerial style

And as I explained, it's not based in sexism, although their gender is a prime factor, it's simply maths. 

Less than 1% of people in my field are female. Of that percentage, about 20% are managerially qualified. Keeping with averages, about 30% of them are good managers.

Thus during the interview, if the future manager is NOT engineering qualified, I give that role a skip.

Oh and you'll notice the last two were the ones you provided, which don't back your statements at all, and instead explicitly define that illegal discrimination involves an employer discriminating against an employee (or prospective employee), not the other way around.

> Yes, there is a hard legal case to win, and no employer is going to sue an potential employee for not taking a job. Still within the legal statements for them to do so.

No, there isn't. There's absolutely NO legal basis. Employers have a legal requirement to not discriminate against employees, there's no legal requirement for prospective employees (or existing employees) to not discriminate against employers.

You can quit your job arguing that you don't want to work for a company owned by a white man (for example) and nobody can do absolutely anything, unless of course you violate your contract by not giving proper notice or whatever.

> How to win an argument. Insults. That's how you know you're in the right!

> Noone deserves to be discriminated against for something they cannot change. Noone. Ever.

Great. That still changes absolutely nothing, the law does not protect employers from discrimination. If you're hiring an assistant and you don't hire them because of characteristics they can't change, that's illegal. If you're hiring an assistant and the assistant doesn't want to work for you because of characteristics you have, tough luck, it's perfectly legal.

Men may in fact rob more banks, but nobody disagrees with the law itself.  And in cases like alimony, the defensibility of its intent if not execution.  An ostensible goal is to keep ex-spouses who had no career while married from ending up in penury.  Discuss that on your own time.

e5jjbpf,t1_e5jfrtx,2018-09-07 06:09:33,MensRights,"As for the documents, from what I've been able to find, his rulings and the documents pertaining to them have all been released. The documents the Democrats are seeking to be released are confidential papers from the top level of the Bush administration when he was the staff secretary. Neither Republicans nor Democrats would willingly release confidential presidential documents this soon after the end of their respective administrations.


It isn't like Kavanaugh has been hiding either. Not like he could take part in halting the release of the documents anyway. He was made available to meet with anyone who wanted to meet with him, not a single Democrat did. Some of those confidential documents were made available in supervised setting open 24/7 to every single Democratic Senator, not one showed up. This was never about documents or wanting to learn more about him, the loudest Dem Senators had already gone on record opposing him, this was about delaying the hearing until after mid-terms when they think they have a better chance at shutting him down.


What perjury? Also, any evidence at all that Kavanaugh is totally in Trump's pocket?


The clown show has almost exclusively been coming from the Left. Booker literally used his Day 1 line of questioning to help fundraise immediately after the hearing ended. Harris insinuated that Kavanaugh has had conversations about the Mueller investigation with a lawyer who works for the firm that represents Trump. As far as we know that was totally fabricated. Booker ""broke the rules"" by releasing confidential documents that he knew were actually cleared to be released the night before, but acted like he didn't know they were cleared in an attempt to be censured. Afterwards he said it made him feel like Spartacus, since that's the whole point of this shitshow.


Kavanaugh is a milquetoast pick, a Constitutionalist through and through. There were many on the Right disappointed with the pick bc Trump could have easily gone with a more clear right wing judge and had them been a shoo in. Please save the histrionics for the actual controversial things Trump does, there is plenty of it.

I refer you to this section of the article linked below. 

Health is not only about disease prevention, but also about well-being and the avoidance of harm. How harmful is routine non-therapeutic circumcision? The overall rate of immediate and long-term complications arising from newborn circumcision is a matter of debate and in truth unknown. The estimated rate of complication worldwide has been reported as lying between the extremes of 0.1% and 35%.27 Minor complications such as bleeding, infection and prolonged hospitalization are thought to occur in less than 5% of cases. Tragic partial or complete penile amputation, urethral injury and even the rare death have been reported. Meatal stenosis requiring intervention occurs in 5%–10% of males circumcised in the newborn period.28 This is believed to be secondary to dermatitis of the unprotected glans exposed to wet diapers. Circumcision revision under anesthetic for penile concealment, skin bridges or an unacceptable cosmetic result is probably the most common long-term complication prompting a urological referral: in one survey, fully one-third of pediatric urologists in the United States reported experience as an expert witness in circumcision litigation cases.29

Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting and female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.Typically carried out by a traditional circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. In half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut before the age of five.

They consistently hire less qualified minorities over more qualified white people. It's gotten worse and worse. Right after the occupy Wall Street movement I was applying for finance jobs and all of these weird first generation immigrants were getting these corporate positions over me. Some of them are smart and deserved it but a lot of them were stupid as fuck. Like Haqqim who sells stolen iPhones with a 2.6 GPA gets a similar job I interview for and when I go in all I get asked is ""What is your greatest achievement?"" like six different ways and get sent home. This went on for 5 years of bullshit and finally I left NYC for a red state and in 1 interview I have a job. It sucked and didn't pay as well as corporate jobs but the point is it's definitely a blue state corporate thing to not hire white people. The whole time this was going on my parents are acting like I am somehow a failure. And now that I have been moving into more professional jobs there are all these minorities in positions of power who do not deserve them.

The thing that has me really pissed off is I have student loans that I have been unable to pay off largely because I was unable to find a job that I rightfully deserved for 5 years. Those loans are owed to the federal government who pushes these DEI policies. The federal government is literally sabotaging my ability to pay back the loans while these asshole fucking politicians keep rambling on about bootstraps. The federal loan is the sticking point simply because at this point this is literally usury and racketeering. I saw a lot of this shit happening back during Obama and people just laughed it off or acted like it was a conspiracy. Now articles like this are coming out and it's a combination of vindicating and infuriating. Is it really too much to ask for the government just to keep the playing field even?

The republicans just put out a statement about how the corporations should hire based on merit. It's sort of too little too late for me. My young professional adult life was basically ruined and sabotaged and the entire time I suspected I was being fucked over and it looks like I was right. The worst part about it is they made it seem like there was something wrong with me. And now you think I want to work with or for these people? You think I am going to respect any of them? Seriously. Fuck them.

Luckily for the democrats they have a whole new generation young people to sell their tolerance bullshit to. There's no tolerance every person wants the same thing. You're just putting these people on a. pedestal at the expense of the people who were here first. And a lot of them are not successful yet either.

The student loan thing has me pissed because in any other situation this would be tortious interference. It's why the government shouldn't be allowed to act as a business and loan people money. It's so fucked up. You can't tell me not to be racist and make policies that literally take from me on the basis of race. It's a zero sum game assholes.",RichLong77,t2_m50hswx7w,63,0,reddit1

When I looked online for positions, none of them talked about what math is, why it's important, why kids are struggling in it, and what we can do to get them back on track. Instead, each job listing boasted about its school's commitment to diversity and equity, and several said that they were especially looking for applicants who are women, BIPOCs, and members of the LGBTQ+, so I gave up. I find this exclusion tragic, because I would be a great math teacher, at a time when kids need people who actually understand the subject and are passionate about it.

And I feel white men in general have not been allowed to really have the same influence on the propaganda that other groups have had. Hip hop has had basically a monopoly on machismo and what used to be rock n roll since the 90s. It's funny how the criticize the white influencers for toxic masculinity while hip hop has been the bastion of toxic masculinity since day 1. I have always recognized art as propaganda. And if you look at mainstream media you have basically hip hop on one side and cable network cop shows on the other. So women are basically looking for government employees or black criminals.

For awhile I was going to raves and it was awesome tons of hot european girls in fairy wings. And then sometime around dubstep that got sort of shitty. It stopped being as underground and cool and became mainstream. For a brief moment because of it's wierd status it was it's own unique culture. The day I stopped being interested was when some rapper came on one of my festival sets and said, ""Electronic music has finally arrived."" And I was just like I thought ""no one listened to techno"" . But as usual where there are hot european girls there is that hollywood crowd trying to liberate them in some way. There were black DJs in the scene that were cool and that's sort of the point I am trying to make. It's not just race its propaganda and culture.

There seems to be this group that just fucks everything up by taking whatever art you have and vandalizing it with their racial agenda. The reason I switched over to electronic music in the first place was because I just didn't want to listen to people bitchin' and talking shit anymore at my party. I definitely don't need some dude acting like he's hot shit on my stereo when a bullet goes through him just like everybody else.

A black person who shoots up the block and kills a bunch of innocent people he is a gangster and revolutionary. If a white boy shoots up a school hes mentally ill and crazy or you can work the government or be a retarded doctor. Those are the molds society has placed white men into and how women perceive them. TV is literally dominated by the same narratives. African and Muslim violence is excused while white violence is maligned. So you end up with a huge portion of the population who feels since their violence is justified they must be oppressed and vote in their favor to make it stop. Meanwhile a white kid shoots up a school and we need to do something about the guns and mental health hes crazy. They have taken the protective aspect from normal men and put it in the hands of black gangsters or cops/military.

What is produced by the American media establishment today is really not art but bullshit propaganda. Part of the reason the women believe what they believe is because hollywood and the music industry has conditioned them to believe it. All you have to do is look on reddit to see how many comments are practically MSNBC talking points rather than actual original opinions to realize how the vast majority of people are informed by media rather than experience. That's why as much fun as it is to talk shit about women you have to realize it's the men who are hiding behind them that are responsible for your problems.

There is literally a show on appletv that makes the outlaws of the wild west out to be serial killers. Great they found gangster white men from the 1800s and turned them into creepy serial killers as well. I guess only muslims and black people get to commit murder and be cool revolutionaries. But thats always been a thing for the people from those areas of the world. Vandalizing people's culture. What Joe Biden calls a history of white supremacy and domestic terrorism has largely been white self defense starting with the barbary wars and they attacked us. It's annoying because we have to constantly battle false equivalencies.

Maybe we've hit the continuity of continuous bullshit because of AI. The propaganda is so blatant and also so in your face it just like holy shit. Talk about no talent or creativity whatsoever.

Agreed.

And the people who benefited from discriminatory hiring practices during Jim Crow, much of whom are still alive and in the workforce. 

&#x200B;

I don't disagree with your points, I just think a lot of you have your heads up your ass if you think that what is happening now is only because of slavery. Jim Crow didn't end until 1964, which means that legal, race based segregation and discrimination, didn't end until 59 years ago. Many of the people who benefitted from those hiring practices just retired in the last 15 years. 

I work in construction, and there are companies in my city that were being sued into the late 90s because they were found to have been participating in race based discriminatory hiring practices. They were only sending white people to the biggest jobs, or keeping them on the payroll through the winter but laying everyone else off. One of those companies just had a case re-opened because someone that won a case in the 90s just retired, and now the court has to calculate how much pension they lost because the company was being racist when giving out jobs. 

That's not slavery, that's modern day racism, but y'all are crying on the internet about ""I wasn't a slave owner"" instead of figuring out a way to fix this shit ASAP so that you're no longer getting fucked by the decisions of someone's racist ass grandpa!",Red_Dwarf_42,t2_jbf6yns4h,-2,0,reddit1

k9828oi,t1_k97hn8f,2023-11-14 15:40:00,MensRights,"At this point why the fuck not. They always talk about WWII while ignoring the fact that WWI was basically the British drafting and brainwashing Irish and Italian immigrants to fight to defend their empire. WWI resulted in the holocaust because the Germans basically got revenge. And as usual the allies are just the poor victims and they can't believe it happened. After war usually food is in short supply so the women will literally prostitute themselves for it. So if you take out all the bullshit propaganda and all the ""good guys vs bad guys"" nonsense basically they killed a bunch of German men during WWI and then fucked their women. Then cried about it when in WWII the Germans did the literal equivalent of a ""call the cops bitch"". And pre nuclear age might made right and it applies to all European colonial powers.

My biggest issue is that I have read so much random history that I have heard all of the bullshit before. American propaganda has basically inversed Nazi propaganda by making the black people the victim of oppression when largely they are the oppressors and the most violent people in the community. I use the Hutu as an example. No one ever brings that up. Even when BLM says ""the struggle is real"" I laugh because they're the burden. Anyone who thinks that looting stores and rioting is a political revolution is definitely a burden on all of us. The shoplifting is so bad where I live they don't carry designer shoes at Nordstroms anymore. Yay for exporting American culture throughout the globe.

The same way I laugh when I see some of these people walking around with swastikas who look like they've been vacationing at Chernobyl. You would think if you were going to start an evil empire you would come up with something original. And a lot of them don't really meet the brand standard in terms of looks or intellect. If you want to take over a government and murder millions of people tattooing a swastika on your face doesn't exact scream strategic political brilliance.

My major concern always has been the preservation of my constitutional rights. It's not the governments job to insure ""racial equity"". It's their job to protect the constitution from all threats foreign and domestic. And forcing businesses to hire people based on race is violation of their rights to freedom of association. And quite frankly I feel they are essentially seizing peoples property without due process by denying people jobs while charging people interest on loans they issued. They are also unjustly killing them simply by destroying their potential and time while vilifying them which is a very british thing to do. The problem is most white Americans don't want to be seen as the oppressors and DEI initiatives pray mostly on white women the same way a Nigerian Peanut farm scam does.

[https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/committee-on-public-information/](https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/committee-on-public-information/)

The woke mob is basically using the same tactics Woodrow Wilson used to suppress people during World War I on white people in America today. It's funny to me because even in Ukraine they use a similar tactics. Where there are blondes there's some American Jew trying to liberate them from oppression. They are probably going to do the same thing they did to me in America virtue signal and put them in debt and enslave them once the war is over. I assure you living in America filled with all this middle eastern diversity ain't that great. And quite frankly their only export is bullshit Abrahamic shit religions and slavery.

It's funny simply because their argument is they are saving culture and spreading American ideals. What culture? America is nothing but a bunch of fast food chains and hip hop. It doesn't even live up to it's own bill of rights at home. And its slowly coming under control of a bunch of bitter resentful minorities who want to control 70% of the population.

The American government literally indebted the entire white middle class children and then sabotaged their ability to pay back the loans they gave them. Usury how interesting. Somehow I always end up drawing conclusions and going down paths that I specifically try not to go down. The concept of racial equity is nothing more than a power grab and is extremely intellectually dishonest and subsists on a victim narrative not an actual accounting. If they want to do some kind of racial discounted cash flow analysis to value the equity of each skin color in the human race I am down. DEI is literally reverse eugenics. And I reject it for the same reason I reject eugenics who the fuck thinks they have the right to make these decisions? White and black aren't even fucking races. They are colors. And if you want to get technical black is the absence of color.

Once the government or the media starts promoting behaviors of any kind it changes the nature of the objection. For instance do I care about interracial marriage not really. But considering the african american community has had the bully pulpit on American musical culture for 30 years and have been pushing violent propaganda that threatens emasculates American Europeans while pretending they are apart of some revolution. And its not because your music is that great. You just suffocate practically every other genre by bullying your way into it and taking advantage of the fact that most young white people are to stupid to know anything else. Then Prince Harry goes around with his interracial bride talking writing books about how much he loves America. AWESOME.

The confederate planters wanted nothing more than to blend with the British aristocracy. These are the same people who's major complaint was poor white immigrants were hard to enslave because they blended in with the free white people. These are the same people who would impregnate the black slaves because they felt mixed raced children were more ""docile and industrious."" So while you may think your on some next level shit with your mixed race child. In reality your just making it easier for these people to differentiate one class from another. Because similar to world peace as long as humanity exists they will have preferences and discrimination in some form or another will exist. So once the media or the government starts pushing agenda I stop listening and start thinking about all possible outcomes. It may be a beautiful car but just because the car salesman is telling you the car is reliable, cool and a great buy doesn't mean he cares whether you can make the payments or how what he is selling is going to affect your life in the long term.

h3xanp5,t3_ocxwrc,2021-07-03 14:45:17,MensRights,"The irony is women don't do emotional labor either.   Unless bitching and bullying and manipulating counts as labor.  If you count unproductive, anti-social and criminal behaviors as labor I guess maybe they have a point.  At best it's labor aimed at getting someone else to do something for you that you can't be bothered to do for yourself.

It's like a slave overseer complaining to slaves that they just don't understand what hard work it is having to whip them.

 ---------------------

What would legitimate ""emotional labor"" look like?

* Which sex commits suicide four times more often?  If women are supposed to be doing real emotional labor that feels like a fail to me.  Talking people off the ledge is hard work and emotional alright, but it feels like women are slacking on the job if that is to be considered their job.

* Emotional labor could mean romance and the small acts of love that keep a relationship together.  But it's men not women who do that stuff.  Saint Valentine's Day isn't about women giving men gifts.  Everyone knows Mother's Day is taken seriously and Father's Day is a joke.  Ladies are not as good as men at emotional labor is one conclusion from that.

* Men are constantly seeking to understand and mollify women.  That's why we have sayings like ""what do women want?"" but women's take on men is lazy and dismissive ""men only want one thing"" (something women are then encouraged to withhold as emotional manipulation). We say ""happy wife, happy life"" but nobody cares about the man's emotional needs.  People who would laugh at how awful a present for a wife a vacuum cleaner is would be just fine with buying tools for a man.

* When men get called to deal with a beetle or a spider isn't that emotional labor?

Against this stuff feminists argue women do emotional labor because they remember birthdays (do they?) and keep in touch with family friends.  That sounds a lot like they're just doing whatever they would have done anyway.  It's like arguing that playing video games is ""communications labor"".  If the woman is the one working to keep track of the man's friends who aren't her friends then you'd have a point, and that does sometimes happen.",DavidByron2,t2_gatel,157,0,reddit2

Hypoagency. If you need help, it's your responsibility to ask for help.

There's a lot of thing in her post that she's choosing to do, then she got overwhelmed and is now angry that her husband didn't ride up to her on a white horse as soon as she crossed the border from 'Things I'm Taking On' to 'Things I Need Help With'.

Also,

>he doesn’t ask what he should do to help because I’m a control freak (fair comment, I can be)

The husband very clearly stated why he doesn't get involved.

It's pretty clear that HE is doing a lot of emotional labour as she takes on too much, wants it all done 'the right way' (i.e., her way), and then gets upset when it overwhelms her and uses him as an emotional punching bag because it's HIS fault for not providing exactly what was needed in HER unknown, unspoken plan of action. 

It must be tiring going through that cycle.

To be fair, they both need to communicate their needs to the other.

It sounds like he wants to help but he wants also agency. He gets to do his tasks the way he sees fit. This would allow him to be more proactive.

It sounds like she wants ~~everything she doesn't have but needs, at the right moment and in the right way~~ more of his active involvement but she'll have to relinquish control and let go of the idea of perfection.

Finally, some people are just passive and will let cede power to whomever takes it. She must have known this before marrying this man but was perhaps too focused on the benefits to consider the negatives. A control freak can't have both a partner with passive personality that will allow the control freak the full measure of their power *and* the misandrist idealized version of a husband, who is competent and confident in all things, completely attuned to her emotions at all times and who will always shield her from reality by doing everything that needs doing in order to protect her from being overwhelmed.

>He says that he doesn’t ask what he should do to help because I’m a control freak (fair comment, I can be)

Oh, a self-admitted control freak has *also* henpecked her husband into being frozen, not knowing what to do. So she goes onto a feminist subreddit so people can enable her instead of working on her problem with her S/O. You can't make this shit up.

Her constant whining just makes her look like an exhausting person. In an 8-hour work day, I could completely plan an entire year worth of vacations, buy every type of insurance we need, do our taxes, do all of the holiday season shopping, meal prep for an entire week, clean our entire house from top to bottom, call special pickup for any old garbage we need to throw away, and even have time to clean out the rain gutters. The reason why I chose an 8-hour work day is because that's the average amount of time full-time working men spend working over full-time working women a week. 

Like, she's complaining about writing and recording a fucking *song* for someone, because obviously any reasonable person would put that right at the top of their priority list. Then she whines about men being shit.

You feel this ways because you bring this energy onto yourself, you take control, and you fear losing it. This whole post is nothing but a control tactic, its not a vent, you lost control of a situation and that doesnt suit you so you are trying to find someone else to blame and as always the one person in your life who puts up with your shit takes the blame.

 I bet that man has you in his thoughts EVERY minute of every hour every day, everything he does is overshadowed by the thought of what will X think, will this make X happy, will she be upset if i do this.

1. For some reason, pick a man who doesn’t put a lot of effort into anything.

Instead, expect him to magically understand (although you knew he didn’t before you got into a relationship with him) what needs to be done even though everything suggests that he does not. 
3. If he actually tries to help - do not under any circumstances accept a learning curve. Additionally, do not accept any autonomy from him. You do things your way - and he should know what you mean by your way. You shouldn’t have to tell him what to do, even though you will yell at him if he does something wrong.
4. Don’t talk about any of this. Be passive aggressive instead. Blame “society” even though you’re fully aware that you did not vet for or prioritize the traits you’re now angry at him for lacking when you decided to be with him.

Then after which, she complains about him not just helping out instead of asking if and where she needs help. That is so stupid it's insane. Firstly: she says he's quite good at the chores around the house, and maintenance. This makes me assume, everytime theres been a maintenance problem or a physical labor job, it's been his ass out in the sun or standing on top of a rickety labor, meaning she sat on the couch scrolling reddit or just handing him tools. I'm sure the husband wouldn't appreciate if she climbed that same ladder with him on it to help out, without asking if and where he needed help. The important part about asking where someone needs help is it avoids further setbacks by avoiding misunderstandings. She's complaining about him not being able to detect what needs to be done, which is all in her mind. Also, mother's day doesnt entitle anyone to anything except saying ""happy mother's day"". Seriously, who else took part in the action of you becoming a mother aside from your immediate family, and who initially asked to make a child? More often than not, it's the mother herself.

I mean I've never had a woman agree trade places with me.  Like not even factoring in a hypothetical job switch.  Just trading mowing and home maintenance and things like that for their share of the inside work (I already do quite a bit of the cooking and cleaning as it is).

As for gifts on holidays I do have a few observations there, but they mostly revolve around a lot of women thinking that kind of stuff is more important than it actually is, and taking control and bossing around the man they're with instead of letting him do things the way he wants to.

If I want to get something simple like a gift card to a nice restaurant and tell my mom in person how much I love her, and that's my style of doing things, why is that not valid?  Why do you automatically assume the consumerist, wasteful, frilly gift wrapped trinkets thing that she was doing is the correct way to do it?  And if he's leaving it to her it's only because she won't let him do it the way he wants to do it and he's leaned that mistake from previous years being with her.

Trust me I've been there done that with that exact type of woman and she, and every other woman like her, needs to take several steps back and give her man room to breath so that he can do things the way he wants to. Including for his own fucking mom on mother's day.  If she wants to do the wasteful, consumerist gift wrap bullshit with her own mom then she's more than welcome to. But it's his mom and if he wants to do something different he should be allowed to.  What you're looking at is an abusive, controlling relationship, and you are defending the abuser.  This type of shaming behavior is often what traps men like this into this type of bullshit.  And part of dismantling gender norms should involve calling out women like this who control and shame their partners and don't let them live their lives the way they want to live them.",Oncefa2,t2_15it3r,67,0,reddit2

In the most basic definition, no, of course I don't personally approve of men ruling over women as a socially accepted policy. But that was rarely and never truly the case in any society in history. In strictly hierarchical societies, yes, you had that dynamic at work but it was just as bad for lower class men. And really, it's not any different than what exists today where the wife of the highest standing man is second only to him.

But here we can see what's happened with the transition away from a patriarchical society: Women get the vote and immediately start voting perks for themselves with very little concern for society as a whole. Kooky ideas become the norm as ""experiements"" just to see what happens and society more or less starts breaking down with drug use and over-indulgence. Everything we've built more or less gets cashed in and used up because women as a group are terrible at planning for the future at a societal level. So, I kind of have to agree that patriarchy is good if the alternative is a bunch of flakey ideas using a lot of big words because they ""resonate"" with women without actually saying anything.",Past-Difficulty6785,t2_92u6vm9j,3,0,reddit2

Normally, I don't use the term 'equality' – in regards to romantic relationships – to refer to the balance of authority, but to the value of the persons. What people conflate quite easily in these conversations, is these two different kinds of equality.  


>Authority inherently implies there is a more powerful and a less powerful party in the dynamic, whether that be on the workfloor or in a personal relationship.

What you say here is true, and that's exactly what is so important as far as I'm concerned.

The reason there is a power dynamic in a company, is because the company is incapable of functioning properly without it. If there is no one consistently calling the shots on (important) decisions, you can forget earning a profit. It also has to be the case that the persons in these functions are suited for their positions. Different people have different skillsets; some people can be excellent project planners to carpenters, while they are horrible carpenters themselves.

None of this makes the people on the workfloor any less valuable than the manager, and it is similar in a romantic relationship.

The beautiful differences between men and women are designed by God to be complementary, not to be neglected. It's like switching the places of different cogs and gears in a perfectly designed machine. When you misplace these items, the machine may run for a while, or even just as long as it did before, but you will never reach peak performance when you tamper with an already-optimal design.",blanck24,t2_108mvy52,2,0,reddit2

What you say is true; there are always going to be societal stereotypes of masculinity and femininity, which change over time. They will often line up with proper ideals of the two, but when that happens, it's a symptom and not a changing of the actual principles. We shouldn't line up to the expectations of society, but to that which is *good*.

One such stereotype that I horribly dislike, is the idea that an authoritative man deals with his wife harshly, and punishes her physically or mentally in a harsh way. As far as I'm concerned, a good husband deals with his wife patiently, in love, *much* *more* so with his wife – who he has committed himself to for the rest of his life – than with anyone else.

A man who is authoritative does not have to rule harshly, it's a big misunderstanding. While they coincide sometimes, they are *far* from the same thing. A proper leader *serves* the people he leads. He ought to do it for them and not himself. The same is true for a man and his wife; a man ought to lead his wife, but do so by serving her. If a man has an unhappy wife because of the way he treats her, he's doing just as bad a job as a manager with depressed employees.

As far as I'm concerned, assertively serving (who is yet to be) your woman – that would be chivalry – is right in line with the core of the design; it's an absolutely beautiful thing.

Societal ideas often flow from complementarian principles, but they *aren't* the principles themselves.

Things like women doing the cooking and men going out to work, are, more than anything, side-effects or symptoms of keeping to complementarian principles. So, a man staying home or a woman going out to work, doesn't necessarily make either less masculine or feminine.

Leading by serving is actually the best way to lead, but it's not one many people know is even possible, because they've (almost) never experienced it.

The most important thing in leading properly, is to talk to people individually. If I see that there is a better way to handle something in my relationship with my girlfriend, and my girlfriend disagrees, I sit down and talk to her. After all, if I have chosen the most sensible option, I can make a case through arguments that this is actually the best way to go about things.

So we sit down, I listen to her disagreements, and we talk through them. If she is wrong, she'll gladly admit it (not always in the moment, but she always does), so we can move on in unison. The reason we constantly talk about things, is because I can be wrong too. If she can explain to me by making a case that I'm wrong, then I'll have to admit it and we can move on in the same way.

That's leading by serving. A leader is just as human as the people/person he leads; he makes mistakes.

By leading this way, there is no room left for harshness, except for rare situations where it is necessary. I don't ""keep my girlfriend in line"", she stays ""in line"" because she loves me. She *wants* to take my advice, she *wants* to let me lead and she *wants* me to correct her when she's in an emotional mood. Not because I force these things upon her, but because she's experienced all that as very helpful and positive.

A good leader is one that people *want* to follow, because they know he can lead them well. As a Christian, Jesus is the perfect example of leading through serving. It is because he loved people that people came to listen to Him and to follow Him.",blanck24,t2_108mvy52,1,0,reddit2

It sounds terribly depressing, but the best way I ever found to deal with sexism in the workplace during my many years on the job was to ignore the ones engaging in it as a group, and mention my displeasure only in a one-on-one setting if they made a sexist remark to my face.

When women passed male-bashing joke emails or cartoons to me, I trashed them.

Her: ""How long are those coffees going to take? A man must be making them"". 

Me: ""Leave it to women to complain about a free coffee that she didn't have to make being 20 seconds late"". 

The passive-aggressive sexists will eventually stop making jokes about men (around you) when you've hit them in the feels a few times. Just remember, say it as a joke. Smile and have a cheeky laugh at the end, you want it to be received as a friendly joke in jest.

I've spent a lot of my life trying to challenge people on their beliefs and lay out for them the logic and reasons why I think they'd be better off with different behavior.  Success?  Almost zero.  But lately I've been experimenting with consciously deciding to talk positively about certain things and it's had a lot of impact on affecting people around me in what I consider is a positive way.  

For example I think a raw diet is very healthy.  I've seen science to prove this.  I've shown people science to prove this.  I've reasoned it out so many times.  And nobody was interested.  

So I switched strategies.  

Now whenever someone asks how I'm doing I answer with something like ""well to be honest I feel better than I've ever felt in my life"".  If they ask why I say ""It's been this way consistently since I started the raw diet.  I don't think I'm ever going back to cooked food.""  

I never make it about them and how they're wrong.  I make it about me and how right it is for me.  

It may take some creativity to be able to speak well of men without it being obvious that you're actively trying to engineer opinion.  But here are some examples.  I don't mean use these directly, but think of things like them to say:  

* ""Hey did you hear there are groups of guys who decided to stay in the buildings in NYC when everyone else left, so they could take care of the elderly people on the top floors.  They have to hike up like 50 flights of stairs to bring these people water and food.""  
* ""You know my husband has a pretty good sense of this sort of thing.  The other night he said ... ""  
* ""I really like that guy Maurice who delivers on Wednesdays.  Have you noticed he's never late?""  

In short, be an example, not a critic.  It may not seem like it's working at first, but it will be slowly building an image in their minds and it will improve their thinking.  

Also remember that it's not just a problem because it's sexist.  If your co-workers like to while away the hours by complaining about stuff it's also a psychologically unhealthy activity.  Focusing and talking about positive things makes people happier and more effective, so you won't just be exemplifying respect for men but also positive thinking in general.

Just like the wedding is essentially a debutant ball for the bride in which the groom is simply lucky to participate, the birth and nurturance of the child is seen not as for the good of the child, but for the good of the mother.

Yes, they do happen sometimes, and that's why duglock suggested the direct orders to cease the activities. Thus they are being fired for not following directions as opposed to the act of harassment. All in all, it's very thoughtful on all sides of the coin. I mean, they could definitely just fire the individual for the sexual harassment and have **that** on the person's record but instead choose to side with a non-permanently-defacing-employee option.

Those conversations threw me smack up against realization of my own over- extended priviledge as a westerner and as a mom.  

Now, I actually feel like circumcision for non-Jews serves no purpose whatsoever than to conform to a religious standard that never applied to my family in the first place, we not being of the Jewish faith.  

Perhaps the presence of a majority of men having been circumcised lessens stigma for practicing Jews, but at the risk of sounding anti Semitic, why should an entire society conform to any minority's religious practice?  Many of these men are from protestant or agnostic perhaps even Catholic families.  How did this practice even come to be the societal norm in the first place?

To be honest, I hold the medical establishment partially accountable.  After giving birth, women who otherwise have not even considered circumcision as an option are quizzed by doctors "" do you want us to schedule a circumcision for your son?"". The idea is then planted, and the decision is often made after only a short conversation about historically inaccurate reasons why others have traditionally done it in the past.  This exerts a very subtle pressure for the parents to conform.  They are new at this parenting business, who are they not to take the advice of the older and wiser medical staff?  The decision is even easier if the parents already circumcised an older brother.  

Now I think  if men wantto appear Jewish (or whatever other religions may require circumcision, i am not an expert on religions) it ought to be an adult decision, like getting a body piercing or tattoo.

At the time I realized like everyone that the driver discriminated against him for his skin color. It didn't occur to me the driver discriminated against him for his sex too.

Here's the start of the New York Times article:

**Danny Glover Says Cabbies Discriminated Against Him**

By MONTE WILLIAMS
Published: November 4, 1999

The actor Danny Glover, of the ''Lethal Weapon'' series, ''Beloved,'' and other films, filed a complaint yesterday with the City Taxi and Limousine Commission, charging a cabdriver with discrimination on Oct. 9 for refusing to allow him to ride in the front passenger seat.

Mr. Glover, who is black, said he was already angry because several hours earlier five yellow cabs had failed to stop for him, his daughter and her roommate at 116th Street and Seventh Avenue.

At a news conference yesterday in the lobby of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, Mr. Glover, with his daughter, Mandisa, a senior at New York University, at his side, said he had been visiting her from San Francisco. When those cabs passed them by, Mr. Glover said: ''I was so angry. The fact that my daughter's here to go to school, it really upsets me that if she's standing on the corner waiting to get a cab, she can't get a cab. It happens to her, it happens to countless people every single day. The fact that I'm a celebrity, the fact that I'm visible, allows me to draw attention to this.''

tells you more about the fact women simply don't want the jobs, as opposed to any myth there's a ""patriarchy"".

Yet another example of the fact the ""Wage Gap"" is nothing but a myth in all but the minds of the delusionally persecuted and ignorant.

The fact is men work the dirty and dangerous jobs, as well as the more prolific and well-paid jobs. Women who say they want equality have no idea that men work more hours, including overtime, and that's why men earn more.

While i support the idea of women venturing into the realms where men historically dominate the fields, i can't help but think this is somehow going to be spun as the women failed because the men.

there will be some nonsense about ""barrier to entry"" and ""hostile environment"" to work etc, because it would else require the women admit they simply can't hack it doing some men's jobs.

the fact is women don't want these boring, dangerous, underpaid jobs. yet most women are totally fine letting their fellow men take-up the slack by doing dirty and dangerous jobs, while simultaneously complaining men aren't helping women achieve ""equality"" enough.

Then when women try to address the balance, they fail to support themselves to make the balance happen, proving their lip-service to such ""equality"" really is secondary to having the convenience of letting the men do all the work.

for all the hate against men for supposedly treating women like ""princesses"", the women certainly like to play the part well enough, right down to the entitlement and spoiled attitude of letting ""lesser"" men do the dirty work for them.﻿",p3ngwin,t2_3aa2m,5,0,reddit4

Most of these 'needs' were expressed before the first week was finished. I can't imagine pushing that hard anywhere as a new-hire.

It almost became a policy to avoid hiring them due to the extra hassles involved.

cn8gidj,t1_cn7ddka,2014-12-29 17:55:29,MensRights,"Ofcourse the demand is there. Doesn't mean it's right. The vast majority of women wouldn't want to date/fuck a taxi driver, so as far as they would be concern that guy is worth less than dirt. Better have a woman because, as the stereotype goes, she's safe and fun too! She's just another ""girlfriend"" with whom she can gossip with. It's not like they haven't been living the last few decades being told that women are all safe and friendly kindred-spirits, and men are misogynistic assholes and potential rapists for even having a sexuality.

And men? Why wouldn't they want a woman driver? They would be fine with fucking/dating a female taxi driver, if the opportunity was there. So, what's the benefit of having a male driver when all other relevant factors would be equal?  It's not like they haven't been living the last few decades being told that a woman can do everything a man can, and that they would be misogynistic assholes if they ever thought differently.

The problem isn't that the demand exists. The problem is the amount of sexism, ignorance and prejudice towards men to support that demand. If you went back a few decades in the US. There would most certainly have been a demand for ""whites-only"" taxi cabs, even if it was all rooted in prejudice, racism, ignorance.  Given that it is entirely socially acceptable to discriminate against men, the bigger money is with the majority that stands by that discrimination. The fact that there's money to be made by catering to bigots doesn't make it ethical to do so.  ",ExpendableOne,t2_4o06h,1,0,reddit4

That's like saying that, because there are more Indian drivers, this is ""their roles in society"". Which is both wrong and pretty offensive. Men and women can do the same things, the problem is that we live in a world where women still behave and are treated like princesses. They still want special treatment and have very sexist ideals, but still want men to provide it for them. 

 Most women don't want to work those hours because that would mean losing out on all the other social opportunities that would be abundant to them because they are women. Most women don't want to work those extra hours because the money is not as necessity for them the way it would be for men(having money is not a crucial/mandatory aspect of their social/sexual value). Most women would prefer to be driven and have fun/no-care than have to drive and be responsible/accountable. Given the same opportunities and preferential treatment, men would want the same things too.

 This is not even anything new. There's a reason why, in virtually every family, the father/man tends to be the one who does most of the driving. Not only does society reinforce those roles but women favour/value men by those gender roles.  This is a very similar problem to the one you have in STEM fields, where you have a lot of opportunities for women to succeed in those fields but find that most women don't want to work those fields because they have so many other alternative opportunities and privileges available to them.",ExpendableOne,t2_4o06h,1,0,reddit4

A.k.a. they aren't willing to take the risk/burden. If we find out that SheTaxi is willing to pay anywhere between $10 to $25 per hour (lower and upper average payrates for different driving services), then it's less about ""bad business"" and more about females having different priorities & levels of risk than males.

Edit: my speculation is further strengthened when you look at the taxi industry as a whole -- ""Currently only 3% of New York's 115,000 taxi drivers are female"".

I mean, heck, lets contrast and compare. 

If I step into a car with a driver, I know, the chances are roughly 30 %. 

30 % I am going to get a tweaker. You know, someone with obvious heroin scars, that tries to tell me about the one time he saw buddah in church, and he told him his highschool was ran over by welsh people. That is why he had to eat all those magic mushrooms, you know, divine need...The one that you can tell has just been off the needle for 2 weeks, and that tries to get his shit back together , and the only place willing to hire is the taxi. 

30 % I am going to get habib. Yes, I am using the stereotypical asia Minor / middle eastern name, because it's a stereotypical situation and allways the stereotypical guy. Nice guy, funny accent, name with more vowels then I have ever seen in a plate, but ALLWAYS with a smile. They will tell you, with an unflinching smile, how their wive hates them, their kids no longer want to be recognised as his race, his friends back home  in the old country think he is a sellout, and his little dog got run over by a drunk driver, but like a dolphin, he is smiling. Yea, he may smell weird, or listen to weird music, but generally, if it is too obnoxious, he will turn it down, and if the smell bothrs you he opens a window. 

30 % are road ragers / east block true man . You know,. stereotypical tough guys, who will be tatooed, silent, and if pressured, will tell you how they tortured a guy once and try to forget how good it felt to crush his windpipe with their fingers. ALL, with out exception, have seen all the rambo movies, and can do chilling impressions. Someone that's ""connected"" got them the job. They will know the speed limit by heart, because they are the guys all the GTA players wish they could be, as they use anything on the road to their advantage, telling you how this is nothing, back in 95 in bosnien herzogowina, he already drove 2 ton jeeps like this through a warzone full of snipers, untill those damn serbs blasted away his buddies head with a machine gun, and he had to run them over, and now he can hear the screams, but he is not going to a doctor, oh no, doctors are for women and injuries that require more then the tools in his toolbelt. 

The remaining 10 %? Normal, everyday guys. Of whom about 3 % happen to be female. 

Yea. I hold a taxi driving male to the same status that I hold a restaurant waitress. It's the kind of job that hires you with minimal qualifications. The kind of job you can do even if you have nothing else. 

So, I do not mouth off, I only complain if it is extra heavy, and I try to take it up with the driver rather then mouth off to the bosses and try to get them fired. And you know what? 

The wildest tweaker, the most turban wearing habib, and the true men respect that. They thank me profusely, because fuck yea, they need the job, and more writeups, and they would have gotten fired. 

So, that Female only service? I support free business, I really do, but if all you have to offer is women only drivers, then feck, think about the following: 

Taxi driving is the most diverse job on the planet. you meet people of all ages and races there, and most of them are dirt poor, and are getting treated worse then fast food workers. 

So, of course, if someone wants to not get into a normal taxi, how about we check them for systemic racism? 
Oh, yea, you know, in the papers, I read how black guys want to rape the white women, and how indians allways do group rape, and russian guys, the even use tools....

Of course, they are not racist, of course they are not priviledged beyond belief, they just prefer to be driven by, you know, acceptable women, you know, non scary people, preferrably of their own race. ",Meistermalkav,t2_5mn5y,31,0,reddit4

>A __hackney__ or __hackney carriage__ (also called a *cab*, *black cab*, *hack* or *London taxi*) is a [carriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage) or [automobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile) for hire.  A hackney of a more expensive or high class was called a __remise__. 

>In [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), the name *hackney carriage* today refers to a [taxicab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab) licensed by the [Public Carriage Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Hire) in [Greater London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_London) or by the local authority ([non-metropolitan district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-metropolitan_district) councils or [unitary authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_authority)) in other parts of [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain), or by the [Department of the Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Environment_(Northern_Ireland\)) in [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland).

>In the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), the police department of the city of [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts) has a Hackney Carriage Unit, analogous to taxicab regulators in other cities, that issues *Hackney Carriage* medallions to its taxi operators.

On the other hand, however, there are men out there who are physically weaker than a toddler and there are women who are physically stronger than a 6'4, 210 pound man. There are exceptions to the rule, there always is, but it does not happen often.

My last comment, however, is about how our society, thanks to modern feminism, preaches that women have to be afraid of EVERYTHING under the sun when crime rates have been at the lowest they have ever been.

I think the simple truth behind modern feminism is, in virtue, a very good one: Feminists want a world where women are not the victims of anything.

Not really seeing a problem with this.

Look, I'm not one of those utopian capitalists who slobs the market's knob, but sometimes market solutions work, and this is one of those times. The idea that companies will refuse to hire competent women in ~~2014~~ 2015 simply because they're women is absurd.

So: HeBrokerage is artificially limiting its ability to hire competent brokers and will have to compensate with above-market compensation to attract talent and pass those costs on to its customers. Now, either there's a real competitive advantage to hiring men, or there isn't; if there isn't, then customers will see that HeBrokerage costs more but doesn't deliver results, and HeBrokerage will fail.

The feminist angle on this is that HeBrokerage will have an unfair competitive advantage _because of sexism_, and that advantage has to be artificially removed, but there's not much evidence to support the feminist position.",guywithaccount,t2_cpl35,2,0,reddit4

This implies that they are *losing money* by failing to do so.  Don't confuse your micro and macro economics.  A single firm can't realistically attract more drivers without also paying it's existing drivers more.  You seriously think that shrinking the profit margin on existing customers in order to shrink the overall pool of customers is a smart business decision?  Everything here depends on marginal cost and price elasticity.  Taxi service is an interchangeable good and there is no added utility in having a female driver.  It's nothing more than marketing.

You're confusing business strategy with profitability. The best business strategy will be the least unprofitable, yes, but that doesn't mean that it guarantees that they will get enough revenue from that to make up their costs and actually turn a profit. The piece of data you're missing is that they're not profitable on weekends at the moment because they have too many cars to run and not enough drivers to service their customers.

Raising prices will allow for improved supply and better enable them to match their supply to their customer's demand. There is no guarantee, however, that they will be able to service enough customers at that price to stay profitable as a business at that time. They might only have 5 cars on the road at the current price, and be able to get 10 cars on the road at the market clearing price, and that might still not be worth the cost of maintaining the fleet and support personnel during that time.

icxf3tz,t1_icx3eqq,2022-06-19 09:38:37,MensRights,"Oh I'm sorry, are we casting for worst case scenarios?

Then no. Mens fear with feminists is that they'll end up abused, assaulted, accused, and disbelieved that any of the above is possible. Probably in prison since incarceration rates are several times more than that for women.

Less fear of direct death, more fear of having the rest of your existence be a tortured Kafkaesque nightmare where everyone believes you're a monster by default. Kind of like what you apparently believe given your ""venomous snakes"" example.

Context: Have been in an abusive relationship. Yes that included physical abuse. No I'm not going to elaborate on the details to assuage your next dismissal (""how can a woman hurt a man, she's tiny compared to him"" was I believe what one said). It was bad. *Really* bad.

Of course, feminist theory maintains that such a thing isn't really possible doesn't it? At least not without it fundamentally still being the male's fault as instigator:

> DV is intimate authoritarianism & if people could begin to see abuse as that-- an expression of an ideology/values system rather than as a personal failure or tragic but inevitable deviance-- they would also see the dire necessity of survivor-centered approaches to challenging it.

> As Bell Hooks said, ""the more accurate term for domestic violence is patriarchal violence because it reminds us that violence in the home is directly connected to male domination""

That's from a thread on r/feminism by the way. And if you tell me that bell hooks isn't one of the most important figures in modern feminist theory and literature, I'd call you a liar. And it's not a mischaracterisation either, it's not exactly a surprise she was writing news articles condemning the Central Park 5 when everyone else was suspicious about what was going on (to her, it was innate to men. Racism couldn't possibly be a factor).

icxb15z,t1_icx91bq,2022-06-19 08:36:18,MensRights,"I'm guessing that's to the last point. So: 

If a couple have sex, and the woman doesn't want to be a parent, she has the following options (many of which can be done unilaterally without including the partner in the decision):
  
* caps or diaphragms
  
* combined pill
  
* condoms
  
* contraceptive implant
  
* contraceptive injection
  
* contraceptive patch
  
* female condoms
  
* IUD (intrauterine device or coil)
  
* IUS (intrauterine system or hormonal coil)
  
* natural family planning (fertility awareness)
  
* progestogen-only pill
  
* vaginal ring
  
If any of those fail, she (currently) has the right to abort up to a certain point in the pregnancy. If the doctors are anything like the ones in the UK, they'll remove the man from the room to make sure there's no undue influence on the decision when talking to the woman. 
  
If she forgoes the multiple contraceptive and abortion options, she is able to give the child up for adoption. In the US, she can even use ""safe haven abandonment"" laws  to abandon the child at a police or fire station, no questions asked. This can all be done without any consent of the father (who may want to be a parent). 
  
Now let's flip it: a couple have sex, and the man doesn't want to be a parent. His options are:
  
* condoms
  
* vasectomy
  
If either of those fail, he is on the hook for 18+ years of child support for a child he didn't want. [Even if the conception came about through statutory rape of the father](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/).

Explain your reasons for tipping the waitress $10 - that in your experience, wait staff have difficult and stressful jobs and that you were simply trying to express your appreciation for their hard work, and that you would have tipped a wait staff who has done a good job regardless of whether they are male or female. And that gender does, and didn't, make any difference you.

Let them know in the letter that their action frankly constitutes something actionable in a court of law. You were reprimanded without being given the opportunity to hear your side of the story, and that you were/are extremely disappointed at the immaturity of the waitress for jumping to the conclusion that you were hitting on her. And no, she didn't assume that you were 'flirting', she assumed that you were hitting on her, otherwise she would not have made a complaint. 

After you send the letter, then you go into the supervisor's office and proceed to repeat the contents of the letter and lecture them for a good fifteen or twenty minutes, explaining to them that they have made a mistake and you are willing to overlook their mistake, but that you expect better behavior from them in the future.

Im a guy and this was a female cashier at the time. We didnt have any stores open for her to manage at the time so while she was being trained to be a manager she was going to be a assistant at some other store until one opened up for her to take over.  


At some point near the end of her training my boss came in and said we needed to talk. I was sort of excited at this point as i thought maybe i was getting a raise finally. We go into my office and she informs me that i had a sexual harassment complaint against me after asking me a bunch of questions about my new wife and I's relationship. I had very recently gotten married. This sorta blew my mind. I was young and recently married and my relationship was awesome. This chic for whatever reason thought i was hitting on her or what i think happened after quitting years later for a better job and getting more experience with shitty people is she thought she could get me fired and take over my store.   


Either way what happened is i had her transferred out of my store immediately. My boss even before talking to me knew it was highly unlikely and had met my wife who was going to school not very far from where i worked. Im not a ugly guy, wouldnt say im super attractive either mostly average, wife is a little more attractive than myself and the person i was training was straight up unattractive (only noting this as seen a comment here where someone said you may be ugly).

There are no rules for life. Using this as an example of why you wont be nice or tip or whatever because ... women ... is garbage.

Your post lacks any context to her reaction or your history with her. Something about your gesture was enough that she had to talk to someone about it.

The $10 tip was not the issue -- it was everything else that caused the situation to be misread in some way by her. You made an error in reading the social cues that she was (likely) trying to politely and indirectly give you in whatever quantity. Rather then coming off as generous or thoughtful, you came across as a creep. Certainly at some point she said ""no that's not necessary"" and you insisted she take it. Or maybe you have made advances to her in the past and she has ignored you because she is not interested.

You are not a bad person for making this error. You shouldn't feel sorry or be sorry for what you did. Your actions prior to the event and your reaction (post) is also normal. But you should learn from the mistake if you want a different outcome in the future.

From your post, I assume that you work at the same place she does. If so, then you know there is an appropriate time to ""tip-out"" your coworkers who share your shift (or whatever the normal tipping practice is for your workplace). You went to work on a day you normally had off so you could approach her and use this ""tip"" as an excuse to engage with her. It backfired badly. OR maybe I am way off and she is pure evil - to that I would ask why on earth would you have gone out of your way to give her $10.

My advise, think more about the cutes she was sending you that you missed. Learn from it. Find someplace else to work, she may gossip to others and you don't want to rehash this. You will likely be labeled ""creepy"" by your other coworkers and find it difficult to recover from that.

Lastly, I don't see how this post is a MensRights issue under Rule 1. or maybe I take reddit to seriously.",eric_in_cleveland,t2_z6eae,-2,0,reddit2

So I was like ""Hey, I could come by and say hi some time!"" and I was freaking out at how funny it is that we are in the same place. She went quiet for days..

Then I got a message from the moderator of the forums ""DON'T TRY AND MEET UP WITH OUR FEMALE MEMBERS, SLIME!"" huh?? I was a shy, withdrawn, anxiety striken Autistic guy who even a quick ""Hello"" and a smile would be difficult for me and I was gonna beef up the courage to do that.. Nope..

You wrote about being a victim of Domestic Violence and facing discrimination by the police who refused to help and threatened to investigate you knowing you were a male victim.

Domestic violence under Australia law:

> What is family and domestic violence

> Any behaviour that’s violent, threatening, controlling or intended to make you or your family feel scared and unsafe can be considered family and domestic violence.

> https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/what-family-and-domestic-violence?context=60033

Discrimination against victims is unlawful:

> In Australia, it is unlawful to discriminate on the basis of a number of protected attributes including age, disability, race, sex, intersex status, gender identity and sexual orientation in certain areas of public life, including education and employment. Australia's federal anti-discrimination laws are contained in the following legislation:

> Complaints of unlawful discrimination can be lodged with the Australian Human Rights Commission and relevant state and territory agencies.

> https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/human-rights-and-anti-discrimination/australias-anti-discrimination-law

> Australia Human Rights Commission: Make a complaint

> https://humanrights.gov.au/complaints#main-content

> What is the scope of the right to an effective remedy?

> Both the UN Human Rights Committee and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination have stated that the right to an effective remedy encompasses an obligation to bring to justice perpetrators of human rights abuses, including discrimination, and also to provide appropriate reparation to victims. Reparation can involve measures including compensation, restitution, rehabilitation, public apologies, guarantees of non-repetition and changes in relevant laws and practices.

> https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/human-rights-and-anti-discrimination/human-rights-scrutiny/public-sector-guidance-sheets/right-effective-remedy

> Duty of Care (Vic)

> A duty of care is a legal obligation to avoid acts or omissions that could foreseeably lead to harm to another person. A breach of a duty of care that leads to harm to someone amounts to the tort of negligence. In Victoria, the law of negligence is governed by the Wrongs Act 1958, and by the common law. While in some circumstances it is clear whether or not a person owes a duty of care to another, in other situations it can be difficult to establish.

> https://www.gotocourt.com.au/civil-law/vic/duty-of-care/

This may be general fraud, as well as commonwealth program fraud as local police receive federal money to provide police protection to domestic violence victims without discrimination.

Australia fraud laws:

> General Fraud

> Fraud can be committed in numerous ways and span the range of Commonwealth benefit programs and assistance available to the Australian community, as well as the Australian taxation system. Because of this, fraud prosecutions are diverse and fundamental to protecting Commonwealth resources so they benefit all Australians. 

> https://www.cdpp.gov.au/crimes-we-prosecute/fraud/general-fraud

Anyone may report crime to the Australia Federal Police:

> Emergency contact

> In an emergency, call Triple Zero ""000"" for attendance by police, fire or ambulance.

> Non-urgent police assistance

> For police assistance where there is no immediate danger or to report non-urgent crime call 131 444.

> https://www.afp.gov.au/contact-us

Australia anti-discrimination laws include Commonwealth Agencies:

> 26  Administration of Commonwealth laws and programs

> It is unlawful for a person who performs any function or exercises any power under a Commonwealth law or for the purposes of a Commonwealth program, or has any other responsibility for the administration of a Commonwealth law or the conduct of a Commonwealth program, to discriminate against another person, on the ground of the other person’s sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status, marital or relationship status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy, or breastfeeding, in the performance of that function, the exercise of that power or the fulfilment of that responsibility.
				   
> Sex Discrimination Act 1984

> https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2023C00003

These may be false accusations manufactured by police as part of an ongoing policy of harassment and discrimination against male victims of domestic violence causing loss or risk of loss including access to children, access to property, equal treatment under the law, etc to those crime vicims.

In Australia, false accusations are a crime. Here is one defense attorney firm offering services:

> False Accusations – s 314 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)

> Being accused of making a false accusation can be a devastating blow to your reputation and future.

> https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/criminal/offences/fraud-charges/false-accusations/

> General Dishonesty Causing a Loss is an offence under Section 135.1(5) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.

> To establish the offence, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that:

> You caused a loss or created a risk of loss to another

> You did so dishonestly

> You knew or believed that a loss would occur, or that there was a substantial risk of a loss occurring, and

> The loss or risk of loss was against a commonwealth entity

> https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/criminal/legislation/criminal-code-act/general-dishonesty-causing-a-loss/

Loss includes suffering, including knowing your child is being abused as a consequence of fraud:

> Loss

> Loss is damage, detriment, or suffering flowing from the act or omission of another. It is once this loss occurs that an action for damages or compensation can be brought. A common example of loss is that arising in personal injury cases. If you have suffered an injury that prevents you from working, then you may have suffered a loss of income. If you win your case and prove that you have not received income for a certain time period, then you will be entitled to compensation for your loss.

> https://www.lawright.org.au/legal-information/personal-injuries/damages-and-loss/

These potentially illegal acts may be the basis of a class action lawsuit in Australia:

Australia class action:

> Class actions are firmly established as a means by which a large group or class of persons can bring a claim in Australia. The amounts claimed are often large, proceedings are procedurally complex, legal costs are significant and adverse publicity may be significant.

> https://www.ashurst.com/en/news-and-insights/legal-updates/quickguide-class-actions-in-australia/

I wish you the best of luck in your search for justice.

This is the attitude of the ""counsellors"" on Mensline. They do not believe that the men that call are victims. 

""About half the men will hang up pretty quickly, says Sarah*, who coordinates the service run by No To Violence, the peak body working with men to end men's family violence in Australia.""

These men hanging up would be the men that are being blamed for the abuse they're facing.

Men need a service to call that will be believed. Not a service that already assumes they're the perpetrators.

fpf966d,t1_fpf6tjc,2020-05-04 04:00:26,MensRights,"Okay, so firstly, toxic masculinity is a smear word and the whole concept of it is a broken one, just like toxic feminism.  When you conflate the actions of shitty or bigoted people with masculinity or femininity you are attacking an entire sex.    It does a disservice to the concept of masculinity and femininity, and also offloads individual responsibility to the responsibility of a ""class"", which is part of the reason why there are some satisfactory arguments to be made that Feminism is modeled off Marxism, but I digress.

Initially you argued that the ""centre right party that puts in place misogynist policies while still harming men?"".  Then when I challenged it, you shifted it to saying that the men themselves are misogynistic.  Whether the individuals are misogynistic (or misandric, as we have seen as well) or not I don't disagree with but it's secondary to the original topic for discussion which is the policies and systemic bias against men.  And for the record, I pretty much despise the entire government in Australia and have yet to see an example of any good and altruistic public servants.

So my first question stands unanswered, and I'll elaborate this time in brackets for further clarity; how is the current system (such as policies and laws and systemic bias) misogynistic?

In terms of (I'm paraphrasing here) the concept of justifying Feminism choosing women if there is a capacity issue then sure, that doesn't surprise me either.  Thus far I haven't seen any evidence that there is though, and even if there were, they are still misrepresenting themselves by claiming to advocate for Equality.

As for some feminists being misandric; there's a bit to consider here.  Who are the real feminists?  The regular people who believe that feminism is about equality and truly care about men and women equally, and call themselves feminists?  Or the one's who wrote and championed the Declaration of Sentiments (1848)?  Or the one's who write the policies and change laws?  Karen Straughan has a great write up on the ""Not All Feminists Are Like That"" defense (otherwise known as NAFALT), which is predicated on the No True Scotsman fallacy.  My personal belief is that if regular people who claimed to be feminists did their research on how/what the three waves of feminism said, believed, and accomplished... They wouldn't call themselves feminists.

I gather that your response to my second question can be summed up in a couple points:  they choose women in situations that are potentially restricted by capacity because they need to, and that doesn't disprove that they are not about equality, and also, the people who claim to be feminists who write men out of laws and policies or are misandric are not true feminists and shouldn't represent the movement.  If that is essentially what you're saying (and please correct me if I'm wrong in my summary as I don't want to accidentally strawman you or put words in your mouth) then I respectfully disagree and do not accept that as evidence that Feminism is about Equality.

These jobs are scarce for everyone, men included.

Men do not bully each other and fight to get these jobs; they use performance and merit to try to beat off their competition, they go for outperformance.

So the fact that even if we assume that patriarchy “somehow created the job scarcity” it doesn’t explain why women behave negatively in that environment because men do not do the same thing.

This is ignoring the fact there is zero evidence that somehow “more top jobs exist for men than do for women” because quotas for women exist whilst they don’t for men, so how is that even possible?

The fact more men occupy top positions is probably to do with more men setting up businesses and corporations than women, so they occupy the chief position of their own ventures.

I know, hand on heart, that I didn't cause or meaningfully contribute to any of this, in fact I've had a hell of a lot of shit and disadvantages to deal with myself, as a man, and I've never blamed women for it (even if I should've).

But the fact is, I'm not responsible for these supposed sexism-induced hardships that women complain about. I believe in the right person for the job, always. I've never been a handsy cigar-smoking 1960s CEO, I've never been a 19th century politician. It's not and will never be my responsibility to make up for that, even if *were* universally true that benevolent sexism is somehow negative discrimination (and not protection or benefit) or that women have always been oppressed, denied freedom, and kept as pets.

So I don't take kindly to suggestions that I should be blamed, punished, or further disadvantaged for it.

I'm a grown adult. I'm responsible for *my* actions. Not that I have a choice in the matter, because nobody listens even if I explain all of the ways I've had potential and decades of my life kicked out of me, that's still apparently exclusively on me to deal with. If I start a ruck at work and I get fired for it then *I* fucked up. I don't get a free pass because ""patriarchy made me do it"" (even if, by feminist logic, *it did*). That's what happens when you're granted a role: you also adopt the responsibilities which come with it, whether you like it or not. It comes as a package deal. You want paying? You want respect?

A minuscule number of women may be strong enough but to maintain a society you need *average* people to be strong enough.

- Less than 3% of truck drivers in Europe — and the world — are female, according to a 2022 survey by the International Road Transport Union (IRU),

That right there is the death of your female Utopian society. 3% is not enough to deliver the food, fuel, parts etc required on a day to day basis.

I'll ask them how I am oppressing them right now. They are usually at a loss for words. I conclude by saying if they ever find the patriarch to give me a call so I can get my pitchfork too.

It's easy to wave your hands and claim oppression but the reality is that white American women suffer relatively little oppression. So little they can almost never come up with substantive concrete examples. When they do they are often non-gender specific issues like sexual harrasment, violence, etc.

If they bring these non gender specific issues up as an example of patriarchy it gives you an opening to share the MRA side of the issue.

Don’t go and pretend like it’s women that are killing all these men. At the end of the day, it’s another man that’s killing all those men. How many times have you seen a women go shoot an assualt rifle into a crowd of people compared to a “man?” You could be lying for all I know about the men dying due to harder working conditions, but fine. Women have a higher mortality rate than men in all domestic violence and sexual assault cases. Girls under the age of 15 have a higher homicide rate than boys under the age of 15. Don’t lie and say more men are victims of sexual assault when that’s a blatant lie. I can 100% guarantee all the women you know have been victims of sexual assault or harassment: your mom, your sisters, cousins, aunts, grandma, any female relative you have. You can go ahead and ask them but do you honestly think they’re gonna tell YOU the truth. Nope, they’ll lie and tell you no, a man has never sexually assaulted them and just feed into this delusion that MEN are victims of sexual assault. If you wanted to say children and young boys(in their youth, meaning when they’re under the age of consent) are big victims of sexual assault then you’d be right. But again, it’s not just women who are sexually assaulting them. Men are pedophiles, just like women can be, too.

frgk6hw,t1_frgilco,2020-05-22 16:04:16,MensRights,"Just gonna leave this here. Not my own comment, so please don't bother replying:


So this is probably pointless but i'll try and articulate to this subs posters what the problem is by using two comparatives terms for the same phenomanae.

Toxic masculinity V Restrained masculinity.

Masculinity is viewed by men as an internal driving force, something akin to a soul though not particularly spiritual.

If a man cannot express emotions because of societal expectations, there's broad agreement this is a problem and bad. The objection people have to the term toxic masculinity to describe this is that it is ascribing the problem to the masculinity rather than the restrictions placed on it.

While the former term casts masculinity, even a subset of it, in a negative light, the latter places emphasis on the restrictions and casts masculinity in neutral or positive terms.

This is why people claim you are shittalking masculinity and/or men. Because that is in fact what you're doing by using the term.

It casts masculinity as something that has to be policed and changed rather than liberated.

&#x200B;

Comparing these two terms for the phenomena being discussed highlights the problems with the term toxic masculinity as well as why everyone other than members of your very particular movement finds it offensive and anti-male. Insisting people don't understand what you're discussing is missing the point, because you've clearly not understood their objection either, and that's because you're discussing masculinity differently. You're all viewing it as a set of gender norms, and they're viewing it as an internal driving force. This is where the ""And you're wrong"" comes in:

There is a wealth of literature for thousands of years on how masculinity is an internal driving force, and the mens movements of the past few decades adopt this view. It is not for a womens movement (feminism) to up and decide to use the term to describe this thing about men in a way that doesn't jive with mens understanding of it, and then expect men to conform to their new usage.

&#x200B;

So if you want to discuss toxic gender norms, use those words. But if you use the word ""Masculinity"", you're referring to an internal driving force, not gender norms. Everybody outside the feminist cult understands this. You're being misunderstood because you're divorced from the rest of the species on how this term is understood, and you're using it in a way that is alien to men. That in itself is pretty ridiculous and offensive, that you think you can just up and decide to change the meaning of a word quite important to men.The problem isn't that we don't know what you're saying. It's that YOU don't know what you're saying when you use the word ""Masculinity"".

As such, when you use the term ""toxic masculinity"", you are in fact referring to something internal to the man and how it causes their problems, not to societal expectations. You are in fact victim blaming. And it's a ridiculous and presumptuous kind of appropriation for you to think you can come along and redefine masculinity and what it means in order to cast it as societal rather than internal, despite almost no men liking your movement or how it behaves.The double standards have also been highlighted, as has how this term in effect demonizes masculinity (Again, rather than the restrictions on it).

All of this in conjunction convinces people you're a hate movement actively malicious against men. I don't take that view. I think you've behaved presumptuously, arrogantly, and with no self-awareness over the term masculinity, that you've not really grasped the nature of peoples objection to your usage of the word toxic in relation to it, and that you're convinced that people ""Aren't understanding"" and ""aren't listening"" rather than wondering ""Am I just being incoherent?"". If you'd wondered the latter, you might have looked into why and realized the problem.

&#x200B;

Again. If you wanted to discuss toxic gender norms, then you should have done that. If you wanted to discuss restrictions on masculinity, then you should have used terminology to reflect that. Instead we got this garbled mess. It's also worth noting (Again), that mens movements have discussed this for a while, so the arrogance and misandry involved in the terms history is there too. If you really gave a shit, you would have read up with mens movements before throwing this garbage around. As a comparison, it's like up and deciding you ""care about native americans"" and then running around spamming a bunch of ideas about them they disagree with and find objectionable, all while never having consulted any.

&#x200B;

fjl2qb8,t3_fduess,2020-03-05 20:06:27,MensRights,"Hate to say this but this chart is a bit misleading, and the title is inaccurate. (using 2019 data below, but shouldnt be too different)

Bottom line: hours worked only explains part of the wage gap. The difference between ""all income"" earned between men and women isn't 56 to 44 as the title suggests.

~~The full time labor force in the USA is 56% male and that is what the number on the chart is representing. That number does NOT account for differences in average hours worked.~~ The fact that men worked 56% of total hours does not account for the fact that there are more men in the work force, and that number includes all workers, not just full time workers.

The difference in hours worked among full time workers is 43.5 hours for full time working men vs 41.1 hours for full time working women. As a ratio this is 51.4% hours worked by the average full time male employee vs the average full time female employee. Full time working men work about 6% more than full time working women (your title suggests more like 27% more)

Among ALL (non agriculteral) workers men work on average 41 hours per week and women work on average 36.6 hours. This number is heavily skewed because of the large percentage of women who work part time. According to the BLS 20M women worked part time compared to 13M men. However, the ""wage gap"" only compares full time workers so these are not the correct hours to compare.

Simply put, you cannot explain away the wage gap with only hours worked, although it is certainly a factor. For a more detailed breakdown of some of the main factors that go into the wage gap here is a write up I did: [http://rollfordamage.net/index.php/2018/04/10/a-guide-to-equal-pay-day/](http://rollfordamage.net/index.php/2018/04/10/a-guide-to-equal-pay-day/)

Seriously. If you could pay women less to do the same work, men would be replaced with women. Its basic economics. The reality is men work longer hours, have fewer gaps in employment, negotiate more aggressively for salary and gravitate towards different competencies than women. All of those things are variables that the wage gap myth doesn't bother to control for and every one is a personal choice.

Also no one went around using their ""power"" to force anyone to hire a male plumber or engineer. It's not discrimination that men and women make personal choices to develop different competencies and its gor sure not discrimination to employ a workforce that is 60% male from a population of applicants that is also 60% male.

If you look at union jobs, they pay everyone exactly the same. But most union jobs are hourly, and women end up working less and therefore making less.

The earnings gap for union work is exactly the same as non-union work though.

You can blame this on child care to an extent but lots of times this is actually the mother's choice; she prefers that her husband works extra (and/or pays child support) so she can stay home and ~~watch Jerry Springer~~ ""take care of the kids"".

Before having kids women usually work fewer hours than men.  Which is fine. It would just be nice if a) people were honest about this, and b) men were allowed to do the same thing without being punished for it.

You're using statistics that include a different number of men and women, and driving them down to a number that really should be average per man or per women. It's extermely misleading.

The problem is the wage gap is the average for women and average for men. Women on average earn 77c for every dollar a man earns. Your numbers are aggregate (and not even true). You're saying women in aggregate earn 77c per every dollar that men in aggregate earn, but you're also not factoring in that men's hours are paid at a higher rate.

You're not understanding why your methodology is terrible. Let me give you an example. 

Let's say there are 10 men and 5 women in the labor force. Let's say the men work 40 hours a week and each are paid $100/hr. The women work 40 hrs/week and each are paid $50/hr. 

The wage gap is the average that women earn 50c for every $1 a man earns. 

Ok but lets use the lauded ""CFOI methodology""

Well the men work a total of 400 hrs per week and the women work a total of 200 hrs per week. NEVERMIND THAT THERE ARE A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF MEN AND WOMEN

therefore the wage gap IS PREDICTED TO BE 50c per $1! dont even bother thinking about the fact that this data is comparing an average to an aggregate!

The data happens to match 77 hrs worked per 100 hrs worked by women in aggregate vs men in aggregate, but that's just coincidence and is an awful predictor of earnings of an average woman vs an average man.

So I'll lay out my understanding of it.  just like ""regular"" intelligence, there's also emotional intelligence right?  Being able to empathize, have sympathy, connect emotionally, be mindful of yourself and of others, have patience, manage emotions, communicate feelings, etc.  So doing emotional labour, is performing tasks related to emotional intelligence.    


This would mean that generally speaking *she* is more aware, considerate, and supportive of his *emotional* state than he is of hers.  *She* is patiently dealing with the fallout of *his* emotions.  *She* is the one who expresses more empathy.  *She* supports him in his emotions and feels like he doesn't support her.  She is mindful of his emotions when choosing what to say (which can often require patience, as emotions can be unreasonable).  And then we can take this and expand it:  She's the only one who provides emotional support to children, who makes them feel seen and heard, who has patients for their unreasonable emotional outbursts.

If a woman suddenly is unattracted to her husband (e.g. he cries when his father dies) she may tell him ""I never loved you, I never orgasmed during sex it was all fake, I never found you attractive"". 

In the moment she will feel strongly that this is true, even if it really isnt. As a consequence she will feel angry for all the times she was nice to him or respectful towards him over the years. Suddenly there is a massive debt of emotional labour which appears out of nowhere seemingly, as history has been rewritten. 

All those times she was nice and feminine were a lie, and fake, and so emotional labour, since you the man were ""never truly masculine"", as she has seen you at your weakest moment.

A woman who is submissive to and in love with her man will never bring up emotional labour. She loves to feel useful to him, it feels incredible. She will want to bake cookies and be soft and sweet. If you try to stop her she will be hurt or insecure. You must allow her to feel valuable for her to feel loved and secure.

Its when she loses respect suddenly everything will be emotional labour. She will resent her husband and saying ""hello"" will be emotional labour as she hates him and is disgusted by him. Being in the same room as him will be enough to anger her.

More likely it's a combination of three different factors.

1) Their primary female role model (their mother) was a stay-at-home mom who was responsible for the management of the household and had ultimate authority over these types of decisions. She maintained a clean house, planned all the family's major events, and was ultimately ""in charge"" of everything. Since she's the person who they looked up to from an early age, this behaviour and these expectations have been firmly ingrained in their sense of ""what's right"".

2) Women's slightly higher propensity for neuroticism combined with their heightened sense of contentiousness causes them to experience elevated anxiety relating to unplanned changes to their schedule or a lack of self worth when things don't go according to plan.

3) They consciously want to be the person in control. It contributes to their self esteem to be the person making all of the decisions, and their self image of being a competent home maker who is taking care of their incompetent spouse makes them feel valued.",FiveMagicBeans,t2_4dan8,2,0,reddit4
jwdrvlo,t1_jwd4hrj,2023-08-16 03:19:54,MensRights,"I'm glad that you and your husband have found a comfortable medium and that both of you have chosen to share the burden.

But this comic still fails to understand the fundamental point that a significant amount of this 'mental load' is garbage that women are allowing to live in their head rent free out of an instinctive desire for everything to be perfect.

To use the comic itself as a decent point of reference... there is absolutely no reason why she can't have the father cooking the food for the children and greet her friend at the door... all it would take is to say ""Honey, can you watch this while I'm..."" and a reasonable partner would do so. She's making a choice (though perhaps a subconscious one) to do multiple things at once for some reason. 

The man doesn't merely 'expect his partner to ask him', he sees the world in a fundamentally different way. The dishes don't have to get done immediately, the cotton buds can get scribbled onto a list that goes on the fridge and be forgotten, there doesn't need to be a fucking -schedule- for when you order vegetables, there doesn't need to be a post-it for paying for bills, or a calendar item for vaccinations, or a mental note that the kids are growing, or that something needs cleaning.

A significant amount of this ""mental load"" is irrational bullshit born out of a need for ironclad control. It's okay to want to carefully plan important things and when a partner feels that they're taking on too much and their needs aren't being met, they need to communicate and establish a consensus about which things need to be planned and which things are just unimportant crap (nobody needs to plan to buy the damn mustard, you just add it to the shopping list and then forget about it until you're going to the store, nobody needs neurotic hyper-vigilance about their selection of condiments, nobody is going to starve to death without mustard).

Spouses just need to work together to establish routines and to emphasize each other's strengths. From a statistical and psychological perspective women are sometimes more prone to negative emotion and far more conscientious than men. Whether this is nature or nurture is debatable (despite this comic's desperate insistence that it's entirely a learned behaviour) but in the end people need to work together as a team as you and your husband are doing... rather than growing to resent each other for perceived slights.",FiveMagicBeans,t2_4dan8,5,0,reddit4
jwbha7w,t1_jwb363n,2023-08-15 18:18:56,MensRights,"Most partners and younger children don't actually care if things have been meticulously planned. They're comfortable just 'going with the flow' as long as the most basic supplies and essentials are on hand.

The women who routinely complain about the ""emotional work"" they're doing are people who insist that they need to keep track of everything and plan things in advance. They do this because that's how -they- would prefer to live their lives (for a number of reasons). 

It only becomes a problem when they insist that their way of doing things (meticulous planning) is the ""right"" way to do things, and then decide they're going to shoulder the emotional baggage of those plans without effectively communicating to their spouse.

The way to ensure your emotional needs are a priority is to communicate those needs to your family... but doing so means that you also have to be open to changing how things are being managed and let go when the rest of the family doesn't share your view. (Most women complaining about ""emotional work"" aren't willing to do so).

Regardless, your point's still valid. There are women who are legitimately doing this for their family, but in those instances they've likely communicated appropriately with their spouse about the work involved, **arrived at a consensus**, and aren't the ones complaining about emotional workload.",FiveMagicBeans,t2_4dan8,14,0,reddit4

However, my personal experience has been much closer to the above comment instead of yours.  All of the women in my life, from my mother to girlfriends to friends' girlfriends to family members, do an unnecessary amount of planning and controlling that everyone around them wishes they wouldn't do.  They make elaborate plans for things that don't need to happen, and then go to great efforts (and put their partners through great stress) to do those things that didn't need to happen.

I don't think I've ever known a woman who ever wanted to give me a break or make me worry less.  More frequently, women in my life will attempt to make me and other men worry more to emotionally blackmail them to get something from them (money, attention, presents, a position of dominance, etc).

You seem to be a person of superior quality, so I think your personal experience has been influenced by the fact that you care about the men in your life's well-being.

The interesting bit is that from what I saw, this decline was for secondary teachers, which tells me two things, that men with higher education degrees have been following teaching less, or that simply, women have gained more openings to higher education, this could mean that women have been getting favored when it comes to those positions, so I think it's a natural process of the old stereotypes about men in education that still persist and women increasingly getting into higher education, not being limited to low teaching positions, like kindergarten and such.",CroissantUser,t2_1424j6,12,0,reddit1

g9b3ecx,t3_jdvb55,2020-10-19 09:16:13,MensRights,"The issue with this article is that it's throwing race and gender interchangeably when they are their own category. Not to mention that this is a study conducted in England, NOT the USA. You have a decrease of white male teachers, but the article then states a rise in minority male teachers.

The charts are also cut to show a more dramatic effect by not showing the graph at zero. It's a trick that people use to portray data in a certain tone that fits an agenda. See this chart:

https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GEsjMbTPiZM/maxresdefault.jpg

And the words used are also strange. It hops the numbers around and doesn't really give you the totals, so it makes you work for it. If I did my math correctly, a drop of 17% would make the previous total of white male teachers at 75,294. Comparatively, the amount of minority male teachers was at 10,451 at the time.

>'The decline in the number of white male teachers is concerning in areas where there is a prevalence of under-performing white working-class boys.'

This quote by the researcher is also very strange. Does he really think that minority men cannot teach or be role models to working-class white British boys? Can men only become role models to boys of the same race?

What I will say is concerning however is the dramatic drop of male teachers in general as the drop of white male teachers of 12,800 still far exceeds the increase of minority male teachers of 3,516. So that part is important.

But the problematic graphs, the strange quote and the lack of disclosing full numbers really makes me feel fishy about articles coming from this website.

I support issues that pertain to men, but I am also critical in how data is presented to the public. The message should be that there is a huge drop in male teachers, but the article flubs around with lots of issues that any analytical person, regardless of their interests would find problematic.",AmuseDeath,t2_6jlxx,31,0,reddit1

Little boys face years of biased marking against them, can do well on tests but still do poorly in a class, and this is the crisis in education.

In answer to your response, its not helpful for this issue of discrimination against men in teaching positions to point out personal experiences that include a small sampling when there is a clear and verifiable issue of widespread discrimination.

I think the most apt comparison would be the discrimination against homosexuals that was investigated years ago in the Boy Scouts of America. What they did was call up Boy Scout troop leaders around the country and have a conversation with them about their homosexual child joining. The vast majority of those they spoke with told them that their child would not be welcome in that troop. It was an overwhelmingly negative response.

That doesn't mean it was universally negative though, their study pointed out that several troop leaders were very encouraging and helpful. Stating they would be happy to welcome their homosexual child into the group. Nothing is ever absolute in terms of social issues like this. There will always be pockets or communities that somehow avoid the discrimination and have a positive and welcoming environment.

But that doesn't mean that the discrimination isn't very real and a very serious issue that the vast majority of individuals have to deal with.

Thing is, everyone I've spoken to who has worked in China for longer than a year has the same story to tell. The cost of living is cheap, the transport system is great, but you dare not say anything bad about their culture no matter how true it is, and there's only so much China you can take before you need a break.

The stereotypes about their driving are true. They're so racist they don't see it as a problem. They believe China is greater than what it is (biased news media definitely helps here).

There's an article written by an expat about the culture and behavior that also addresses why so many expats are leaving:

The guy in the article explains it well. This ideological clash can be mentally draining to a foreigner who must accept that China will never truly be his or her home, that signing a contract is only a mere formality and it's nothing but a piece of paper when it suits the bosses.

Guess what. I'm none of that. And I'm ""white"". Never lived in a house, mother never made over $40k a year and she even got an associates degree in the early 2000s. 

Fast forward to my adult life, I ended up on the floor of my then gf who I impregnated and moved in the day my child was born, I slept on the floor in a 6'x6' space which housed all my allowed space including storage for clothes, a spot to sleep, and a desk for school. I had no job, was a senior in HS dropped out after a month into classes and worked shit jobs. I started from the bottom. I made choices that negatively influenced my starting point. But now? I make more money than BOTH my parents, I finally have my own place after fighting for 8 years. I've been in two long term relationships, the first one from age 14-21 (7 whole years) and the current one from age 22-26 (current, 4 years). I have my own business, I own a $35k truck, I go to college (which BTW I don't get fancy grants n shit cuz there's so much out there for non whites) part time, I work full time. You have to learn to invest in yourself. People are the problem, not their environment. You cannot do the same thing as other people and expect a different result. Einstein calls that insanity, I call it stupidity. 

The funny thing is that ""white privilege"" y'all complain about is that ""1%"" its not a majority of white people at all. If you were in the workforce above entry level and tried to land a career you would find not only being white but a white male is less favorable because dIvErSiTy! You cannot give favoritism to one group and not the other, that's inequality. I showed you PROOF whites die more often in the last 4 years than blacks, our average in a year was y'alls WORST year which happened ONCE. When you hear the term trailer trash you know what I think of? White people. Then Mexicans. Never blacks. When someone mentioned the ghetto its automatically black. When you mention gated communities its always whites. 

I haven't personally experienced white privilege, and I'm 26 and I live in a freaking liberal state where its all about being progressive, BLM, hire minorities, women are victims and not independent but are independent at the same time, the land of tens of thousands of educated young people who have a high unemployment rate both pre and post COVID. 

Do you ever ask yourself why the grass is greener on the other side? I came up with an answer by the time I was 20. 

""It's greener on the other side because it's fertilized with bullshit"" meaning it might look pretty but it's not real. It's astro-turf. Wanna talk about how many athletes are white? They make BANK. The ""white sports"" are hockey, baseball and NASCAR. Yet blacks are playing where the money is at, football and basketball. Predominantly black. By a long shot. Did you know there's companies that exist that hire only women or only black people, its illegal yet its allowed. 

At least when it comes to black people a first racist thought isn't ""i wonder if they're legal"" in reference to Mexicans and people with a Spanish background. Would you rather fear deportation or being accused of a crime when being in the wrong place? For my job, I go to residential areas. You bet your ass the shittiest jankiest places are communities of Mexicans and white trailer trash. Black people are a rarity in my experience in those situations. Black people are associated with gangs, cop killers. Organizing large groups with intent to threaten not only innocent people but government employees is NOT smart. It's fucking stupid. Straight up. More poor choices. 

Now, there are two types of black people. There's ni**as and ni**ers. One is respectable, gets a good job, raises a family and DOESN'T LEAVE, buys a decent car and contributes to society. The other? The mentioned gangbangin criminal. Take your pick. You can ALWAYS change your path. Especially if you haven't gotten involved in criminal activities yet. Not all black people are bad, but you're on the notion ALL white people are bad. You're like a trump hater, orange man bad. At least you're consistent and SO fixated on getting white people to say what YOU want them to say. Don't you think that comes across a little OPPRESSIVE?!",,,3,0,reddit1

That's demonstrably untrue. The anti-women part is completely untrue and the non-white racism part is greatly overstated. The fact that feminism is anti white male is demonstrably true. 

I wasn't advocating mensrights being pro-white, I was explaining why there will inevitably be some overlap of pro-white guys being pro mensrights, and vice versa, when feminism is so anti-white. A lot of male issues are more pronounced in minority communities. 

I'm tired of hearing about race. It's such a marginal issue that you can't even do anything about in terms of policy, yet it occupies so much time and attention. Especially in the US and increasingly here in the UK, thanks to changing demographics. One major reason the US is so fucked is because it's prioritised race over class, it's why it doesn't have a worker's party or basic shit like healthcare and worker's rights.

It seems to boil down to ""hiring a girl presents an additional risk and we must minimize all risks therefore we would benefit not to train or hire women."" Not exactly palatable, or really even a good reason not to hire someone. I agree, ""good engineers"" is more important than ""women engineers"". 

But let's flip this into something that may help visualize. I'm assuming the risk you are concerned about is that your relationship with a young female engineer could be misconstrued as non-professional and she could accuse you of something that costs you your job. I will also assume that, in that situation, you would be the victim of a horrible misunderstanding. It's a bit catastrophizing to assume that it would cost you your career, HR isn't going to side with a woman just because woman. 

But onto the converse of my point: if a woman is statistically more likely to create an issue by raising an allegation, you could look at the reverse and say that men present a statistically higher chance of getting upset and initiating a physical altercation. This is a risk that does not present itself nearly as largely in female candidates (though they are still capable, no doubt) that is a statistically larger risk in male candidates. 

To me, these risks are both so incredibly low that they can be disregarded entirely when it comes to considering if an engineer should be trained or hired.

Nope.  They have no interest in “freely competing against each other.” They just coordinate and price fix, and without governments breaking them up it always ends up being a big fish cartel situation.  Particularly in the US where these cartels are able to purchase the agency of the people regulating them.

>more cost effective services than government monopolies. 

Nope.  Every other public healthcare system in the world operates at cost.  The US system operates on top of the cost-inflated insurance system.  Corporations force you to spend twice as much tax dollars than everywhere else to cover 1/3rd as many people.  And then you have to spend hundreds of thousands of your own money on top of that.  

>The more government is involved in regulating industries, the worse those industries perform. 

Nope.  You live in one of the least regulated economies in the world and private corporations need to be bailed out at the first sign of a problem.

Listen mate white privelege is definetly a thing, in music too especially when you look at the 50's. Yet fun fact Elvis lived in a trailer park in a poor part of America where he lived among black people and he had nothing against black people. If you want to see an interesting video on it watch white privelege in music by Adam Neely.

There definetly was a lot of racism going on in the 50's. R&b being called ""nigger music"" or ""devils music"" just because black people often made it. That's bullshit man, music is music wether you like the music or not. It was often the parents thinking this but the younger generation of teens broke this. Elvis actually did quite a lot to help fight racism because his music sounded both black and white. He was a huge r&b and gospel fan. Sadly there were dicks and there will always be dicks. 

Don't judge a group of people by the dicks in them. If I would do that all black peoe would be gangsters, all white people would be crackheads and junkies, the asians would be totalitarian cunts and all middle eastern people would be terrorists.

People often say white people wearing hijabs, those african necklaces and north african robes is cultural appropriation so it is not a bad example.

Hate post malone, but still he's not racist for just making music he thinks is fun to make even if he started out making folk songs(his songs are still shit agreeing with you on that one). Hiphop is created by black people and I think black voices often sound better on hiphop, but it is not like black people own hiphop and white people need permission to make it, that would actually be quite racist and hypocritical.

I hate braids and baggy clothing personally, but it is people's damn right to do so wether they're white or black.

Frankly it often comes across to me that people think well we have/had bad things happen to us now you need to experience racism and hate. That just fuels the whole race war. The fun thing is that yes black lives matter definetly and yes there's definetly racism going on. But fighting by saying no you can not say that, do that, wear that, make that, have that is just going to fuel hate. Definetly in such extreme countries like America where there is a lot of racism going on.

Frankly if I were to make hiphop and someone would call me a racist I wouldn't give a fuck, but there are people who do and those are going to become more and more racist.
