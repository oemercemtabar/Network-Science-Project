First of all because it was decent to the employee to not feel pressured to come to work.  A happy employee is a much more productive employee and covering their work when one or two were out really wasn't that big of a stretch for me.  The REAL reason was simple math.  If I lose one employee for three days because they have a cold or the flu I've lost 24 hours of production time.  But if they come into the office and infect 3 people who simply can't make it to work then that's 72 hours of potential production I lost.  Oh, and for the record, I never even considered applying a sick employees days off to their PTO.  Get sick?  Stay home.  Get paid.  Keep your vacation time. The company was making millions.

idfkn2s,t3_vigtl0,2022-06-23 14:08:50,WorkReform,"I, along with many others, have quickly realized that the harder they push the “family” mentality, the worse the workplace environment will actually be. They are essentially saying, “hey by the way new prospective hire, just so you know, we want you to think of us like your family for 2 reasons. 1: we don’t want you to quit on us, EVER, for any reason, no matter how we treat you. 2: No matter how we treat you, you must accept it. We are family after all and that means we are bonded and therefore your feelings are irrelevant because you will always be forced into the relationship with us so you can survive.”. Now all that said, that’s not really the scenario for how it just about ever is. All of y’all can walk out that door at any time and find better. I encourage EVERYONE to actively and constantly seek better. 

We’re in a capitalist society where cash and credits are king and almost always rule the minds of the company that seeks to rule you. At any time, they can simply stop caring about you or find you too expensive for their budget and you’re suddenly left scrambling to fend for yourself with no resources because they never paid you enough to have a savings account. So why would you let ANYONE hold that sort of power over you, but simultaneously let them manipulate your way of thinking to their benefit where they are given special privileges? If you answered anything in your head except, “I wouldn’t”, you need to reevaluate your life strategy before you wind up in a really REALLY bad spot.

The pandemic and the newbies just ruined it for everyone. You just have corporate hiring people and they’re so rude and they don’t even speak. They just feel entitled to have a job. And I think a lot has to do with the benefits that are given to them from day one. 

No offense to newbies here, but even the bullseye badges make them think and act like they own the place.  We had to earn our anniversary badge.

The agreement was that they would reevaluate after 6 months. When I approached my boss after the six months, he said I must have misunderstood and the way you get raises in sales was to sell more so you get higher commission. 

When I finally quit, eleven years later, my base salary was just shy of $35,000. I'll save you the math, it's roughly 1.6% per year increase. At my final salary discussion before I decided to quit I pointed out that I was handling 40% of all sales for the company despite being only one of five sales people. At that point I was aware I had the lowest base salary on the sales staff, but I didn't bring it up. Instead I pointed out that I was making less than $75,000 once commission was factored in. I was working at the upper limit of my ability every day, exceeding the performance of every other sales person, and had no capacity to earn more money.

I was given a +$20 on my commission. All that means is I would get a guarantee of $20 per monthly commission check. A $240 per year raise. That's $0.12/hr for their top sales person.

2) if there is a constant turn over baked in, processes in the company are likely to be structured around the idea that people are going to leave in X years, this can result in a better culture of documentation and change management 

3) ending up with long term lynch-pin employees is dangerous to business continuity, it’s better for efficiency and productivity in the short term but detrimental in the long term

4) some times you just end up with rusted on people who don’t want to change with the times, don’t want to try new ideas and just weigh down progress 

5) having fresh blood with differing experience is often just better, you can’t do that if everyone’s been at the same place long term

Don’t think for a second that management hasn’t considered the turn over costs, that matters a lot for low skilled jobs but it’s not universal for all job types.",angrathias,t2_3krgy,4,0,reddit4

A) You are paid the normal amount for doing the amount of work agreed upon, and then you can go home after 20 hours

B) They double the amount of work you do to 2x, which should result in doubling your pay and staying for 40 hours.

kbyzmed,t1_kbygr4y,2023-12-04 16:41:20,WorkReform,"I don’t think it will be popular, but this is a problem in two parts. The first part is that much of academia (not all but much) has become a bit of a pyramid scheme. Many institutions are reliant on cheap grad student labor and entice students into a life of academia for a likely decreasing number of positions, also driven by a shift towards adjuncts and lecturers. This whole system rests on enticing more people into the system, passing the bill onto the next generation.

The second part is the craziness of our credentialing and job placement system. There are way too many jobs that ask for overly specific credentials nowadays. Many job listings ask for too many credentials or experience such that low level positions are subject to boom-bust cycles. This also includes the credentials needed to teach at universities. 

This is just the short version, but I think once you consider these things, it becomes clear how on top of the broken high education funding system is (including student debt), other aspects of the system are as well.

They were told “if you get X degree you’ll get a job paying Y” and they’re missing the entire “entry level” part of the career step.  People don’t offer six figure jobs to 25 year olds with a BA and no work history.  I know we all crack jokes about the “entry level” job with shit pay and high expectations, but I think a lot of students are basically in “school mode” and then get their degree and are like “ok, now I’m in Work mode” and it doesn’t work like that.  They don’t take advantage of networking events at their college.  They don’t take on internship opportunities.  They don’t want to hold a part-time job of any kind while in school.  All of that comes back to haunt them when they are now trying to enter the workforce and they are lacking in contacts/connections to help them land a job.  Most people get jobs because they know someone.  Even when you see a job posted that you think you’re qualified, there might be someone already working for the company, in a lower position, with the same degree you have.

Just my boomer thoughts from someone in their 30’s that has seen this a few times.  A lot of people I know coming out of college pick up a job to pay the bills and it takes them a couple years to finally find something that has anything to do with their degree (if they do ever).

By the post, it looks like he was looking for an academic (research/teaching) position in history at a college or university. His qualifications - PhD from an R1 in history - is the exact qualification they seek for that position.

That said, academic hiring is very cut-throat. Most people with a PhD are aiming to get a faculty position eventually, but most don't. The University of Toronto brags that it has the best PhD-graduate placement in Canada (and one of the best anywhere): just 25% of its PhD graduates get a faculty job. And that's a *world class* placement rate.

I don't know history, so I don't want to judge OPs publication record, but the differentiator between a 'good' and an 'outstanding' PhD can be pretty substantial these days, in the views of a hiring committee. I was hired for a faculty position straight out of my PhD without a post-doc (in physics, which is one of the few fields where most PhD graduates *aren't* looking for faculty positions, mind), but I had more than ten publications during my PhD alone. The average for a 'good' PhD, from my experience now having sat as an examiner on a few dozen PhD defenses, is two or three.

While I got in, I don't want to present the impression that I think OP should 'git gud' or anything like that, firstly being quite ignorant of the particulars of their field. While I hit the minimum bar for my research area, that bar is absurd and inappropriate and not a good measurement of research potential. 10 publications during your PhD also means like likely than not that you had no work life balance, and likely suffered an abusive relationship with your supervisor.

How did you get a job here?"" etc.  People see the end result and want that now.  The Director of an IT department making $200k/yr probably did their days as a field tech making $60k/yr.

I wouldn't discount your daughters experience, everyone has to start somewhere.  If she's passionate about baking or cake decorating then a grocery store can be a good fundamental learning experience for someone with limited experience.  I work at a grocery store and can do nearly everything in the bakery.  Learning how to proof, getting cooking times and temperatures right, textures and colors of finished product, and learning some decorating skills are all good foundations for her.  Hell, even learning how to wash dishes in a commercial setting is all good experience for someone with that aspiration.  I think there is about a year's worth of learning to do in a Grocery store Bakery before the work becomes mundane, but its good experience to have on a resume.  I agree with you that she'll want to do some of her own education, even if its just watching youtube videos and baking bread at home for a few months.  Sadly, none of this work pays well.  Max pay at a grocery store is going to be \~$20-25/hr depending on the area.

kc0tn35,t1_kbzbgf6,2023-12-04 23:26:39,WorkReform,"I think a lot of people over-value a PhD.

To be clear, I don't mean to say that PhD's are not valuable, they can be. It clearly shows you're someone who can commit to a long-term project/vision, and you're very likely an expert in your field.

But when I think about jobs for someone with a PhD I typically think very niche jobs, or something in academia. Unless you're going for that sort of career path I'm not even sure just going straight through for a PhD is a wise idea.

I can only really look at it from a business education perspective because that's what I have, but it's normally not advised to go straight through and get your MBA because MBAs are sort of intended to complement your existing business experience. If someone went and got a PhD in Business Admin (it's a thing) I wouldn't expect them to be seeking a typical mid/upper level management job, I'd expect them to be planning to teach and study business OR they're someone who is already part of the C-suite (or at least director level) and need to expand their education. 

I also think they'd run into the same problems some MBA folks do (when they've gotten an MBA without workforce experience) in that you're over-qualified for entry level work but under-qualified for higher level work. It's very unlikely you're going to land a job in a C-suite without having any actual work experience, but at the same time no one is going to hire you to work in the mail room because you're way over qualified from an education perspective.",Tje199,t2_rp6vg,1,0,reddit1

In a single conversation Boomers/GenX will say that they got jobs with nothing more than ""gumption and a handshake"", but then when it comes time to hire new people they also make job requirements that needs college+work experiences that they STILL don't have any in.

>The games have changed.  


The games have changed because Boomers have setup unrealistic expectations. They require far too much for job requirements, and then in the same breath only pay ""what it used to be"". Boomers have constantly pushed the line more and more and more of their ""minimum requirement"", but never brought the compensation along with those requirements. 

Inflation and requirements cannot/should not be increasing if pay doesn't as well. But since Boomers don't acknowledge how the world is different today than when they were ""our age"", we're going to be stuck.",numbersthen0987431,t2_2ys2ujy0,9,0,reddit1

France simply cannot afford to keep the system the way it is. Only this year already the French government will spend 60 billion euros on interest on its loans. That is money that cannot go to healthcare or education and to keep the pension system the way it is now the French government will need to keep lending money. The only thing France can do so they do not have to raise the pension age is massive spending cuts to the public sector and who wants that.,SkeletonDrinkingBeer,t2_iopbrlu2,-1,0,reddit2

The morale is still high although we're getting financially hit.

10% GDP moved from labour to capital over the last 30 years. That's where the money is. And that's what is generally disregarded. All the productivity gains of these last 30 years went to the fatcats. 

Plus, there are many other ways to fund pensions even with a declining working population : raise contributions, abolish company tax rebates that have had no impact on unemployment as they were supposed to. 

Lastly, pension money is not tax, it's part of your salary that is socialized, and we refuse to see our wages decline and sit silent. I know the EU has been trying to sell its narrative for the past 20 years about aging population, longer life expectancy but that's exactly the point living longer means enjoying longer not working longer. We EU countries have never been richer, gdp cake has gotten huge, productivity has sky rocketed, dividends got insane, so where's our share? We won't accept 64 and we want 60 now and 55 in a 4/5 years time, that's the plan.

Politicization of labor movements (hindering unity of effort).  
Anti-worker/union laws (leading to...)  
Aggressive militarization of police to disrupt protests and restore the status quo.  

You've seen how quickly people turn on protestors once their way of life is even slightly impeded. The culture in the U.S. is the first major obstacle. How do we get around this? Thoughts and prayers?  

We have a large demographic that:  
1. Consistently votes, often in a way that hurts themselves  
2. Constantly punches down on anyone fighting for worker's rights/civil liberties  
3. Has a lot of embedded power and support from the police force and prison industrial complex

Now that that's out of the way, my theory is that it relates to proximity. Workers in the office have more opportunities to rub elbows with the people who influence promotions. Regular small talk in the hallway or while waiting for the elevator, microwave, etc. can leave an impression as to whether you're a generally positive person or negative, for example. It can also build a sense of camaraderie, however hollow and fake it may be in both directions. 

There was one teacher in my elementary school who was really popular. He moved from 2nd grade to 6th grade so a bunch of my friends, my sister, and her friends had him for a teacher. Almost everyone who had him said he was their favorite. I never could raise him to that place in my personal rankings because I was never in any of his classes. I know he was a fun teacher by reputation only, no personal experience.

Again, I'm not saying it's the right way to do it. I'm saying that could be why it is that way.",seashmore,t2_1ikym3yg,3,0,reddit3

Long story short - if a small business can’t afford paying fair wages, they need to raise prices.

If employees have more money, they will spend it. When they spend money, there's more room for more businesses to supply that demand. This drives the need for more employees, who will have money to spend, who... it creates a virtuous cycle for everyone 

What's happened though is the super-rich have hoarded so much wealth there's nothing left at the bottom. Nobody can afford to spend, so there's less and less of a market of customers to sell to

While raising pay will pinch some employers in the short term, they are not to blame. If those small employers need help to survive they should *work with* their employees - lay all the cards on the table, give up control of the business and work together to make an equitable solution.

hxtnq7h,t3_sxqf0j,2022-02-21 12:09:05,WorkReform,"Decisions have benefits and consequences. Economic policy decisions are no different. The biggest issue with the federal government raising minimum wage is the increase in unemplyment and the impact on small business owners. How much exactly these two things are affected really depends on how high the minimum wage is set. For example, raising it to $7.50 would have virtually 0 impact, but it also isn't much help for workers.

One way to approach mimium wage hikes is to have it done on a local and state level. The equilibirium mimimum wage (where supply and demand intersect as modeled on a supply and demand curve) may be way higher in San Franscisco than rural Idaho. If $15 is the equilibirium pay in SF, then making that the mimimum wage would have little negative consequence. However if middle of nowhere Idaho is closer to $8, then a $15 mimimum wage would lead to those consequences.

The biggest setback that has stopped us from simply increasing mimnmum wage is less about evil or incompetent politicians and moreso about the tangible economic consequences.

Only left due to the wanting to move to a different state. Every last one of them paid a wage far above the minimum. Because they know what it's like, they have struggled too. They have to come to work and see how their choices effect their employees everyday. The only thing they couldn't compete with was benefit, but the trade off was well worth it for me. 

I have interviewed with small businesses/start ups that tried to be like the big guys and pay starving wages and to my knowledge most have already gone under. My guess is due to a large turnover, which if you didn't know is really expensive. The cost of loosing a tenured employee is usually greater than what it would have cost to keep them around due to lost productivity, training the new employees, and mistakes made by the new employee. 

Small business know this and the ones that stick around usually have really good retention rates. Most people who make the argument that small businesses will struggle the most have probably never owned or worked for a small business. 

My mom currently owns a small salon, she pays her employees USD$17/hr and splits commissions 50/50. She has had no problem keeping people on, she has been un effected by the ""labor shortage"", they did over $1m in sales last year and things are just ramping up.

When I lived in a small town in Utah, I used to go to this tiny coffee shop, called Joe, that was a bit off the beaten path. I heard about it through word of mouth and I fell in love the first time I went.
The owner was also the daytime barrista and she was a delight to talk to. One of the first places I ever felt it was safe to be gay, honestly.

One year, a Starbucks moved into town, in what I felt like was a better area to bring in business. The thing I didn't realize was that everyone in town already knew about and loved Joe and nobody had any intention of changing their habits. Joe was a hangout, Starbucks was a place to buy mediocre coffee.

That Starbucks only lasted about 18 months. Freeway traffic wasn't enough to make up for the lack of local patrons. And, while this anecdote probably isn't the same for all small businesses, I do think there is something to it in a general sense. People like quality products produced by happy employees, and good wages/benefits inherently produce happy employees. It doesn't hurt to have kind and understanding managers, too.

People see others online and want more, they want a better life, they want to show off to their mates and followers - this is cancer for the human race because it makes people greedy in even the smallest way - they want a new car, a new holiday etc. Because why not I'm working hard and business is going well.

If you prioritise your own wellbeing over your staffs then IMO that's greed, the staff you employ contribute towards the success of the business and should be rewarded as such not just put onto minimum wage.",RemysBoyToy,t2_13jm40,1,0,reddit4

If they answer, ""it wouldn't benefit them more than it would harm them,"" ask them why that would be the case.

The reason is because, through a cost-benefit analysis, the large company has deemed it to be better for the bottom line to keep wages where they are and risk competition from small businesses.

The large companies themselves are admitting that the current ecosystem is more beneficial to them than an alternative one where they pay higher prices.

hxutvg7,t3_sxqf0j,2022-02-21 17:41:55,WorkReform,"“Raising salaries will result in small businesses being priced out.”

- They already are priced out, yet many are still successful. Many small businesses from resellers to coffee shops are paying workers $15-$20/hr right now and they’re still finding success. In fact, they’re often finding MORE success than their low-paying competition. Unlike large companies, small businesses can’t afford to post job ads all the time nor can they afford to constantly be training new workers. Small businesses that pay their employees a living wage typically see higher employee retention and better output from workers. 

So to a small business owner I would say this: on average, companies spend about $5,000 on ads and such to gain employees. It takes, on average, an employee 42 days to become acceptable at the role, translating to inefficiency in that time period. Workers are also their most likely to quit within the first 60 days of employment as well, typically because they’re still searching for better paying jobs. This often means you’ll never see a return on investment from that person you hired. On average, a company will hire 4 employees before finding one that will stick around long enough to be a ROI. 

These statistics largely come down to small businesses competing with market average for compensation. ALL businesses that offer above market value for talent often find above average talent, higher retention (less hiring costs) and better loyalty to the business. 

So paying your full-time employee at $20/hr might seem daunting… statistically, NOT hiring at $20/hr would cost your business annually the equivalent of a single full time employee at $29/hr while you have little to show for it.",Goopyteacher,t2_ayefvt2l,1,0,reddit4

It's your passion project, you work there, you employ your children when/if they want to start there. It's a way for the owner of that shop to allow their children to learn how to work, to get experience to move into better things later. 

If you and your small shop can't afford to pay a livable wage for yourself, then maybe you need to adjust your selling points or try something else to get you where you need to be to be successful. 

If you make enough that you want to employ people outside of your family or friends, then you should be able to afford to pay a livable wage UNLESS you are explicitly transparent in your wages upfront to those who might need a job.

hxv0siu,t3_sxqf0j,2022-02-21 18:26:28,WorkReform,"Well there are a few capitalist fallacies in there we have to work through. 

The typical understanding is that a smaller business (in the same field as a larger business) offers better customer service or quality of goods which is why we pay 'more' at a local business. The instant gratification mindset has kinda proven that wrong, at least when it comes to certain services but if they are equal in quality, cost & service then if the profit ratio is that slim then they as a business owner should be in another line of work.

Coffee is the most obvious example. 

When i go out, it's to a local coffee shop because I'm going for the quality of beans and atmosphere. I pay more than I'd get at Starbucks but I've priced that in. 

Groceries are the same way.

Staples I get at Walmart because their prices are better and it's all the same suppliers. But perishables are picked up at Aldis, Lowes Foods, Harris Teeter or the farmers market when in season for Quality. I pay more, they offer better pay to their workers typically. 

Not really Big Business vs Small Business but groceries are a Large Company game these days.

The point is that the only businesses that anecdotally have piss poor profit margins where Across-The-Board payraises will force them out of business is restaurants. And those have so many other factors in why they can't keep employees or customers, that the pay is fairly secondary.

While I have a conviction that every job should pay a living wage I recognize more and more that it's an extremely complex issue. More unions and stronger protections for workers to unionize would be a great start. UBI has fair arguments for and against.

However, if minimum wage is raised nation wide, every businesses faces having to raise prices to cover the wage increase. And it's not necessarily large price increases. If you're employing 5 people at a time who need to make $5 more per hour, you only need to make $25 more per hour. If you sell 100 products in that hour, you only need to raise the price of each by 25 cents. It's also worth noting that the government has already said that if they agree to raise minimum wage to $15 it wouldn't be effective immediately. It would go up a few dollars a year until $15 is reached. So the poor people would still get a few more years to be poor and they'd have an excuse to not discuss raising minimum wage for years.

The only reason arguments like this are made is the fact that small bussiness owners play on our sympathies. Im not immune. I would happily support a small bussiness over a large corporation but as soon as that small bussiness employs even one wage laborer the distinction between them and a corporation vanishes into thin air. 

Why should any worker and or consumer care a single iota that a bussiness that cant provide a service people want to use fails? On the basis that small bussiness existed once and should exist? Its written in the DNA of capitalism that small bussiness will be burned away by large scale enterprise until only a small handful of ultra powerful corporations are left. Thats a fact of capitalism.

hxwvi2e,t3_sxqf0j,2022-02-22 02:13:57,WorkReform,"The short answer is that the costs of labor, while a big part of running a small business, are just a portion and a  jump in salaries is a small increase in the total costs.  I'm spitballing here, but these are some rough numbers for way of explanation.

Let's say you've got a small business selling sweaters.  You've got two 1,000 square foot stores and 5 employees split between the two stores.  They all work the same hours, and get the same pay - let's say $15/hour and the stores are open 10 hours/day (9am - 7pm).  You, the owner, pay yourself $100k/year.  Retail space is expensive - in SF, it's $3.50-$4/square foot, but let's say $2.50/Sf to generalize things.

Rent = $2.50\*2,000 = $5k   
Business Insurance = $0.5k  
Accouting/Payroll = $1.0k  
POS rental = $0.5k  
Utilities = $2k  
Total non-employee costs = \~$10k/month  
Owner salary = $100k/year = $8500/mo + Payroll tax = $10k/mo  
5 Employees at $15/hour = $30k/mo (includes payroll taxes)  
5 Employees at $20/hour = $37.5k/mo (again includes payroll taxes)  
At $15/hour, the store would have to make $48k/month for everybody to get payed  
At $20/hour, the store would have to make  $56.5k/month.  
Lets say you sell sweaters.   You charge $80/sweater. Retail price is 2x wholesale, so the business make $40/sweater.  
To pay everybody $15/hour, one needs to sell 1,200 sweaters every month, or 4 per hour on average.  
To pay everybody $20/hour, one would need to sell 1,400 sweaters per month, or 4.6 per hour.  
If the stores are open 10 hours/day, that means each store would need to sell 3 more sweaters per day to be able to pay everybody $20/hour and make $100k/year for yourself.",JamieKun,t2_dsrgb5bn,1,0,reddit4

hxwx899,t3_sxqf0j,2022-02-22 02:27:17,WorkReform,"Since you mentioned minimum wage, I think this is being framed in the context of consumer retail businesses. 

If a small retailer cannot provide more value than a big business, either through price, quality, service or convenience—or cannot reduce costs through efficiencies, they aren't as competitive in the market. Under a capitalist system, we should expect them to lose market share to the big businesses who provide more value to consumers, and eventually go out of business. 

But in a B2B context, small businesses are often more competitive than big ones due to the advantages of being small, nimble and focused with low amounts of overhead. 

What does this mean? Minimum wage jobs are going to increasingly suck as they'll be only available from big impersonal corporations that view you more as a disposable asset with an expected shelf life/burn out rate rather than a human.

It doesn’t matter how much our wage goes up, we’re all making less money. Wage increase discussion typically only matter on an individual level.

hxupo6v,t1_hxudgpq,2022-02-21 17:14:29,WorkReform,"I'm not so sure that M4A would actually work the way you're thinking.

Picture for a minute two workers both making $24 an hour, 40 hours a week, so about $50,000 annually.  Worker A works for a small business that currently can't afford to offer healthcare.  Worker B works for a large corporation that also has healthcare.

The take home pay is the same for both workers, but currently worker A has to now go buy health care, so worker A is effectively paid less.

What happens when you insert medicare for all into this picture?

Well, worker B has a larger compensation package currently.  Large corporation is paying anywhere from $500 to $1500 more a month for that health insurance.  Enough people in worker B's position are going to demand that money shift over to pay, and many companies will shift some to a lot of that money over to pay.  

Assuming that worker B only gets a piece of that money, he still gets $3,000 to $12,000 more in salary now than worker A.

This also means that smaller businesses will actually lose even more good workers, because the math gets a lot easier to do on which company is actually compensating better.  It is hard to get details on things like health insurance before actually hiring on.  ""Salary is $50K.""  ""Salary is $55K"".

20+ an hour puts you well above the median income in Florida, where I live. There undoubtedly are people living below poverty and could be benefitted by a minimum wage increase but 20+ isn't a ""minimum"".

I think the point of higher wages, universal income, and universal healthcare isn't how it benefits 'you' specifically, but how it benefits the less fortunate and under privileged. I see a lot of people say, ""Well, *I'm* doing fine!"" That's all well and good, (really), but you need to factor in all the ways your privilege has helped you to be fine.

They are on the wire sometimes with their margins, and it’s made me stop and think for a minute.

In the grand scheme of things, it’s almost to lose lose. If you vote one wag in this country, you’re not going to get any sort of workers rights, wage increases, etc.

But if you vote the other way, I can see risks that if not mitigated properly would kill off a lot of small businesses that are very very on the wire with their finances. If you can’t afford it, then you’re gonna shut down. But other smaller businesses in the area… Are they going to be able to pick up the slack? In terms of both workers and customer base? In a lot of rural areas there simply just isn’t market share. What happens when those low population and now underserved market areas have low/little options?

It starts to become this very big web of changes that is needed, and that’s precisely what I think is working against any angle of the movement - for the bulk of America, point blank, any sort of large radical change is going to be very hard for a lot of people to digest and get behind. Incremental changes are going to be easier to push for and stomach, but incrementalism is going to have casualties that you would only be able to prevent with a larger block of changes and legislation, which people are going to be apprehensive of.

Read the article I took the time to link to and attack my argument, not your strawman.

Sure, raising the minimum wage drastically and suddenly would hurt businesses that are unable to withstand such a price shock.

https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/20/the-u-s-differs-from-most-other-countries-in-how-it-sets-its-minimum-wage/

But maybe the US could try treating our minimum wage like any of the other developed countries with an equivalent government-mandated minimum wage, either by requiring the issue be revisited every year or two by legislators, or tie it to the economy/inflation so workers' purchasing power remains stable. If US wages had kept up with productivity since 1968, it would be ~$25/hr today. It would be bad for businesses to raise the minimum wage that much all at once, but if we'd raised it every year or two for the last 50 years, businesses would have easily absorbed and planned for the extra cost.

Instead, today we produce more, but are paid less for it. Wages don't keep up with inflation, so workers' purchasing power has been decreasing for decades. What hurts small businesses most isn't increased cost from having to pay their employees a bit more, it's decreased revenue from having a consumer base who can't afford to pay for goods or services with poverty wages.",ceglazer,t2_kcx47,1,0,reddit4

The need for the labor is still there, but the people doing the labor are being more fairly compensated for the work they do.

Also like... do you think wages exist in a vacuum? If the minimum goes up, everyone else is going to negotiate better pay as well. Raising the minimum wage is just making sure the people at the bottom are able to meet their basic needs. 

Also the pedantic arguement of -thing doesnt solve 100% of all possible problems so we shouldn't do it- is exactly why social progress has slowed way down. I can fully acknowledge that simply raising the minimum wage will not fix every labor and wage related problem. But its a start.

They are making less than me, paying for student loans, and are 4 years behind in experience.  Don’t get me wrong, I know plenty of people who went to college and are making MUCH more than I am.  If you’re not making at least $100k a year with a degree than you overpaid for your degree.  I also know plenty of people who make over $100k a year without a degree.  The sad fact is that too many people were told that college was the only way to make money.  So they overpaid with the promise that they would make more money just because they had a piece of paper.  In my personal experience, people who did not take out student loans are living much more comfortably than those that did.   Yes, I paid for my car in cash (I personally technically own 3 cars, all paid for).  $2,000 for a car that gets almost 40 mpg.  That allowed me to save up even more money and I bought a nicer SUV for $9,000.  I also own a “classic car” that I got for a great deal because the guy was moving overseas and had to sell it ASAP. 

So again, my message is that some people CHOSE to take on extra financial burdens that they did not have to.  Like my friend who constantly complains that he has no money yet still Ubers to the bar every night.  You can easily save $30-$50 a day by just not going to the bar every night.

Home Office adds them to the list for the store, and it requires someone at store level to action them to have the change occur in the system.

It could be laziness on the part of the person taking the change; sometimes salaried management is big on clearing the price changes screen out, and so some people will action them without printing the new labels, or maybe they just throw the labels away if they do print.

It could be malicious, but it probably isn’t.  You’re right about that part.  I don’t get why the other person thinks this doesn’t happen at Target as well.",-1KingKRool-,t2_143qhj,1,0,reddit4

That doesn’t even make any fucking sense.  If you are poor because you took out a loan for $150,000 and you can’t pay it back then that’s a poor financial decision.  If you think that is “blaming the poor for being poor” then you clearly have some mental handicaps.   I’ll say it AGAIN since you are having trouble understanding… if you have a health problem that is expensive then it’s not your fault.  Now IF I said it was you fault for having medical issues then yes, I would be blaming the poor for being poor.  However I have specifically said several time now that things you can’t control, like health issues, are not your fault.  How bad is your reading comprehension that you think I ever said anything remotely close to its poor peoples fault that they are poor.  I VERY clearly said people who make poor financial decisions end up poor.  For you to assume that everyone who is poor got that way because they made poor financial decisions is fucked up.  Some people are poor for no fault of their own.  They can complain all they want to about it, because it’s legit.  My issue is with people who take out massive loans and then can’t repay them and then they complain that they are poor because they have to repay money they borrowed from someone else.  Or they complain that they don’t make enough money to save money.  Meanwhile they eat out all the time, watch tv, go to movies, go to sporting events… yet I cook my own meals and spend zero dollars on entertainment like tv and sporting events.

Again… I’m not saying there are not people out there struggling.  I’m simply saying that the  “majority” of people I personally see complaining that I personally know  are struggling because they made poor financial decisions.  It can be recent decisions like going to the bar every night or past decisions like student loans or having kids.   I have a friend that I’m tired of hearing complain about being poor.  Him and his wife both made around $15/hr and rented a nicer apartment because they wanted to live “somewhere nice”.  They were doing alright but didn’t make enough to put a lot into savings or anything like that.  They then decided to have a kid.  Not oops I’m pregnant… they intentionally had a kid.  You chose to take on a huge financial burden then complain you have no money?   Some people are poor because life dealt them a shitty hand.

If the other issues that give corporations such a fiscal advantage over small businesses were addressed they wouldn't start off ahead of the game. The playing field is uneven, I get that and agree. Still not acceptable to underpay employees just because you're in ""survival mode"". 

Not everyone has the choice to commute 30 minutes plus for work. A lot of people work what's available. Hell, it's unreasonable to even approach this topic like people even have a choice when it comes to getting a job. I've applied to 75 jobs in the past month. I've received 1 call. I've got a combined 10+ years professional IT experience, 6 years of health informatics, 3 years CAD experience, and I'm a veteran in NC. I think I'm marketable. The reason I stay where I'm at with my shit benefits and sub par compensation is not because I ""choose"" to. I've got a family that needs bread, period. As an employee, are my needs less because I've not invested in a personal business? 

We need a UBI. Existing shouldn't come at the cost of your entire existence but wage slavery is still not acceptable. If a UBI happened minimum wage would likely change with it. Those are mystical things that don't exist though. What does exist are employees exploiting a labor force because they are allowed to. Employee compensation is the only value that has stagnated in the American economy. No more evidence need be supplied to support the argument. Small business owners should be more acutely aware of that than they seem to be. 

Since UBI is not really a thing in the near future what do you propose small businesses do with their employees in the meantime? What do you propose these employees do in the meantime? You said before that employees aren't forced to be at these places. So option 1, all employees leave until fair compensation is provided, business fails with lack of production. They're in ""survival mode"". Option 2, they start paying fair wages to their human employees so they can afford human things, business fails because they're broke. Seems like destiny to me.

If employees willingly leave and businesses fail because of it, that's fine with me. If the issue really boiled down to greedy business decisions by bad ownership, then another new business will gladly replace the failed one. And with better business decisions it can survive.  What I oppose is the systematic permanent elimination of jobs through poor federal policies.

Businesses have to compete for talented employees. My employer has raised it's minimum starting pay from $14 to $17 in the past 4 years. State minimum is $7.25 an hour and no local minimums anywhere in my region. They don't pay more out of kindness; they want to beat the competition for better talent. Gas stations are advertising they start at $12 an hour where I'm at. The supply and demand curve for workers has driven the price up so much that the minimum wage is irrelevant.

You ask the average person in the UK or Canada or anywhere else with single payer healthcare and they'd balk at how much we pay for some things. Child birth being several thousands of dollars? It's baffling to them.

The article about people dying on waiting lists in the UK is a bit misleading given the context of pro / anti single payer healthcare. The article was published in 2020 and mentions that about 5500 people had died since 2016 waiting on a list. Depending on which study you read, between 26,000 to 45,000 Americans die every single year due to lack access to health care (no health insurance). Even taking into the lower number of 26,000, you're looking at about the amount of people who died in the UK waiting on list in a four year span happening every single quarter of a year in the US (26000 / 4 = 6500 Americans every three months). Even taking into account lower number of 26,000 per year and the ratio of UK population to the US population (let's say 5 to 1 for the US having 330 million citizens vs 64 million in the UK), it's still about 5200 Americans every single year who die due to having no health insurance vs 5500 UK citizens every 3 to 4 years. I think objectively that is a better system, even if it still has problems.

I think this is a bigger issue too when you consider that more and more people are being relegated to full time part time employees (got the hours, not the full time status).

I don't know what the best solution would be as the government is going to be limited no matter what solution you implement. I think it would be a far bigger net positive than letting for profit health insurance companies run wild on fees and for profit pharma run wild on medicine.

Paying the CEO $10m in bonuses is a small price for a company to pay to ensure they have enough skin in the game, and enough to lose if the company does poorly. 

To answer your retention question, this would be up the the director of HR, who then presents it to the CEO. It’s not the business of the board because that’s not what a board of directors does.

It is worth noting that this is already how large companies are working. Also worth noting that multinational companies do not really exist. It's more a directed graph or fully owned, partially owned subsidiaries. And it's not done for tax reason, it's done because that's the only legal way to exist.

Like tax evasion, this would be trivial to dodge by large companies because the mechanism to dodge the law is exactly the same as the mechanism they have to use to respect the law.

The only thing this would do is complicated the life of smaller companies with extra-reporting. And encourage large companies to outsource their menial job position, which generally means worse condition for the worker ( being the janitor employed by Big Corp is generally a lot better than janitor employer by Big Janitor Company subcontracted by Big Corp)

hwwq391,t1_hwwnuef,2022-02-14 13:58:16,WorkReform,"The thing is that the landscape for ""contractors"" is very odd. 

There are contractor relationships where it is clear that this is a contractor relationship. If I hire a lawn care company to mow my lawn then, obviously, I hired a contractor. I engaged a business to fulfill a specific need. 

When it comes to corporations hiring contractors it gets hairier and the lines between who is a contractor versus an employee can be blurred. Yes, there is an IRS test for this. However, it isn't absolute. And hiring someone through a third party company and with a contract can make for a successful classification even if you control when and where that person works. 

If I am Apple and I hire Deloitte and I say I want a consultant in my offices M-F, 8-5PM they can place one there. I've directed their work. Officially, however, the mandate to work when and where comes from Deloitte, said contractor's actual employer. 

The easiest thing to do would be to add into the calculation the wages of all contractors. This would be a cluster and some corporations would need to think very hard about who they do business with, but that's a good thing.

At my previous employer, for example, I happened upon a labor law clusterfuck. 

I discovered that our company was contracting a company that employed only individuals with intellectual disabilities. They were doing warehousing stuff, mostly scanning barcodes at first. Then they moved on to actually picking orders. The people who secured this contract thought it was a wonderful thing to ""help"" these individuals. 

I dug deeper because it seemed off, to me. Their ""coach"" was with them all day and he didn't seem like a nice guy. He also drove a Maserati. The workers, on the other hand, were loaded into one of those big passenger vans. Sure enough, though it was ostensibly ""non-profit"" the corporation consisted of this guy and two others (one of whom was his BIL). They basically ""hired"" these folks and didn't pay them. They said it was ""job training"" and they were providing it, transportation and meals for free and thus, no pay. They likened it to going to college. They sold families on the opportunity for greater independence and the ability for their children to work even though many were so disabled they would likely never be employed anywhere directly. And they sold companies on the community service aspect of it all.

Right, there's no one-size fits all, and there's nothing CEO's can do about background worker transitions (i.e., they can't stop people from dying as they age, for example!).  But within the same industry the background %'s should be about the same, and there's always things CEO's / companies can do better to keep employees happy.

>  I would think you would have to get the average for a number of different positions to set the standard and there will be penalties for having people leave 1 standard deviation below the average.

At first before enough data can be collected, if I were on a board picking this, I'd just make a best guess about current retention and tie it roughly, slightly less than, previous year CEO bonuses.  If they excel and retention gets way, way better, that year the CEO will get a higher bonus, maybe even substantially higher.  Then the next year they have to adjust, but it's still a huge step in the right direction.

> I personally would rather see companies get additional incentives for things like offering remote work and childcare subsidies, as well as for subsidizing education and training, especially if it is not related to their current job.

But those are the kinds of non-monetary or low-monetary things that CEO's would need to figure out how to offer because those kinds of things directly contribute to worker retention.  My point is not to tell people HOW to solve the problem, my point is to put it so their pay is directly tied to them solving the problem somehow.  They might even come up with better ideas than you or I could.

> 
> When it comes to corporations hiring contractors it gets hairier and the lines between who is a contractor versus an employee can be blurred. Yes, there is an IRS test for this. However, it isn't absolute. And hiring someone through a third party company and with a contract can make for a successful classification even if you control when and where that person works.

so for this distinction, you can call it ""contractor"" - meaning someone hired to work for a specific company in a specific job, and ""client"" - meaning engaging a third party to provide a service.  

at my last job, we had all 3 types.  we had people who were employed through specialized firms, and my workplace was their client; we had independent contractors - individuals who had a specific set of skills and had a defined scope of work to deliver; and we had staffing temps, who were people hired through a 3rd party to perform company-directed tasks but whose paychecks came from that 3rd party.

>The easiest thing to do would be to add into the calculation the wages of all contractors.

except you can't.  in 2 of the 3 above-mentioned types of contractor, you have a middle man who is taking a cut.  with the specialized firms, you had a contract and purchase order for a specific amount of money, and with the temp services, you had a markup on the pay rate of the employee.  it was only the individual contractor who was the sole recipient of the money paid out by the company.

with the staffing agency, those contractors are told never to disclose their pay rate, because the staffing companies don't want the client companies learning what their markup is.  i'm not sure if it's the same with the specialized firms, but at least there the employees have good pay, benefits, etc.",kaett,t2_3nuxk,1,0,reddit1

so on this, there's a law that any contractors working in a federal facility (meaning people staffed by external companies but hired to work in a federal facility, like a department of energy office) must be provided the same level of pay *and benefits* that the federal workers get.  so if the federal workers get 12 holidays, 2 weeks accrued PTO, and platinum-level insurance coverage for $35 a paycheck, then the staffing company has to match that for any contractor working there.

it's enforced because they are RIDICULOUSLY good at counting their pennies.  the government watches money like a hawk, so if a staffing company takes a contract with a federal agency but doesn't make good on the benefits rules, that company loses their contract.

1. Forgiving loans now, to those who took out debt to get an education, is unfair because they had to pay and scrimp and save and whatever to survive. Basically, if I suffered, so do you.

2. Any future endeavor which was planned and financed on the truth that the student loan payments were going to be a steady income source now go bust. I am not sure what major financing plans are on the back of student loan income, but I would not be surprised if it is actually a lot.

3. If you forgive student loan debt, it further incentivizes education. The more educated a populace, the less likely you can manipulate them (ideologically, financially, etc).

4. Forgiving student loan debt is essentially socialism, and didn't we fight a bloody world war to kill socialism? (Even if untrue, would be used as a reason).",ItsShiva,t2_62ua9,46,0,reddit2
iw0zxep,t1_iw0hj5m,2022-11-12 02:33:08,WorkReform,"Legally, the reason is that the president is overstepping his authority by forgiving loans. Which, if it was true, Biden wouldn't have done it, as part of the reason he took so long was because his team was researching the legality of doing it. There's a reason this didn't get struck down sooner, and that is because legally speaking debt cancellation doesn't hurt anyone and people against it couldn't find a reason other than ""because I hate it"" to justify why it should be struck down. The judge in Texas made up a bullshit reason and is hoping the 6-3 super conservative supreme court will go along with the bullshit and kill it, since they only need 5 of the 6 to say yes. Technically speaking, we have already seen the supreme court do this with the backpedaling of the precedent set by Roe vs Wade, using bullshit reasoning that makes other rulings protecting contraception, same sex marriage, and interracial marriage potentially null and void, possibly making all of those things illegal again if another court case were to be brought up to question it. Trump winning 2016 was immeasurably damaging to the country, and it was reasonable for a lot of people being upset he won. Oh, the judge that created the bullshit reason to strike down student debt forgiveness was appointed by Trump too.

They are seen as a stable investment platform like mortgage backed securities. If the administration is willing to forgive the loans then all the investors will lose out on their interest payments.

Now these investments came out of a need to keep the loans profitable, as before 2008 mortgage backs were not possible, banks were selling off mortgages like they were hot dogs. People would have their mortgage bought out from under them so many times they didn't know who they owed money to. Many of these institutions were made so the big banks could shed debt without having to worry about it anymore, but they kept floundering because their money to buy mortgages would dry up before they could make payroll and taxes. They did a similar thing with student loans, but there was a lot less turmoil around them. So to answer that problem loan backed securities were made. Now the billions of dollars invested into those securities would be made worthless if the loans were forgiven.

Just saying well they are greedy and evil is letting them off easy because it does nothing to contribute to a plan to confront them or reign them in in any real way.

I wasn't going to take the time to explain this but according to you *I'm* the one who doesn't know what they are talking about.  This was set up to be easily denied as to appease Wall Street donors and to get midterm votes.

Here's the thing; Biden's team wrote this up stating that the legal footing for this forgiveness is entirely based around emergency covid relief. This is important because the reasons Biden gives for this debt relief in his speech are different and related to long term problems w/ tuition finance. He only briefly mentions covid as a small factor in the overall issue of education finance. It's also worth noting that within the same week he said he's going to have this debt relief Biden declared the covid pandemic over. 

His team wrote it up this way knowing any conservative court would be able to easily strike it down and say it's unlawful and arbitrary as the covid pandemic is over (as declared by Biden himself) and doesn't fit the justifications Biden has given in his speeches for it. 

If they wrote this up differently, for instance using the ""Higher Education Act,"" then the reasons given would have more merit and the courts wouldn't be able to dismiss it as unlawful as easily. That act is not just limited to emergency relief, it's about higher education and finance as a whole which fits Biden's reasons that he gives in his speech.

This is the exact same playbook they used for the extension on the eviction moratorium. They wrote it up so weak and full of holes that they can virtue signal they are working for the people knowing full well that it's going to be struck down. This is also the same reason they never codified Roe v Wade; they used this as leverage to get midterm votes knowing that they'll ultimately not have to actually do anything.

Keep in mind this type of scrutiny only goes one way - only when it's beneficial to the working class. They never had this type of intervention when it came to millionaire PPP loan forgiveness. It was kept quite and processed quickly without any media attention. 

This isn't a left v right or dem v rep issue. This is a class issue. Both the Dems and Reps are bought and owned by the same ""donor"" class which are the billionaire oligarchs. Wall street and private bankers don't want student loan forgiveness; and coincidentally it just so happens to be that one of Biden's, and the Democrats as a whole, largest donors are the billionaire bankers.

I decided to change career paths at one point. So I thought it would be a good idea to go to college for a second degree in my newly chosen field. 

When I began attending I was quite upset at the curriculum, or lack of one. 

70% of my grade was attendance. 

If you showed up and interacted normally you got a 70%. Even if you failed every single test, even if you didn't do any homework.  

However, the teacher would read you the answers during the tests, so not exactly hard to pass them.

I inquired about this because, wtf? 

I was told that it's because they polled local businesses, what the most important thing was for their employees. 

They almost all said attendance, showing up on time and being there. 

So that's what the school decided to teach.

The wealthy businesses couldn't understand that people won't show up if it's not worth it, they didn't understand that pay was the issue. 

The poor should show up and be grateful that these job creators allowed them to exist. 

It doesn't matter that most of them paid $10 per hour. 

Businesses were expecting the public college to somehow instill attendance as being important into their students at the expensive of ability.

I did of course file a complaint about it, I was then told it was not my place to tell them how to teach and was promptly disregarded by the dean. 

Point is, the wealthy are INDEED, that stupid. They don't have complex decision making, they aren't smarter than you. They're mostly unskilled, lucky people who just happened to be in a better position financially and use their positions to make more money at the expense of others. 

They lack the ability to have empathy in many cases and cannot imagine that maybe they didn't earn anything.

Arkansas just made child labor easier, and that's a good thing
by Washington ExaminerMarch 19, 2023 09:00 AM
Most successful adults began working as teenagers.

Perhaps they delivered newspapers or manned the till at a McDonald's. Perhaps they spent weeks in the summer detasseling corn or their Saturdays directing cars into parking spots before college football games. But whatever they did, all those people who worked as teenagers learned at a young age an important lesson for adulthood: that they needed to work, earn, and be responsible for making their own way in life.

BIDEN ISN'T EVEN TRYING TO SECURE THE BORDER

Arkansas's Republican legislature and governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, should be commended for passing a bill that makes it easier for teenagers, 14- and 15-year-olds, to work.

Several liberals are freaking out over the new law, but it is or should be a model for national child labor policy. This is not about sending 8-year-olds into coal mines. The law brings Arkansas into line with several other states, not all of them Republican. Colorado, for example, has a similar law, as do Arizona and Texas. Many states require permits for 14- or 15-year-olds to take part-time jobs. But it is not obvious how these permits benefit the teenagers in question.

It is sometimes claimed that permitting allows a state to verify each child's age, but birth certificates already do this. Moreover, any prospective employee who can write his or her birth date on a permit application already has to put the same information on the federal W-9 tax form. There is nothing magical about a state permit application that makes it impossible to lie or makes one's age official — it's just one more redundant piece of paperwork that irritatingly slows legitimate hiring.

In the absence of compelling evidence of abuse, it should always be assumed that parents know better than bureaucrats what is best for their children. Parents already have the freedom to bring children of those ages on to airplanes without any identification, which could result in far worse outcomes than letting them work a few hours at Walmart for $14 an hour. If parents believe their 14-year-old is ready to work a part-time job, the government has no business intervening.

Meanwhile, in Arkansas, it remains illegal to employ 13-year-olds, just as it was before. And 14- and 15-year-olds are still limited, as they were before, in the hours they can work.

Today's teenagers spend too much time on social media and too little growing up. Anything reasonable that a state can do to make it easier for them to work is welcome. The labor shortage makes this a great time for teenagers to enter the world of work. The market for low-wage service workers isn't as tight as it was at the height of the pandemic, but youngsters can command higher wages today than they could at any time before 2019. College is expensive, and teenagers benefit from sharing responsibility for paying for it.

Not only is work experience valuable per se, but the wages teenagers earn can be among the most valuable of their lives. Believe it or not, the time value of money means young workers who can save their earnings have a chance to build a lifetime of financial security from their summer jobs. Based on the historical average return of the S&P 500 stock index, every dollar that a 14-year-old contributes to a Roth IRA today will be worth a tax-free $161 when he or she turns 65. So a teenager who can sock away just $7,000 from summer and part-time jobs can expect to have about $1,000,000 to retire on, not counting any savings as an adult.

Here's the full text:


""Arkansas just made child labor easier, and that's a good thing

by Washington Examiner

March 19, 2023 09:00 AM


Most successful adults began working as teenagers.

Perhaps they delivered newspapers or manned the till at a McDonald's. Perhaps they spent weeks in the summer detasseling corn or their Saturdays directing cars into parking spots before college football games. But whatever they did, all those people who worked as teenagers learned at a young age an important lesson for adulthood: that they needed to work, earn, and be responsible for making their own way in life.

BIDEN ISN'T EVEN TRYING TO SECURE THE BORDER

Arkansas's Republican legislature and governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, should be commended for passing a bill that makes it easier for teenagers, 14- and 15-year-olds, to work.

Several liberals are freaking out over the new law, but it is or should be a model for national child labor policy. This is not about sending 8-year-olds into coal mines. The law brings Arkansas into line with several other states, not all of them Republican. Colorado, for example, has a similar law, as do Arizona and Texas. Many states require permits for 14- or 15-year-olds to take part-time jobs. But it is not obvious how these permits benefit the teenagers in question.

It is sometimes claimed that permitting allows a state to verify each child's age, but birth certificates already do this. Moreover, any prospective employee who can write his or her birth date on a permit application already has to put the same information on the federal W-9 tax form. There is nothing magical about a state permit application that makes it impossible to lie or makes one's age official — it's just one more redundant piece of paperwork that irritatingly slows legitimate hiring.

In the absence of compelling evidence of abuse, it should always be assumed that parents know better than bureaucrats what is best for their children. Parents already have the freedom to bring children of those ages on to airplanes without any identification, which could result in far worse outcomes than letting them work a few hours at Walmart for $14 an hour. If parents believe their 14-year-old is ready to work a part-time job, the government has no business intervening.

Meanwhile, in Arkansas, it remains illegal to employ 13-year-olds, just as it was before. And 14- and 15-year-olds are still limited, as they were before, in the hours they can work.

Today's teenagers spend too much time on social media and too little growing up. Anything reasonable that a state can do to make it easier for them to work is welcome. The labor shortage makes this a great time for teenagers to enter the world of work. The market for low-wage service workers isn't as tight as it was at the height of the pandemic, but youngsters can command higher wages today than they could at any time before 2019. College is expensive, and teenagers benefit from sharing responsibility for paying for it.

Not only is work experience valuable per se, but the wages teenagers earn can be among the most valuable of their lives. Believe it or not, the time value of money means young workers who can save their earnings have a chance to build a lifetime of financial security from their summer jobs. Based on the historical average return of the S&P 500 stock index, every dollar that a 14-year-old contributes to a Roth IRA today will be worth a tax-free $161 when he or she turns 65. So a teenager who can sock away just $7,000 from summer and part-time jobs can expect to have about $1,000,000 to retire on, not counting any savings as an adult.

Employer is making not only a massive product line off the backs of teen and young adults but also saving 2000$ for every 90 day training period they force these kids under! 
Let that settle In
So how is making 34$ a day w out taxes in these economic times going to amount to any kind of pay check for these kids!  170$ a week w out takes  working 5 days a week w 8 hrs each day which is during summer as kids can’t legally work this amount during school days in most states. 
So depending on the taxes being taken out they will make about $150. A week 
Now let’s say this KID is one that is now 18 and has a child to support and because of these law as and added abortion laws, how in the hell could they afford to live at all let alone the child they bring in….. 
so more homeless youth and young families seeming employers can force anyone under 20, which at 18 can have own place, at 14 in some states can get married, but aren’t going to get paid any where close to a living wage.

Every Saturday afternoon I would bike about 4 miles and clean out the cases of an old style butcher shop, wash them down and then I swept and mopped  the floors. All together it would take me about 3 hours for which I made $15.00 and an awesome bologna sandwich. This  was 50 years ago. My father worked their as well on Saturdays slicing deli meats for customers. It was the only job my father had at the time. I gave my father my earnings and I would get a $5 per week allowance. $5 was a lot of money for an 8-year old 50 years ago. The $10 my father got probably went towards groceries. You see my father was out of full time work at the time. A lot of fathers were at that time in my neighborhood. My mother was a bookkeeper and didn’t make much money. So is child labor a bad thing. I don’t think so but it depends on the circumstances. Corporate exploitation of children can be precarious and unsafe for kids but neighborhood and family/friends businesses I could see to be OK.

Of course some young people have no choice but to get jobs like that in order to not starve, and if you keep it part-time working while in school isn’t the worst thing.

On the subject of wages, I was a youth supervisor for a while, helping organize weeding of organic crops. The company hired teenagers for some of that during the summer, and took a financial hit for it, because they worked at about 1/3 to 1/2 the speed of adults, but got paid the same.

> Anschutz prefers to stay out of the limelight.[55] A member of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church, he is a conservative Christian.[56][8][57]  
  
> Anschutz is the son of [Fred and Marian Pfister Anschutz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschutz_Family_Foundation). In 1961, he bought out his father's oil drilling company, Circle A Drilling, and earned large returns in Wyoming

  
> Anschutz supported the Parents Television Council, a group that protests against television content that they consider indecent.[38] He also financed and distributed films with Christian themes for mass audiences (through his two film production companies and ownership of much of the Regal, Edwards and United Artists theater chains) including Amazing Grace and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.[39] He financed The Foundation for a Better Life. In 2009, Anschutz purchased the conservative American opinion magazine The Weekly Standard from Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.[40] In 2010, he financed the pro-charter school film Waiting for Superman.[41] In 2012, he financed the pro-parent trigger film Won't Back Down.[42]

> Anschutz has donated to conservative causes and groups that are anti-LGBTQ and anti-abortion.[43] He is also a major donor to the American Enterprise Institute, the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, conservative think tanks.[44][45][46] Anschutz contributed $1 million to conservatives during the 2016 U.S. elections, and $200,000 to Republican politicians and political action committees during the 2017 elections.[47]

> In 2006, a lawyer for Anschutz wrote a letter to President George W. Bush's White House Counsel Harriet Miers recommending Neil Gorsuch to the newly vacant seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit after The Denver Post reported that Gorsuch was not actively being considered for the vacancy.[48][49] 
 
He also owns Coachella, interestingly enough. 
 
> The Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) is a sporting and music entertainment presenter and a subsidiary of The Anschutz Corporation. It is the world's largest owner of sports teams, sports events, and sports venues. It is also the owner of entertainment venues and under AEG Live the world's second-largest presenter of live music and entertainment events after Live Nation. Through AEG Live, it owns the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. 
 
And the railroad he owns: 
 
> Anschutz has had several other business ventures, including Forest Oil, Pacific Energy Group, Union Pacific Railroad (he is the company's largest shareholder, with a 6% stake), and the Regal Entertainment Group, the second largest movie theater chain in the world, with approximately 7,000 screens. Anschutz owns more than half of the company, and multiple newspapers and media groups.
 
> In 2016, the Union Pacific Railroad Co. was named as a defendant in a lawsuit seeking cleanup of a contaminated rail yard site that operated in Lafayette, Louisiana, from the late 1800s until the 1960s.[97]

> In 2020, Houston residents living near a Union Pacific Railroad Company rail yard filed lawsuits against the Union Pacific. These lawsuits followed the finding by the State of Texas of a higher-than-expected incidence of certain cancers in residents living close to the yard.[98] A State of Texas report released in 2021 identified an additional cancer cluster of lymphoblastic leukemia in children.[99]

There are very few for-profit businesses that hire disabled workers under that provision.  

Sheltered workshops exist as a social service for the disabled for the most part.  Not as a profit making endeavor. Because usually the work being done in a sheltered workshop can be done by a machine for 1/10 the cost.  The social services are the point, not a side impact.

Most of these people are on disability and are only able to work in the most Limited circumstances. Studies suggest that occupational activities are a net positive for their well-being.   

You get them out of the nursing home or group home for a couple of hours a day, you set them up with a group of people they can interact with as friends and you give them a sense of achievement for doing something.   

The fact that they are being paid something is for their well-being, because otherwise it would be a group arts and crafts activity.  

Typically these companies are operating with a grant that subsidizes their operations to begin with because they are providing social services. 

The notion that sheltered workshops are exploiting the disabled if they don't pay minimum wage is misguided. 


With that said, I'm not saying that the exception can't be abused by private employers, but as an attorney that handles cases where disabled people without families are in the guardianship of the state, I've not really seen that.",BigBennP,t2_bf6pl,1,0,reddit3

That is actually quite good to hear. I hope that is a more common opinion out there. :)

>There will always be those guys who are just itching to kill someone

Mhmm. I am actually Australian. Which is relevant because a well known YouTuber (Friendlyjordies) made a video just showing how some people in the Australian Defence Force, or were formally in the ADF, bragged about war crimes and killing. Deeply unsettling things, which the video made in part since we are currently prosecuting a whistleblower who exposed war criminals and Australian war crimes in Afghanistan. Yet on ex-ADF accounts on various social media platforms you could find people bragging about lying to committees and shooting people laughing about it. While basically having really shitty Andrew Tate like personalities. Like scum of the Earth types... And I think that comment section was a total warzone (ironic), because these poor mans Tate simps were raiding the comments and calling everyone ungrateful and unpatriotic... Even tho most, including Friendlyjordies... Clarified that they don't hate people who served.

Australia doesn't have the ""thank you for your service"" culture, but these cretins seem to think they deserve such an honour. Mate... If you did everything you admitted too... The military hangman should be brought out of retirement from 1945. (Directed at the bragging war criminals)

>I appreciate your outlook that it’s an establishment problem and not the people who are just trying to find a means to better their lives

It always has been. <3

If you are raised in such a heavy propaganda environment, as we do in the west. I cannot blame someone even one person, for falling for it. Recently... As in the past year or so, like since Ukraine. There has been a suspiciously higher amount of ADF ads on social media and TV. And the way things are going in the Indo-Pacific... I know that many young people around my age who have been tricked by this extremely effective propaganda campaign against China (clarification in a bit), and it is likely many wouldn't take that much to be made into soldiers. Even when nationalism in Australia is about how much beer you can drink in a minute in one sitting. Which isn't to ignore how glorified the ANZACs (Australia New Zealand Army Core) are in our culture.

What the tale I get from learning about the ANZACs is just how bad war is. In WW1 we were sent in row boats against Turkish machine guns at Gallipoli, in which none of the first wave survived... And after the war, the opposing General who was at that point literally the president of Turkey, made great accommodations to respect the dead of both sides. And as for WW2, you get phrases from both sides along the lines of:

""If I was to take hell, I would send in the Australians to take it, and I would use the New Zealanders to hold it."" - Erwin Rommel

Not the exact quote but it was essentially along those lines.

Which throughout all of Australian military history is a sense that we are greatly respected by foes and allies alike. Which reads to me... Not as our greatness... But  as mutual empathy. Respect for all who fight. WW1&2, Korea, Vietnam, etc.

This is part of the propaganda here. But still... It is noticeably anti-war. It's not the young and foolish boy's fault that he was told he would get to go on an adventure... It's the old and bitter's fault for sending him in the first place.",Sir_Admiral_Chair,t2_dfdwb2jl,7,0,reddit3

Unfortunately, some companies specifically request we don’t give the exact “cap” on the salary range they’re willing to compensate for (or even give a range, period) because, and I quote, “they don’t want someone to apply for the job solely for the money”.

Like, I’m sorry that people need a living wage, Carol from HR?

Either way though, I’m upfront with anyone I talk to about salary expectations and even if I can’t give the exact range for a company’s salary in some cases, I can at least still ask them what their targeted range is and confirm if it’s doable for the company or not. It’s stupid that we have to do it like this… but what can ya do.

I recently had a recruiter reach out about a full remote director gig. No salary range posted. But they included a ""sample"" salary if the person who accepted the job was located in Kansas. I said to the recruiter that my salary expectation has nothing to do with where I live. There is a market rate for my role. That's the market rate whether I live in San Francisco, NYC or rural Kentucky. My market rate is based on what salary is necessary to hire someone with my skills and experience, not based on what you think that buys me wherever I live, thanks. 

Recruiter goes along with it. I say my requirement is $110k. They say cool. I do the interview. I go through three rounds of interviews. Then I get a rejection along with an invitation to email the hiring manager if I wanted to discuss anything. So I reach out, ask if there is anything I could have done differently, and I get back ""Oh no, you were great and everything we were looking for. But we really can't pay more than $70k.""

Indeed. Nothing prevents any country from judging any people. Albania could try a Scottish guy for being too gay if they wanted. Of course, judging someone is useless if you can't enforce your decision, so countries only give themselves these powers when they can reasonably expect to enforce them.

I remember a few years ago Argentina tried _in absentia_ a few Spanish citizens for their actions during the Spanish dictatorship (1939-75). Some people were confused as to how Argentina could simply do that. The reason why is that Argentina gives itself universal jurisdiction to judge crimes against humanity commited by any person anywhere in the world (iirc), so as a mostly symbolic gesture they prosecuted people that Spain refused to prosecute. Of course Spain didn't give a fuck so no one was jailed or anything.",elveszett,t2_ffi8w,1,0,reddit4

Instead of me versus them and their child, it was us versus the issue at hand.

The other stark difference was that the administration was very supportive of the staff. We were paid very well (most of my coworkers were able to make big dents in their student loans while working there. I rarely had to purchase classroom supplies from my own pocket, and those I did were because I wanted to be able to take them with me when I moved on.

I think charter schools have a bit more discretion and less financial oversight, but still… you can’t just move money from one fund to another, or use money from one fund to pay the balance in another. In my experience as a teacher who had to manage a handful of school accounts, whoever was making a donation would just make the check out to whatever fund they wanted it in (ie science department), then it would get deposited there, then anyone spending any money from that fund would have to get approval for purchases ahead of time and provide itemized receipts to demonstrate that it was used only for its intended purpose. Admin wouldn’t be able to, like, move it to the football account without getting approval…

And the few times the voters tried to pass taxes specifically targeted to try to improve teacher wages the school board had the measures written so that the administrative staff (that was already overpaid) also got all the same salary % increases which meant less money for teachers.,Degenerate-Implement,t2_is23wnj8,1,0,reddit1

Second was secular private academies - not all are for the ""elite"", some are simply trying to be really good schools, with or without a particular educational theory that's notably different from the mainstream.

Have to think more though, who are the only people who can run for local government? Rich people, because it doesn't pay anything. Hardly anyone can get off the days with limited PTO.

Doctors screw up, politicians cheat, priests get involved in scandals, etc. and that all makes a bad name for the professions as a whole. We can respect individuals but not professions which is perhaps not a bad thing.",drmariomaster,t2_4lbk1hd1,1,0,reddit1

The whole point of this sub is work reform, not work alternatives. Public education also has massive union involvement, which again is part of the core philosophy of this sub.

Additionally, if someone is passionate about teaching and considering it as a career but cannot withstand the challenges of the public sector, both those inherent to the field and those caused by political malfeasance, then I would suggest they find a different career path.

NM is known for bad educational outcomes. Here, people say ""Thank god for Mississippi,"" because they're usually the worst in things like education and poverty, and we're just ahead of them. Retaining teachers and attracting new ones could help, and higher salaries could support that. Of course, that alone wouldn't solve the problems here.

As far as cost of living I'd question that a little. Rent and housing has been high in cities for a bit and it exploded right before COVID. It continues to increase.

hyloytw,t3_t26dou,2022-02-27 03:54:55,WorkReform,"Where we live in western WA (not Seattle) teachers make a lot more than they seem to elsewhere. 

My neighbor retired at 25 years, was making $108K plus benefits, and was due for another double-digit raise. Due to personal circumstances and lack of tolerance for Zoom teaching during the pandemic she didn’t make it to the next year and the raise. While I know she worked hard, I also critiqued her masters work and was shocked at the lack of critical thought in her work, and at her inability to structure a paper at all. Regardless, I know she was great at her area of expertise, which is ultimately the important issue. 

While teachers in some areas have a good reason to fight for higher salaries, be sure you are not alienating your taxpayers by crying poor if you are not for the area in which you live. A huge portion of taxpayers here make much less with the same credentials for their lines of work, the quality of education here needs to be better (not blaming the teachers for all of that), and we are sick to death of the never ending demand for more money for teacher salaries.

So the metrics are just don't get fired.  Same metrics as US healthcare, defense, everything that is under government control: expenses keep rising faster than other countries, performance keeps falling behind other countries.  

I don't really care if teachers could make $1m per year if they actually performed well.  In countries where people take education seriously, like Korea, a superstar educator can reach millions of students and earn huge amounts of money.  But that's private sector stuff.  
Education debate in the US is mostly about money, teachers salaries, and who can use what bathroom.  It's really pathetic how unimportant education performance is.  That's everything though, Americans have 3rd world mortality rates for kids and mediocre healthcare and just whine about paying more than anyone else on the planet.

Example:  Good friend is a high school English teacher.  His commute is 45 minutes each way, so that's an hour and a half of his life lost before he even gets to school.  He leaves his house at 6:15 M and arrives around 7:00 am, giving him 15 minutes to get his stuff together before home room starts.  He is on the clock from 7AM-4PM, with one hour lunch break that isn't really a lunch break because he doesn't get to leave the classroom, and it also doubles as his planning period, so that's 9 hours of being there.  He stays another 2 hours, 1 hour for literature club once a week, and other stuff like grading papers, departmental meeting, etc.  He drives home around 6PM, gets home, cooks dinner for his wife (she hates cooking and has been stuck working from home *and* watching their kids all day - the new norm is dual incomes since a single income cannot afford a mortgage) and then grades papers or does class prep work again for another hour.

That's 12 hours a day during the week days.  Some days he doesn't have to stay after for departmental meetings, and he'll go home early and grade papers there.  Other times he has to spend weekend hours grading papers.  

When you have 200 students, and they are writing essays, half of your work time is devoted to reading those essays and writing feedback.  If he had a reasonable number of students (like.... *half* that number) he could spend a lot less unpaid time trying to keep up.",katarh,t2_rcz3v,1,0,reddit2

Dallas ISD back in the 90s when I was a teacher only paid $1,500 a year more for a masters degree.  And, I'd argue that a degree beyond a bachelors is somewhat pointless for teaching K-12.  Even teaching 12th grade, a teacher with a bachelors is already guaranteed to have four years more education, including two years of focused subject-area knowledge in the subject they're teaching, than any of the students.

hynjhu5,t1_hyni7wd,2022-02-27 15:34:33,WorkReform,"I like a plan where we test every student after 8th grade.  Parents and students would be fully-informed before they entered 1st grade this test would be coming, so they could prepare (or not) accordingly.  The test would be a standardized test similar to what they already take now.  The top 50% scorers of that test would go on to publicly-funded high school (in a separate building), and the bottom 50% would go to part-day high school (covering just the essentials - English, math, etc) and spend the other half of each day working in apprenticeships for various professions (plumbing, carpentry, computer programming, etc) - whatever industry is predicting demand for would be choices.

This gets the bulk of the troublemakers or ones with little academic inclination/gifts out of the ""bound for college"" high school, so curriculum levels can be raised and classes are far-less disrupted.  The bottom half folks will graduate with essentially a GED and a skill they can earn good money at (now having 4 years experience at it).  These people can still attend college but they may be required to jump through some hoops of taking catchup classes to plug the gaps.

This has the benefits I described above of raising curriculum standards and classroom behavior, but it also introduces some competition into the K-12 lives of students.  One might think this is undesirable, but I'd argue it's desirable to expose kids to the types of competitive pressures they will see in every aspect of adult life, instead of being slapped in the face with it after being sheltered in school.  This would also put parents on notice if they intend for their kids to attend college.  This will make parents far more likely to prepare and motivate their kids to pay attention, behave and do the work/study.",pdoherty972,t2_qp4h5,1,0,reddit2

hyncfvu,t1_hyl77vq,2022-02-27 14:42:54,WorkReform,"This is right. What happened is that subs are usually used for this. During the staffing shortage, other teachers were asked to fill in. They are paid an hourly rate on top of their salary for this. When this doesn't cover all the classes, often anyone available will watch the kids. So, secretaries, administrators, really anyone who is available at the time. And, I believe, if it gets bad a large group of kids might have to go to the gym and be supervised by a staff member (so, not a normal class size, a bunch of kids and a staff member or two). 

Staffing shortages hit NM schools hard, probably like a lot of places. It's surreal. It's actually amazing that our schools are doing as well as they are right now. Things were sketchy for a minute but seem to be improving every day now. Staff have increased, and kids have settled down since August. 

Here, people often complain online about the national guard being called in to help. I didn't actually see any where I work. They must have been in other schools. I was grateful they were called in. What other solutions did we have? What's wrong with them subbing? 

An acknowledged part of the staffing shortage in NM schools is our HR. So, HR, at least in my district, did an ok job pre-COVID. Once COVID hit everything slowed down to a snail's pace. Or, really, since NM is known for let's say its relaxed pace, the ""land of mañana,"" it went from slow to ridiculous. Emails sent out would either not be answered or would be answered days or weeks later. All the teachers complained about it. This matters because HR approves substitutes, which shouldn't be the hardest job- confirming various credentials and making sure they've passed a background check. So, subs dwindled as we needed them, and schools didn't have staff. We didn't have enough security either, and if you've been to an urban public school you'll understand why this makes things weird. HR did a terrible job and it's a miracle our schools didn't devolve into complete and utter chaos. The bright side, I guess, is that staff DID pull together and make it work, and now things are getting better steadily. I mean, we had principals working as subs. Everyone pulled together and somehow we made it work.",largececelia,t2_16g7a45m,1,0,reddit2

Further, it allows loans to be made in the future with minimal risk. A lender may be more cautious, but they're not likely to close down shop because of it. If they're just out billions of dollars because people are allowed to not pay another cent, most will just shut down and declare bankruptcy.

kphdu2z,t3_1almn8x,2024-02-08 13:45:34,WorkReform,"So I work in HR (I know, I know). Anyway, dress codes are legal as long as they are applied equally. So if the boss is writing everyone up for equally stupid shit, sorry they can. 


The defense they're going to have is you and your coworker are customer facing, meaning what you wear could impact their business if customers form a negative opinion based on your appearance towards the business. 


This arguement has been even used and accepted legally to require differences based on gender in most district courts, i.e. for customer facing employees you can require a stricter dress code, that they adhere to gender based norms like make up for women, or no make up on men, etc. as long the cost difference isn't an undue burden on the employee (for example you have to wear Chanel foundation) and is clearly shared with the employees (why most of them are written in handbooks you signed you received or on orientation paperwork.)


It would only be sexual harassment if they apply the standard unevenly based on gender (for example everyone should wear polos but I only write up women who don't), if they offer to do quid pro quo (for example I'll remove the write up for a sexual favor), or if you/your coworker can show a reason for it to not be justified (for example, it's retaliation against you because you tried to do a protected active - reported some to HR or the boss's boss, or trying to form a Union, etc.)  That being said, the last one is hard because it has to meet the legal definitions. 


Your employer just needs to show they have applied the policy consistently.  So, unless you/your coworker have something else more complying from a legal sense, I'd advise looking for a new job. Sorry. ",Trollidin,t2_ccmkjiy,38,0,reddit4

1. It was detrimental to my health and I would get sick so much and it got worse and worse. One time I didn’t take time off while I had an asthma flair up I had to go to the hospital and was told BY a manager that I needed to get help. 

2. One time I had a 103 fever and they were still pressuring me to come in. 

3. During that time I had that fever, I got a supply staff after spending 2 hours BEFORE my 7:30 am shift messaging ppl on that supply list (3/4 of them didn’t respond and the other 1/4 didn’t even work there anymore). Got one person to respond and they agreed to take my 2 shifts. Said person leaves the first one early and NEVER showed up for the second one. My boss texts me asking where she went. (How tf am i supposed to know?) I told her I didn’t know and she agreed to take my shifts. Boss asked for proof of this and I sent her a screenshot of the person saying they agreed to take my shifts. Boss said “that’s not an actual agreement” (my ass) and that I need to come in or I’ll get a write up. I told her no. (How is it MY fault YOU can’t keep track of your staff and why is it MY fault another grown ass adult left their responsibilities they AGREED to). I messaged this person over and over again. No response. Turns out she went to school and never told me she had to go to school after the first shift when I explicitly stated I had 2 shifts I asked her to cover. I messaged her (still no response from her) that she needs to do better at communicating w/ me bc now I’m in hot water bc of her mistake. 


Needless to say I resigned the day after and didn’t return. If I’m willing to put myself in such a state of sickness I had to go to the hospital for you, and YOU write me up bc I have a fever and YOUR staff can’t communicate that’s your staff’s fault and your fault.

Has every employee been given a copy of the dress code/handbook, emailed a PDF, or is there one available for easy consultation in the store? 


Or has there been any previous communication about the bullshit VPL standards of this shop, like a memo, sign near the time clock, or verbally? 


If not, that strengthens any argument you may make to your employer about this being nonsense or a *possible* case. This all applies only if y'all are in the US. I have no clue about anywhere else. 


Of course, there are many things that go into a sexual harassment or hostile workplace suit and *I am not a lawyer*. 


I would recommend reaching out to the EEOC or at least consulting their website, especially if your friend is the only who has gotten such a writeup. 


There may be a local lawyer willing to do a pro-bono consult around this; if you know any lawyers even casually, reach out and see if they can recommend someone. Maybe there is a free legal clinic in your town/city, often held at libraries or a local law school campus.


 If your friend is a university student, they may be able to access free legal advice through their school, especially if there is a law school within the university or a large grad student population. 


I've worked in a lot of retail, hospitality, and service industry jobs and have been a supervisor, an assistant manager, and a manager. I cannot imagine having this as part of a dress code, not even in the high-end formal wear place or fine dining restaurants where I've worked. 


I've written, revised, and enforced dress codes/employee handbooks and this is beyond the damn pale.  


Start looking for new jobs if possible, you and your friend both, this owner sounds like the worst kind of small business owner. 


 Document everything daily via a little email to yourself/each other, word document update, or handwritten record. Even if it seems like a small weirdness, comment, or interaction, document it! Make sure you include the date and time of any incidents even if the document is time stamped automatically. 


Finally, once y'all are safely in a new job, see if you can put this shop on blast in any local media. Student newspapers are great for this if the shop caters to younger folks.

Well, besides ... Don't let this be the end. She needs to look for another job for sure but she has this shitshow written down by the owner and even signed! She should contact a lawyer for a quick counseling session regarding the laws where you live - and also when this BS expires legally. That way, if she doesn't like having confrontation and conflict in her work life she can wait with a lawsuit until she's found another job - or perhaps the lawyer will advice her to sue right away and get fired for it for a bigger payout. This employer needs to be put out of business so bad for everyones' sake!!!

Edited to add: She gets away with it probably not because of the mission statement but more the fact that no one has taken this to a lawyer/union yet. I live in a country where unions are common and there's a pretty established work routine regarding rules, salaries and stuff after almost 150 years of union presence. Here, employers are way less likely to take it personally when the union steps in or sues because they know where the line is already (or should know ...) and that it isn't personal. The way American businesses go about it makes it sound like it's ninjas attacking the work place, not a spokes person for the employees that'll ensure that they're honestly somewhat happy with the working conditions and motivated to actually stay and do a good job ...

Gendered dress codes are legal in CA, but have a much higher standard than the rest of the country. They can't put extra undue burden on any specific gender.

If the employee refuses to sign the form, you still have the supervisor and third party's confirmation that the employee was given a written warning and subsequently refused to sign it. 

It's just the employer covering their ass. There's two reasonable purposes for written warnings like this, firstly to let the employee know they're not upholding their end of the employment agreement and hopefully get them to correct their behavior and be a better asset to the company. If that doesn't happen, they become a documented and verifiable paper trail for when an employee gets fired for cause and tries to either claim unemployment or file a lawsuit for wrongful termination.

My post probably came off as complaining about people getting breaks. That’s not at all the case. A lot of the workers don’t want to take breaks, or only like taking small breaks just to eat, to make as much money as they can to make ends meet. 

No one has ever been denied a break. But people are being denied the chance to skip breaks when they don’t want them. I just wanted to see if the law actually required adults to take mandatory unpaid breaks. 

I was under the assumption that it was a workers right to not take a break, as long as they were 18 years of age or older. Seeing this sign made me question that assumption.

Most states have rules that allow for workers a set number of breaks depending on how long they've worked at a minimum. I remember them being 10 minutes every 2 hours, 30 minute lunch break for 6.5 hours. 10 minutes were mandatory paid breaks, 30 minute meal break was not paid, but everyone needed to be clocked out for at least 30 minutes. If you worked more than a 13 hour shift, you had to have 2 separate 30 minute breaks.

Employees not getting these breaks would have the store fined. Every store would have corporate run reports on clock in / clock out times to show any issues, and the GM of the store would receive a fine if there were consistent problems (more than 3 a month or something).

Ah, I was also living in indiana at the time, so that's why the 6 hour thing seemed familiar. Because the 6 hours does not include your 30 minute break, you have to work 6.5 hours for the break to be necessary. So if you work 6 hours and have not taken a break, you must clock out, and then clock in 30 minutes later for a few minutes then clock out for the automated systems to not ding the GM.

jtnzpuh,t3_15alje5,2023-07-27 14:15:25,WorkReform,"Worked in a store with similar issues, the problem that I found in those cases was that abandoning our duties for 30 minutes to take our break would fuck us for the rest of the day and we would spend the whole day behind because our managers were supposed to cover our breaks and either they flat out refused to or believed it was above them and left immediately after the break started. So you come back from your break with burnt chicken on the grill, needing 10 things and everyone else yelling at you for not having shit when you were supposed to be covered. So you then have to work 3 times as hard as normal to get back to standard and still likely have to stay late to wash your dishes since you would get no spare time to catch up. Which you get yelled at again for blowing labor, but they won't let you leave until your shift change is done. At the end of the day working through the 30 minutes was actually easier than taking it since not being on position for 30 minutes meant you would be playing damage control for the next 3 hours and was infinitely harder and they would threaten to fire you

Understandably a lot of people here are upset that people would complain about getting a break, but many times in restaurant work this can be an issue because of bad management vs competent employees and if you had the option of getting paid for not fucking your entire day then you'd probably take it too. This was in michigan so there's no laws requiring breaks except for minors so managers would only give the minors breaks and we were told ""if you want a break get far enough ahead that nobody will need you for 30 minutes"" which is moronic because they tell us exactly the opposite due to hold times on our food.",Xarit,t2_2zbu1qwp,1,0,reddit1

The store is right, they ARE losing money by employees refusing to go on break, a break that the store legally has to at the very least offer, and in some states enforce, to avoid legal action. You do NOT want to mess with labor laws, and most employers really just want their employees to be taken care of. Lots of people keep their stress to themselves, so by making them go on break you are helping to cool them down, even if they didn't want to go initially.

I work at a restaurant, and I'd say 65-70% of my coworkers would skip out on breaks if they could and for a variety of reasons. Some hate not getting paid for while they're at work (even when they're not working and on break), some hate breaking their workflow and it's annoying trying to get that workflow back, and some just get groggy after the break, so they'll have to perk themselves back up once they get back on their shift. Hell if I could skip going on breaks, I probably would a huge bulk of the time.

BUT it is important to ensure all employees at least have that option to take a break. Even if it sucks having to go on one, it's better having to go on a break and still get them versus never having that option available to you.",Crestego,t2_cwvo6r,1,0,reddit1

jtpdpyb,t3_15alje5,2023-07-27 19:27:15,WorkReform,"Yes, but it also depends on your state and/or your profession. 

In NY, for instance, worker breaks are mandatory for everyone, at least 30 minutes. In PA, your employer must offer you the option to take a 30-minute break, but you can decline. Your workplace must pay you for all hours worked, so they cannot order you to clock out for a break and have you work, even if it is just waiting for a customer to come in and buy something on a slow day. 

Certain professions, such as healthcare or trucking and transportation, have mandatory breaks and hourly limits, with a minimum of hours required for rest. This is federally mandated, but private companies may require more if they want to. 

Which leads me to my next point, that it's not illegal for private companies to require breaks, regardless of state or federal law, in industries that are not held to them. So yes, your job can take disciplinary action, up to and including firing employees who do not follow rules for breaks, which the company requires independent of state or federal law.",olde_meller23,t2_1ytkp06p,1,0,reddit1

keb10wv,t3_15alje5,2023-12-21 10:15:25,WorkReform,"I'm from Ontario, so IDK how provincial labor laws are different from State labor laws in the USA or elsewhere in the world. To my knowledge:

All employers must allot to their employees a minimum of 30 minutes worth of break time for every five hours worked within a given 24 hour span of time (unpaid OC). This is the blurb given by most relevant resources when you Google this topic. That said, I have yet to find any legal information regarding whether or not employers can reprimand employees with legal or material consequences for not taking breaks when requested.
Alternatively, from speaking directly with my mom, she tells me that the minimum required break time to be allotted to employees who work full time (8 hours or more in a given 24 hour span) is 50 minutes and that, unlike with part-time where is has to be negotiated with the employer, the 50 minutes have to split into two separate break times. I was unable to find any online resources to verify this claim however.

Considering the fact that provincial labor laws also technically protect the employees' right to refuse work under given circumstances, I'm willing to bet that similar logic could be applied if an employer tried to compel employees to take breaks on command.

Speaking from personal experience, I've been working at a McDonald's for about a year and a half now and on over a dozen occasions have intentionally forgone one of the two breaks I was allotted by my employer for my shifts, sometimes both, albeit begrudgingly. The main reason why I do it is simply because I'm a softy and I got tired of my managers chewing me out when I didn't get certain tasks done during my shift even when I barely had any time to accomplish them (I work overnight maintenance, which functionally operates much differently compared to the rest of the restaurant crew as you have to tackle your responsibilities according to your own methodology as opposed to following a set procedure). As of now, the work load I'm expected to do each night has gotten so massive that I quite literally have to clock in an hour early just to stand a chance of getting certain time sensitive tasks done on time. Legally, yes, I could just say fuck them and only do what I'm able to, but aside from my aforementioned apathy, there are a few other reasons why I take on such a large burden, the main being that the other maintenance workers are frequent flakes due to them having severe health complications that prevent them from being as consistent compared to me.

As I'm writing this, I literally got sent home early by my shift manager after I butted heads with them over not taking my break, on a night where I already clocked in early and the other maintenance worker called in sick after testing positive for COVID-19, forcing us to call in back up last minute, who arrived 2 hours late to the shift. I've already contacted the GM of the store, but it was mostly to levi my complaints about this whole situation, because, IMO, this is an example of a simple problem being addressed with a convoluted solution. Instead of taking time to assess the situation and offer some help or allocate labor to offset what I had to do, I was being threatened with reprimand for literally forgoing my legal rights due to time crunch. What the actual fuck?

To be fair, I understand why employers/managers do these sorts of things. They say that, legally, we have to take our breaks, but 5 minutes of Google searching evidently demonstrates that this is not the case. They say this to save face and hide the actual, material motivation for why they enforce this, which is to save money. The more time you spend on the clock as a wage based worker, the more money the company is expected to give you. I wholeheartedly believe that the McDonald's I work at would save a shit ton more money if they just fired me and replaced me with someone else who only worked the 8 hour shift and took the 50 minutes of unpaid break time, and I don't blame them if that's what they've been wishing for, that's business 101. Problem is, they know as well as I do that they can't do that because everyone else on the maintenance team sucks balls by comparison to my degree of efficiency and thoroughness (not speaking out of my ass here either, my GM quite literally said this to my face one time during a meeting we had in his office, albeit I'm heavily paraphrasing). If I, the person with the best work ethic of the entire crew by their own admission, can't get the work done in 8 hours, there's a problem with the work itself, not the worker.

For what it's worth, I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt and say, ignoring the fact that they have an obligation under their institutional position to discipline people, most managers do genuinely care about their employees well-being, but it's glaringly obvious that this whole situation reeks of tone-deafness. Honest, hard working people don't like leaving stones unturned. They don't like being exploited either, and they're smart enough to know when they are being exploited, but they also don't want to see their fellow workers suffer.

Your GM is an Asshole, Anon. Obviously, do try to take your breaks wherever possible, but also, don't let this crap slide. You need to tell that jerk straight to their face ""you want me to take my break? Make it so that it's actually possible for me to do so and get my work done on time and then we'll talk.""",Best_Fee5531,t2_adxh673f,1,0,reddit1

 Most of the time we only had two people working so one had to be there at all times to handle customers. We had pretty precise times when we would be able to take breaks without fucking up nightly tasks that were precisely timed out. So if taking a break resulted in coming back to a huge line of customers then we'd be late starting our nightly tasks which resulted in us having to stay late. Sure this is time I'm obligated to get paid for, but we really just want to go home. On top of that we'd get bitched and moaned at by the management for staying late saying we shouldn't need to stay late if we just worked faster. Ultimately if it was swamped with customers at the time we needed to start taking breaks then we'd decide to skip so we could leave on time.

All it does is extend the day by 30 min …while getting no additional pay.  Thats 30 less minutes we get to spend with our families.  It definitely makes sense for some jobs … but certainly not all of them. 
  
Same with working consecutive days in a row.  I understand a law saying you can’t be FORCED to work more than 7 days in a row.  But we have a few crews that really enjoyed their 7 on, 7 off schedule.  Now they’re forced to work 6, take 24 hours off then come back in for another day.    
   
That’s not too bad when they’re on day shift but it sucks ass for when they’re on night shift (working 5:45p to 6:15a).  It’s not like they’re going to swap back to a regular sleep schedule for that one day off.  Many of them look at it as the state turning their 7 on, 7 off schedule into 9 on, 5 off when on nights. 
  
All these laws have a good intentions but can really screw the workers over when applied the wrong way. They should definitely be optional for each individual.  If it make sense for you… great.  But taking time away from families when you already work long hours (simply to the check a box created by someone who knows nothing about your job/industry) is absurd.

Employers can't refuse to pay you for short breaks (like a bathroom break), and that meal breaks can only be unpaid if there is absolutely no working during the meal break.

Likewise, employees not receiving legally mandated breaks regardless of if they are paid or unpaid, would be a violation on behalf of the company, not the employee.

Rest Breaks
Employees must be allowed **a paid rest period,** free from duties, of at least 10 minutes for every 4 hours worked. Additionally:
Employees cannot be required to work more than 3 hours without a rest break.

Restroom breaks
Employees must be provided “reasonable access” to bathrooms and toilet facilities. *Employers **cannot restrict use** of bathroom or toilet facilities to rigid time schedules* (e.g., **only during scheduled breaks**), or impose unreasonable time use restrictions.

Where is the error here?

31 states do not have break requirements for adults. There are 50 states in the US. ""Most"" is a subset of items in a larger set that consists of more than half of the items in a larger set. 31 is more than half of 50.

Please ELI5 where I made an error there because I literally don't see it.

Of the 19 that do have break requirements, many only require meal breaks for long shifts and still don't require shorter rest breaks every 2-3 hours. I get that Washington does, and that's great, but that isn't how it is for the majority of the country.

There is *a lot* of confidently incorrect people in this thread spreading misinformation about the OP's break requirements being legally mandated.

>From their point of view, what they called “wage slavery,” renting yourself to an owner, was not very different from the chattel slavery that they were fighting a civil war about. You have to recall that in the mid-nineteenth century, that was a common view in the United States — for example, the position of the Republican Party, Abraham Lincoln’s position. **It’s not an odd view, that there isn’t much difference between selling yourself and renting yourself**. **So the idea of renting yourself, meaning working for wages, was degrading.** It was an attack on your personal integrity. They despised the industrial system that was developing, that was destroying their culture, destroying their independence, their individuality, constraining them to be subordinate to masters.  
>  
>There was a tradition of what was called Republicanism in the United States. We’re free people, you know, the first free people in the world. This was destroying and undermining that freedom. This was the core of the labor movement all over, and included in it was the assumption, just taken for granted, that **“those who work in the mills should own them.”** In fact, one of the their main slogans, I’ll just quote it, was they condemned what they called the “new spirit of the age: gain wealth, forgetting all but self.” That new spirit, that you should only be interested in gaining wealth and forgetting about your relations to other people, they regarded it as a violation of fundamental human nature, and a degrading idea.

This is wrong in so many levels.

Supply and demand determines all prices, including the wages of workers and the profits of owners. There’s very few people willing and able to take on the immense risks and responsibilities of owning their own business, and the role of the investor and entrepreneur is the most important role of any enterprise, so the combination of low supply and high demand for entrepreneurs and investors leads to large profits for those skilled enough to generate them.

Business transactions must be voluntary for all these capitalist principles to apply. Therefore, it is invalid reasoning to try to apply them anyway when their prerequisites are not met.

We are obligated to work together because it isn't possible for us to survive otherwise. Therefore, we all have a reasonable interest and expectation of participation in how the work is done.

>what the employer makes from it doesn't matter. 

It matters to us. Are you suggesting we should be prohibited from knowing or thinking about how much the boss makes off of our labor? How do you think you're going to do that?

You can try scolding, but we're not impressed.

>Being hired to do a job doesn't entitle you any control over the employer.

Being hired means you have the *ability* to exert control over the employer--employers don't have anything if you don't work, and most of them are kind of helpless on their own and so they couldn't do the work themselves even if they tried.

And *exercising* that ability can greatly increase the standard of life for the employees, and long term of the employer as well (it's better to be neighbors with a properous fellow citizen in a modern country than a King ruling over a medieval village of starving peasants).

So why shouldn't we do it? Your ability to stop us relies solely on you convincing us not to do what we are perfectly capable of doing and will make the world better.

Also; teach your wife to not stand for bosses talking to her like that, especially in public. Once she saw that he was gearing up to fire her she should’ve just left. No job pays enough for anyone to be belittled, or for bosses to question why you had children. 

I taught my wife to walk out when owners/managers go that far. She also works in the restaurant industry, the last time was an owners birthday party at the restaurant that was being incredibly mismanaged. It was a fine dining spot doing a buffet for the first time and it was gearing up to be chaos. 

She asked him a question and he said “I don’t give a fuck figure it out” I told her to walk out and that they don’t deserve her as an employee. These fine dining restaurant owners that act shitty don’t get to treat anyone how they want.

Your stance is that it isn't your responsibility to take on additional duties because I ""it's not my fault you chose to have kids"" and that if it had been a true emergency, I would have taken my child to the ER.

I remember people getting mad because a couple got married and wanted to go on their honeymoon, but they didn't think of the restaurant, and how it would inconvenience everyone if they took vacation.

When my wife was pregnant, my boss constantly bugged me for when her due date was.  I was at the four seasons, so I could take paternity leave for 2 weeks.  I told him when it was, and he asks if I should stay my paternity leave this day, or the next day.

I'm like, ""you know how this works right?""

""What do you mean?""

""She's going to go into labor, and then I'll let you know, and then paternity leave should start that day.""

""Look, I need to write a schedule.""

""So, here's her due date, but she could have it anytime, so I'll let you know as soon as anything happens.""

""Thanks, i appreciate it.""

We later scheduled a c section, and I let him know, and his response was, ""oh thank god.  Thanks, this really helps me out.""

I had to call out during my kids first year twice.  I had to bring them to the emergency room.  I have twins, so it takes 2 parents.

Dude literally wrote me up because I called out too often.

What Type of Leave Is Covered by the FMLA?
Under the FMLA, covered employers must provide eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave each year for any of the following reasons:

The birth of a child and to care for a newborn child within one year of birth;
The placement of a child for adoption or foster care with the employee, and to
care for the newly placed child within one year of placement;

**To care for the employee’s spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition;**

A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the
essential functions of his or her job; or
Any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son,
daughter, or parent is a covered military member on “covered active duty,” or
26 workweeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for a covered
servicemember with a serious injury or illness if the eligible employee is the
service member’s spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin (military
caregiver leave).

It’s unpaid time, but your wife has a right to return to that work. “Under the law, the employee has the right to return to the same or similar position with equivalent pay, benefits, and responsibilities.”",Xanthu,t2_5qrr2,3,0,reddit3

iyq278x,t1_iynugru,2022-12-03 06:59:03,WorkReform,"When I worked at Jimmy Johns one of my fellow managers got fired for a bullshit reason and when she applied for UE it got denied because the owner said it was “for cause”. She filed an appeal and had an in person appearance in front of the judge and the owner came down as well to fight the appeal, but was unaware that my former co-worker brought a current employee who was a witness to the wrongful termination. The judge ruled in favor of my former co-worker and chewed out the owner for his shitty actions. Especially since the person who got fired had no prior incidents, no write-ups, formal warnings or anything of that nature. After the appeal he went up to the former manager and asked “why would you do this? Why would you take it this far?” 

The event ended up changing store policy and it became much harder to be fired because the owner was worried that he would be dragged in front of a judge again. In order to be fired from that point on you had to have 3 write ups for the same issue over the course of a year and the writes up would be dropped after a year had passed. 

I also worked at a movie theatre, where the GM was on super thin fucking ice when I was hired because he fired someone for something he shouldn’t have and he ended up costing the company $10,000 in a settlement to the former employee on top of the court costs and what not.

CAUSE would imply some fuckery on your wife's to give reason to have the boss fire her, whether real or not.  The burden on the employer is to PROVE said cause.

My employer in the past tried to claim I was rude to a customer and that I did not try to keep a sale and allowed a return.  I was polite in my response and stated the company had a no hassle return policy.  My polite demeanor I saw was noted on file and the no hassle return policy was easily proven.  Won the appeal easily.

Your wife has text messages that can prove the boss was pissed because her child was sick.  That heavily derails any potential claim the employer has without some significant proof.

""Legally, offensive behaviors must affect the victim’s ability to work effectively and they must target a protected group. In individual cases, courts must decide which behaviors create a toxic work environment. 

Sexually explicit images or remarks, racist slurs, or religious-based harassment can all create a hostile workplace.

However, even severe hostility that does not target a protected group does not meet the qualifications for a hostile work environment lawsuit.""

This is a necessary and needed change, but to plainly state 'overdraft fees are theft' is not only stupid, it's wrong. You're essentially taking on a short term potentially high interest unapproved 'loan' if you don't have an approved overdraft for your mistake of not budgeting enough to stay out of an overdraft.

US overdrafts should just work similar to the UK. If you don't have an approved overdraft, then you just aren't able to overdraft or have a very limited overdraft, fees are capped at £25 a month and are typically a high 35% apr on your outstanding balance up to the monthly cap.",Vibrascity,t2_3n355kmv,1,0,reddit4

kic3aqa,t3_1990f06,2024-01-17 20:51:51,WorkReform,"Sorry guys, but overdraft fees are not theft. When you overdraw your bank account, you are taking money out of the bank's cash reserve. You are literally taking money that doesn't belong to you. The bank allows the charge to go through so you can make important payments, like groceries and rent. It's not unreasonable to charge a fee for the service. The fee also discourages people from getting carried away with negative balances.

Also, the reuters article states this:

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/biden-admin-unveils-proposed-curbs-overdraft-fees-2024-01-17/

>The new proposal would apply to banks with more than $10 billion in assets, allowing them to assess fees of between $3 and $14 to recover losses from overdrafts -- or more if they can provide cost data to show why this is justified.
The rule would also allow them to offer overdraft loans if they make clear disclosures, such as applicable interest rates, subject to the same regulations governing other forms of consumer credit.

So the fee cap doesn't apply to every bank, it's not hard capped at $14, and it creates a new avenue for people to get hit debt that accumulates with interest. That's fucking terrible regulation.",PomboRich,t2_uly85kfp,1,0,reddit4

When my wife and I combined our accounts, it was because her bank switched to a policy of charging you a monthly fee for the privilege of letting them use your money to invest in shit. She emptied her account the day we found out and shut it down. However, the account didn't ""officially close"" until the day after—when the policy took effect—and everyone was charged. So, because she had no money in the account for *their* charge, they sent her into overdraft, which meant we had to pay a fee for that and the fee they charged before they'd close her account.

If you make payments through ACH as in with your routing and account number instead of a debit card there is no way to avoid them, unless you opt into the banks overdraft protection (now you see why they call it protection).  When a transaction is sent through the ACH system but your account does not have the funds to clear it, the bank itself gets a fee from the automated clearing house.

They of course pass that fee onto you but that's why you got $35 fees.  Because you didn't authorize overdrafting and just had to take the insufficient funds fees instead.  It's literally a protection racket on the banks part.",A_literal_pidgeon,t2_deqx9wx0t,0,0,reddit4

Theft from whom?

If I write a check and there are not funds in my account when the check arrives at the bank, shouldn’t the bank just not pay it? Let the check holder come looking to me for the money I still owe them because the check wasn’t cleared?

Instead, what commonly happens is the bank pays the check anyway (as a “service” to me as the account holder) and plans to recoup that money when I next make a deposit. That’s a nice service to help me with cash flow management.

All that is cool like Fonzie, until banks began charging higher and higher fees for this “service” and it eventually became a clearly predatory practice designed to target low-income and financially uninformed customers. Whereby it became a “trap” more than a “service.”

Now, those excessive fee amounts will be capped at a lower amount to ensure that this returns to a service and not something banks use to increase revenues. Or, they could just stop offering the service…",NoCoolScreenName,t2_22yrxmau,7,0,reddit4

kidab70,t1_kicoii7,2024-01-18 01:06:59,WorkReform,"When I first moved to the US, I had about $12k of USD savings after using Wise to convert from CAD, and my only option at the time (before I was eligible to open accounts with online banks) was to move them from a Citi account I had as a holdover from my freelancing days. I thought I would leave it there before I could open a proper savings/money market account (Fidelity) and then move it over.

Once I was ready to move it over, I got the shock of my life when Citi closed my accounts and told me I'd be getting a check in the mail in 60 days. In reality, Citi held $12k of mine hostage for at least 6 months. Because of BSA/AML, they were legally not allowed to tell me why. And just repeatedly told me ""you should get your money in 60 business days"". It got so bad that I basically documented every last call I had with customer service for 6 months before just filing complaints with the FDIC and OCC.

Less than a week after filing said FDIC/OCC complaints, I get my $12k check in the mail overnighted to me.

Big banks are crocks of shit. I learned the hard way and now my main checking/savings accounts all with entirely online banks (Discover/Fidelity), with a backup account with my local CU for the rare occasion I need to deposit physical cash.

For anyone else reading: Unless you're a foreign student or just moved (i.e. you literally can't open a typical online account), I would strongly suggest going with an online bank and a local CU. Most online banks have very robust ATM networks (Allpoint, for example), while credit unions also operate on a similar very robust network and give you the flexibility to deposit physical cash. And online banks won't fuck you in the ass with antiquated UI, terribly designed fraud systems, and monthly and overdraft fees are generally non-existent with them (they'll just decline anything you can't afford debit-wise).",PSChris33,t2_durvq,3,0,reddit4

kiayy2b,t1_kiaxhdi,2024-01-17 17:12:57,WorkReform,">How do you define “overdrafting” as “theft?”

It's really not, since the bank agreed to have this system I'm place. I guess I should've phrased it better, like overdrafting is more theft to the bank than overdraft fees to the user in response to the title. - Unless with the caveat that you maliciously intend to overdraft without paying back. But I do recognize most overdrafts are unintentional. 

>Theft from whom?

Bank?

>If I write a check and there are not funds in my account when the check arrives at the bank, shouldn’t the bank just not pay it?

They have a program for that, overdraft protection where it draws from your savings, your credit limit or not even approve it. I think that should be the default, but I was asked that recently when I opened my account. 

>Instead, what commonly happens is the bank pays the check anyway (as a “service” to me as the account holder) and plans to recoup that money when I next make a deposit. That’s a nice service to help me with cash flow management.

At some point, brothers, you all should have a better grasp on your finances than write checks above your limit. Banks are evil, greedy bastards, I agree. Let's not fall victim into swiping debit card on purchases that we don't have money for?

>All that is cool like Fonzie, until banks began charging higher and higher fees for this “service” and it eventually became a clearly predatory practice designed to target low-income and financially uninformed customers. Whereby it became a “trap” more than a “service.”

Yea I get it's expensive to be poor. It's just how the system is. The poorer you are the higher risk you become lending money to, the higher the interest rates are, because of you defaulting. Is it perfect? No. But I don't know how to design a better system, if you do let's take a crack at this. 

>Now, those excessive fee amounts will be capped at a lower amount to ensure that this returns to a service and not something banks use to increase revenues. Or, they could just stop offering the service…

While it's very obvious Biden is not someone who is making decisions, he's basically senile at this point.

Not to mention he wasn't even prompted to talk about that when he brough it up, he was just going on some senile tangent. 

Here's a 20 minute compilation of Biden being basically senile. The bit with him saying Jill has to write him notes is at 1:57, you should watch the whole thing though it's pretty funny.

Why not?  Is the better answer trying to regulate the ones that have a stranglehold on our politicians? The ones who made BILLIONS off of people who literally didn't have the money?

How about the government 90% of the overdraft fees collected by banks in one year and using that funding to start the program?  That way people can't bitch about it because the ones that will probably need it the most are the ones that paid for it. But banks can't raise the fee higher than they already have it.

I bet you see a dramatic increase in the amount of times a bank will forgive the overdraft fees.

Hell even make it 40% so they can't associate it with the old wealth tax(you know, the one that led us to an era of unimaginable prosperity for *everyone*?) or say it is an unfair burden on them.

WTF no one said anything about about Israel. And this whole paragraph reeks of Stockholm syndrome. Telling suffering people that they must vote for more suffering or else they get more suffering is not a motivator and never will be.

The truth is that a vote for an unacceptable candidate is an approval of their actions, and a signal to the party that you support those actions. Even if you write to your reps or polls don't approve of their actions, it doesn't matter - they know you will still show up and vote for them.

The DNC reminds me a lot of BlockBuster when I worked there as it was going bankrupt. Netflix came along and BB tried to imitate, and their program was pretty sweet, actually. You could get movies in the mail and drop them off at a BB and get a free rental, plus your new movies mailed out as soon as they were scanned, so it was faster than Netflix. Then the obvious flaws started showing with less inventory on hand and more breakage, etc, etc, and they kept changing terms and prices, All things that employees who worked in the stores knew were horrible ideas. But the bosses kept saying ""this is what you have to do"", so they kept losing customers, and eventually closed. 

There's a real parallel there between the DNC and BB, especially if you were around when Bernie was first running.

Dogs are a part of people's families, and need and deserve to be treated as well as a human child deserves. It's not always an easy job, dogs have dietary restrictions, medication, special needs, walking (which isn't easy if you're anything even slightly less than able-bodied), play time, being let outside (and monitored outside if they are troublesome or elderly or it's night), etc. ((Plus, the housesitting chores on top of it.)) I treat other people's pets like clockwork on a strict schedule, whereas I'm more relaxed when I'm with my own pets. If it's a job, it's a job. Just because you get to pet a dog ""at work"" doesn't diminish the fact that you're responsible for another person's family member.

Work reform is so people who work a full work week get compensated for their time and dedication to the job and get treated fairly and given benefits for working 40 hours a week. I don't care if you serve fries at McDonald's or own a large factory, but if you work full time you damn better be able to afford housing and a couple of kids and a spouse.

The moderator literally doesn't want to work. They were part of the original antiwork movement was labeled a ""lazy anarchist subreddit"" looking to abolish work altogether.

The eat shit and die attitude people have towards others for have ""lesser capability"" is beyond disgusting. While you can say ""nope"" I just dont think they deserve as much. When ""not as much"" is less than needed to eat/shelter themselves thats a huge problem. 

End of day 7-9% of people outright afraid of dogs great many wont do poop picking up. Others lack capability to walk long distances.Hold back bigger dogs etc. Stick to good habits that train dogs properly. 

I for example excel at trades manufacturing ""physical work"".

I would likely just lay down and wait for death than go back to call center. 

There are apitudes for everything alot of people misjudge certain jobs. Like had friends in trades that ended up flipping burgers during big obama era recession. Most couldn't handle it at all if you offered them twice the money they currently make in trades they wouldn't/couldn't do it again. 

But ultimately your argument is not only that people dont deserve to live ""because jobs not hard enough"" is beyond reprehensible. Even if you phrase it nicely. Secondly you often are arguing against your own self interest. 

By having ""base"" be below living it now takes ""skills"" the you deem ""worthy"" of calling skilled.

You said ""I respectfully disagree with that sentiment"" 

He didn't say I think dog walkers should be millionaires living life of luxury. So you directly disagreed with ""living wage"" and then proceeded to explain how people are more or less deserving. 

While I agree there are jobs harder dangerous less desirable. And compensation should reflect that. The debate when talking about ""the undeserving"" isn't about affording a Cancun vacation. Its about ability to see a doctor when you get sick rather than just coughing for 3-4 months till you either croak or end up in ER with much more serious problem as a result. 

And ultimately what bugs me about it. Is first the ""skill gap is considerably narrower than portrayed thought of"". Fact is there is alot of people that working ""high skilled"" jobs that retail/fast food/call centers would absolutely bring them to mental breakdown wouldnt last a day. As well as people use softer language excuses say well I make x don't think I should make the same as x. BUT they are barely scraping by or actually unable to live without huge concessions like skipping health insurance stacking roommates without firewood.  Thus when they argue that people should have ""less than them they are arguing against those people deserving to live"". Even if they don't directly say or are ""nice"" about it doesn't change they are arguing against peoples ability to have enough to survive. 

Which does get me a little heated so I do use the ""eat,shit, and die"" phrasing terminology in regards to peoples attitudes or use it to describe min wage. Because it reflects what people are saying just without the nicety and camouflage.",asillynert,t2_12cdum,5,0,reddit1

I agree the burden of proof is on me to prove my original points, which I will do now, but you also made claims that you have to back up, which you have yet to do.

In terms of pay, the average adjunct professor makes around $3,000 per course. If they teach 4 courses per semester, that would make 8 courses in a year. That would equal $24,000 per year.

I can't find solid numbers for how many hours a week they work. so we will have to use hypothetical numbers. Adjunct professors are not required to do research, so their work time involves the time they spend teaching classes, time spent grading work, and time spent preparing for class. If they teach 4 classes at 3 hours a week, that is 12 hours. Grading work we can say that takes around 3 hours a week (these numbers vary, could be less and could be more). Preparing for class we will say 5 hours (this is definitely high but I will still use it, and would likely only be for the first year or two).

So that is 20 hours a week. 20 hours a week X  37 weeks is 740 hours a year. I say 37 weeks because they don't teach over the summer and part of Dec/Jan. 24,000/740= 32. That is $32 an hour.",baltimorebruce,t2_hv9ox,0,0,reddit1

No. The data presented – along with the primary sources cited – does, in fact, back up my claim the majority of full-time faculty positions were tenure track. That you do not care to do the necessary reading to verify that for yourself is not my problem. I'm not going to download, clean, and merge a bunch of yearly .csv files in order to spoon-feed you proof.

>Adjunct professors are not required to do research,

While this may *technically* be true, any adjunct who wants to make the leap to a tenured position – which, if you're paying attention, is now north of 70% of all faculty jobs – *must* publish research papers. To pretend otherwise is intellectually dishonest.

>That is $32 an hour.

The fact you already halved your original $60/hr claim without me needing to lift a finger is a dead giveaway you're not arguing in good faith, by the way. The fact you halved your original estimate and are still wildly underestimating time spent in order to do so is... morbidly funny? Dumb as hell? Some combination of the two. Teaching a single course of four classes will take you to 40 hours per week even if you're not the coordinating faculty member, and that's on top of the research that adjunct faculty, again, must still produce because tenure positions have been steadily replaced by adjunct ones. As I showed you above.

Hahahahaha. Okay, I'll admit, the irony got me good. That's not what an ad hominem is, by the way. An ad hominem is ""your argument should be discounted because you're lazy"", not ""what you're saying reflects poorly on the person you're talking about"".
