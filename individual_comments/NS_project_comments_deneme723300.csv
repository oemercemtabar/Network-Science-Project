h3xanp5,t3_ocxwrc,2021-07-03 14:45:17,MensRights,"The irony is women don't do emotional labor either.   Unless bitching and bullying and manipulating counts as labor.  If you count unproductive, anti-social and criminal behaviors as labor I guess maybe they have a point.  At best it's labor aimed at getting someone else to do something for you that you can't be bothered to do for yourself.

It's like a slave overseer complaining to slaves that they just don't understand what hard work it is having to whip them.

 ---------------------

What would legitimate ""emotional labor"" look like?

* Which sex commits suicide four times more often?  If women are supposed to be doing real emotional labor that feels like a fail to me.  Talking people off the ledge is hard work and emotional alright, but it feels like women are slacking on the job if that is to be considered their job.

* Emotional labor could mean romance and the small acts of love that keep a relationship together.  But it's men not women who do that stuff.  Saint Valentine's Day isn't about women giving men gifts.  Everyone knows Mother's Day is taken seriously and Father's Day is a joke.  Ladies are not as good as men at emotional labor is one conclusion from that.

* Men are constantly seeking to understand and mollify women.  That's why we have sayings like ""what do women want?"" but women's take on men is lazy and dismissive ""men only want one thing"" (something women are then encouraged to withhold as emotional manipulation). We say ""happy wife, happy life"" but nobody cares about the man's emotional needs.  People who would laugh at how awful a present for a wife a vacuum cleaner is would be just fine with buying tools for a man.

* When men get called to deal with a beetle or a spider isn't that emotional labor?

Against this stuff feminists argue women do emotional labor because they remember birthdays (do they?) and keep in touch with family friends.  That sounds a lot like they're just doing whatever they would have done anyway.  It's like arguing that playing video games is ""communications labor"".  If the woman is the one working to keep track of the man's friends who aren't her friends then you'd have a point, and that does sometimes happen.",DavidByron2,t2_gatel,155,0,reddit2

Hypoagency. If you need help, it's your responsibility to ask for help.

There's a lot of thing in her post that she's choosing to do, then she got overwhelmed and is now angry that her husband didn't ride up to her on a white horse as soon as she crossed the border from 'Things I'm Taking On' to 'Things I Need Help With'.

Also,

>he doesn‚Äôt ask what he should do to help because I‚Äôm a control freak (fair comment, I can be)

The husband very clearly stated why he doesn't get involved.

It's pretty clear that HE is doing a lot of emotional labour as she takes on too much, wants it all done 'the right way' (i.e., her way), and then gets upset when it overwhelms her and uses him as an emotional punching bag because it's HIS fault for not providing exactly what was needed in HER unknown, unspoken plan of action. 

It must be tiring going through that cycle.

To be fair, they both need to communicate their needs to the other.

It sounds like he wants to help but he wants also agency. He gets to do his tasks the way he sees fit. This would allow him to be more proactive.

It sounds like she wants ~~everything she doesn't have but needs, at the right moment and in the right way~~ more of his active involvement but she'll have to relinquish control and let go of the idea of perfection.

Finally, some people are just passive and will let cede power to whomever takes it. She must have known this before marrying this man but was perhaps too focused on the benefits to consider the negatives. A control freak can't have both a partner with passive personality that will allow the control freak the full measure of their power *and* the misandrist idealized version of a husband, who is competent and confident in all things, completely attuned to her emotions at all times and who will always shield her from reality by doing everything that needs doing in order to protect her from being overwhelmed.

Oh, a self-admitted control freak has *also* henpecked her husband into being frozen, not knowing what to do. So she goes onto a feminist subreddit so people can enable her instead of working on her problem with her S/O. You can't make this shit up.

Her constant whining just makes her look like an exhausting person. In an 8-hour work day, I could completely plan an entire year worth of vacations, buy every type of insurance we need, do our taxes, do all of the holiday season shopping, meal prep for an entire week, clean our entire house from top to bottom, call special pickup for any old garbage we need to throw away, and even have time to clean out the rain gutters. The reason why I chose an 8-hour work day is because that's the average amount of time full-time working men spend working over full-time working women a week. 

Like, she's complaining about writing and recording a fucking *song* for someone, because obviously any reasonable person would put that right at the top of their priority list. Then she whines about men being shit.

This whole post is nothing but a control tactic, its not a vent, you lost control of a situation and that doesnt suit you so you are trying to find someone else to blame and as always the one person in your life who puts up with your shit takes the blame. You dont appreciate anything your man does for you, its never enough and it never will be, you dont deserve a relationship.
 I bet that man has you in his thoughts EVERY minute of every hour every day, everything he does is overshadowed by the thought of what will X think, will this make X happy, will she be upset if i do this. This whole attitude is controlling and you feel this way when you are losing that control. Go apologise to your man.

Manual labor is great, it is easy, non-thinking thing. (or at least very low brain power needed).

Then after which, she complains about him not just helping out instead of asking if and where she needs help. That is so stupid it's insane. Firstly: she says he's quite good at the chores around the house, and maintenance. This makes me assume, everytime theres been a maintenance problem or a physical labor job, it's been his ass out in the sun or standing on top of a rickety labor, meaning she sat on the couch scrolling reddit or just handing him tools. I'm sure the husband wouldn't appreciate if she climbed that same ladder with him on it to help out, without asking if and where he needed help. The important part about asking where someone needs help is it avoids further setbacks by avoiding misunderstandings. She's complaining about him not being able to detect what needs to be done, which is all in her mind. Also, mother's day doesnt entitle anyone to anything except saying ""happy mother's day"". Seriously, who else took part in the action of you becoming a mother aside from your immediate family, and who initially asked to make a child? More often than not, it's the mother herself. If it is, her choice makes me buy gifts for her? That's horseshit. I understand a grown up child getting a gift for his/her mother as a thanks. I dont understand anything else.

I mean I've never had a woman agree trade places with me.  Like not even factoring in a hypothetical job switch.  Just trading mowing and home maintenance and things like that for their share of the inside work (I already do quite a bit of the cooking and cleaning as it is).

As for gifts on holidays I do have a few observations there, but they mostly revolve around a lot of women thinking that kind of stuff is more important than it actually is, and taking control and bossing around the man they're with instead of letting him do things the way he wants to.

If I want to get something simple like a gift card to a nice restaurant and tell my mom in person how much I love her, and that's my style of doing things, why is that not valid?  Why do you automatically assume the consumerist, wasteful, frilly gift wrapped trinkets thing that she was doing is the correct way to do it?  And if he's leaving it to her it's only because she won't let him do it the way he wants to do it and he's leaned that mistake from previous years being with her.

Trust me I've been there done that with that exact type of woman and she, and every other woman like her, needs to take several steps back and give her man room to breath so that he can do things the way he wants to. Including for his own fucking mom on mother's day.  If she wants to do the wasteful, consumerist gift wrap bullshit with her own mom then she's more than welcome to. But it's his mom and if he wants to do something different he should be allowed to.  What you're looking at is an abusive, controlling relationship, and you are defending the abuser.  This type of shaming behavior is often what traps men like this into this type of bullshit.

In the most basic definition, no, of course I don't personally approve of men ruling over women as a socially accepted policy. But that was rarely and never truly the case in any society in history. In strictly hierarchical societies, yes, you had that dynamic at work but it was just as bad for lower class men. And really, it's not any different than what exists today where the wife of the highest standing man is second only to him.

But here we can see what's happened with the transition away from a patriarchical society: Women get the vote and immediately start voting perks for themselves with very little concern for society as a whole. Kooky ideas become the norm as ""experiements"" just to see what happens and society more or less starts breaking down with drug use and over-indulgence. Everything we've built more or less gets cashed in and used up because women as a group are terrible at planning for the future at a societal level. So, I kind of have to agree that patriarchy is good if the alternative is a bunch of flakey ideas using a lot of big words because they ""resonate"" with women without actually saying anything.",Past-Difficulty6785,t2_92u6vm9j,5,0,reddit2

Normally, I don't use the term 'equality' ‚Äì in regards to romantic relationships ‚Äì to refer to the balance of authority, but to the value of the persons. What people conflate quite easily in these conversations, is these two different kinds of equality.  


>Authority inherently implies there is a more powerful and a less powerful party in the dynamic, whether that be on the workfloor or in a personal relationship.

What you say here is true, and that's exactly what is so important as far as I'm concerned.

The reason there is a power dynamic in a company, is because the company is incapable of functioning properly without it. If there is no one consistently calling the shots on (important) decisions, you can forget earning a profit. It also has to be the case that the persons in these functions are suited for their positions. Different people have different skillsets; some people can be excellent project planners to carpenters, while they are horrible carpenters themselves.

None of this makes the people on the workfloor any less valuable than the manager, and it is similar in a romantic relationship.

The beautiful differences between men and women are designed by God to be complementary, not to be neglected. It's like switching the places of different cogs and gears in a perfectly designed machine.

h45rbi8,t1_h450dw4,2021-07-05 19:39:21,MensRights,"I think we agree more than we disagree. What you say is true; there are always going to be societal stereotypes of masculinity and femininity, which change over time. They will often line up with proper ideals of the two, but when that happens, it's a symptom and not a changing of the actual principles. We shouldn't line up to the expectations of society, but to that which is *good*.

One such stereotype that I horribly dislike, is the idea that an authoritative man deals with his wife harshly, and punishes her physically or mentally in a harsh way. As far as I'm concerned, a good husband deals with his wife patiently, in love, *much* *more* so with his wife ‚Äì who he has committed himself to for the rest of his life ‚Äì than with anyone else.

A man who is authoritative does not have to rule harshly, it's a big misunderstanding. While they coincide sometimes, they are *far* from the same thing. A proper leader *serves* the people he leads. He ought to do it for them and not himself. The same is true for a man and his wife; a man ought to lead his wife, but do so by serving her. If a man has an unhappy wife because of the way he treats her, he's doing just as bad a job as a manager with depressed employees.

As far as I'm concerned, assertively serving (who is yet to be) your woman ‚Äì that would be chivalry ‚Äì is right in line with the core of the design; it's an absolutely beautiful thing.

Societal ideas often flow from complementarian principles, but they *aren't* the principles themselves.

Things like women doing the cooking and men going out to work, are, more than anything, side-effects or symptoms of keeping to complementarian principles. So, a man staying home or a woman going out to work, doesn't necessarily make either less masculine or feminine.

Leading by serving is actually the best way to lead, but it's not one many people know is even possible, because they've (almost) never experienced it.

The most important thing in leading properly, is to talk to people individually. If I see that there is a better way to handle something in my relationship with my girlfriend, and my girlfriend disagrees, I sit down and talk to her. After all, if I have chosen the most sensible option, I can make a case through arguments that this is actually the best way to go about things.

So we sit down, I listen to her disagreements, and we talk through them. If she is wrong, she'll gladly admit it (not always in the moment, but she always does), so we can move on in unison. The reason we constantly talk about things, is because I can be wrong too. If she can explain to me by making a case that I'm wrong, then I'll have to admit it and we can move on in the same way.

That's leading by serving. A leader is just as human as the people/person he leads; he makes mistakes.

By leading this way, there is no room left for harshness, except for rare situations where it is necessary. I don't ""keep my girlfriend in line"", she stays ""in line"" because she loves me. She *wants* to take my advice, she *wants* to let me lead and she *wants* me to correct her when she's in an emotional mood. Not because I force these things upon her, but because she's experienced all that as very helpful and positive.

A good leader is one that people *want* to follow, because they know he can lead them well. As a Christian, Jesus is the perfect example of leading through serving. It is because he loved people that people came to listen to Him and to follow Him.",blanck24,t2_108mvy52,1,0,reddit2

Sometimes a sympathetic manager can and will respond to your appeal, but the Peter principal ensures a large number of supervisors are not going to be responsive, particularly if they are the same gender as the ones making the sexist remarks.

It sounds terribly depressing, but the best way I ever found to deal with sexism in the workplace during my many years on the job was to ignore the ones engaging in it as a group, and mention my displeasure only in a one-on-one setting if they made a sexist remark to my face.  Over time, everyone came to understand where my limits were in that subject.

When women passed male-bashing joke emails or cartoons to me, I trashed them.  I did not make a negative comment in public or in front of several of their group about it though, lest I become their target, because as you may know sometimes a gossipy group can push a good worker out the door for not having the "" good humor"" to play along.

Or agree with them sarcastically in order to make them see the sexism.

I've spent a lot of my life trying to challenge people on their beliefs and lay out for them the logic and reasons why I think they'd be better off with different behavior.  Success?  Almost zero.  But lately I've been experimenting with consciously deciding to talk positively about certain things and it's had a lot of impact on affecting people around me in what I consider is a positive way.  

For example I think a raw diet is very healthy.  I've seen science to prove this.  I've shown people science to prove this.  I've reasoned it out so many times.  And nobody was interested.  

So I switched strategies.  

Now whenever someone asks how I'm doing I answer with something like ""well to be honest I feel better than I've ever felt in my life"".  If they ask why I say ""It's been this way consistently since I started the raw diet.  I don't think I'm ever going back to cooked food.""  

I never make it about them and how they're wrong.  I make it about me and how right it is for me.  

It may take some creativity to be able to speak well of men without it being obvious that you're actively trying to engineer opinion.  But here are some examples.  I don't mean use these directly, but think of things like them to say:  

* ""Hey did you hear there are groups of guys who decided to stay in the buildings in NYC when everyone else left, so they could take care of the elderly people on the top floors.  They have to hike up like 50 flights of stairs to bring these people water and food.""  
* ""You know my husband has a pretty good sense of this sort of thing.  The other night he said ... ""  
* ""I really like that guy Maurice who delivers on Wednesdays.  Have you noticed he's never late?""  

In short, be an example, not a critic.  It may not seem like it's working at first, but it will be slowly building an image in their minds and it will improve their thinking.  

Also remember that it's not just a problem because it's sexist.  If your co-workers like to while away the hours by complaining about stuff it's also a psychologically unhealthy activity.  Focusing and talking about positive things makes people happier and more effective, so you won't just be exemplifying respect for men but also positive thinking in general.

In fact, female supporters often attempt to pawn off responsibility for their violation of their infant children's genitals by saying they want to make their sons ""look like daddy,"" even though they may never actually see daddy's penis; completely avoiding the Jocastan implications of mothers wanting their sons' genitals to resemble their husbands', it's primarily considered a mother's right to circumcise, a mother's choice.  Often, the ""choice"" [is described as](http://www.justmommies.com/articles/choosing-circumcise.shtml) somehow more traumatic and emotional for the *mother* than for the infant being cut up, and mothers often seem to think that [if it doesn't hurt that much, it must be okay](http://www.circleofmoms.com/young-moms-aged-20-30/circumcision-what-s-your-experience-619407#_).

Just like the wedding is essentially a debutant ball for the bride in which the groom is simply lucky to participate, the birth and nurturance of the child is seen not as for the good of the child, but for the good of the mother.

Yes, they do happen sometimes, and that's why duglock suggested the direct orders to cease the activities. Thus they are being fired for not following directions as opposed to the act of harassment. All in all, it's very thoughtful on all sides of the coin. I mean, they could definitely just fire the individual for the sexual harassment and have **that** on the person's record but instead choose to side with a non-permanently-defacing-employee option.

Those conversations threw me smack up against realization of my own over- extended priviledge as a westerner and as a mom.  

Now, I actually feel like circumcision for non-Jews serves no purpose whatsoever than to conform to a religious standard that never applied to my family in the first place, we not being of the Jewish faith.  

Perhaps the presence of a majority of men having been circumcised lessens stigma for practicing Jews, but at the risk of sounding anti Semitic, why should an entire society conform to any minority's religious practice?  Many of these men are from protestant or agnostic perhaps even Catholic families.  How did this practice even come to be the societal norm in the first place?

To be honest, I hold the medical establishment partially accountable.  After giving birth, women who otherwise have not even considered circumcision as an option are quizzed by doctors "" do you want us to schedule a circumcision for your son?"". The idea is then planted, and the decision is often made after only a short conversation about historically inaccurate reasons why others have traditionally done it in the past.  This exerts a very subtle pressure for the parents to conform.  They are new at this parenting business, who are they not to take the advice of the older and wiser medical staff?  The decision is even easier if the parents already circumcised an older brother.  

Now I think  if men wantto appear Jewish (or whatever other religions may require circumcision, i am not an expert on religions) it ought to be an adult decision, like getting a body piercing or tattoo.

At the time I realized like everyone that the driver discriminated against him for his skin color. It didn't occur to me the driver discriminated against him for his sex too.

Here's the start of the New York Times article:

**Danny Glover Says Cabbies Discriminated Against Him**

By MONTE WILLIAMS
Published: November 4, 1999

The actor Danny Glover, of the ''Lethal Weapon'' series, ''Beloved,'' and other films, filed a complaint yesterday with the City Taxi and Limousine Commission, charging a cabdriver with discrimination on Oct. 9 for refusing to allow him to ride in the front passenger seat.

Mr. Glover, who is black, said he was already angry because several hours earlier five yellow cabs had failed to stop for him, his daughter and her roommate at 116th Street and Seventh Avenue.

At a news conference yesterday in the lobby of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, Mr. Glover, with his daughter, Mandisa, a senior at New York University, at his side, said he had been visiting her from San Francisco. When those cabs passed them by, Mr. Glover said: ''I was so angry. The fact that my daughter's here to go to school, it really upsets me that if she's standing on the corner waiting to get a cab, she can't get a cab. It happens to her, it happens to countless people every single day. The fact that I'm a celebrity, the fact that I'm visible, allows me to draw attention to this.''

tells you more about the fact women simply don't want the jobs, as opposed to any myth there's a ""patriarchy"".

Yet another example of the fact the ""Wage Gap"" is nothing but a myth in all but the minds of the delusionally persecuted and ignorant.

The fact is men work the dirty and dangerous jobs, as well as the more prolific and well-paid jobs. Women who say they want equality have no idea that men work more hours, including overtime, and that's why men earn more.

While i support the idea of women venturing into the realms where men historically dominate the fields, i can't help but think this is somehow going to be spun as the women failed because the men.

there will be some nonsense about ""barrier to entry"" and ""hostile environment"" to work etc, because it would else require the women admit they simply can't hack it doing some men's jobs.

the fact is women don't want these boring, dangerous, underpaid jobs. yet most women are totally fine letting their fellow men take-up the slack by doing dirty and dangerous jobs, while simultaneously complaining men aren't helping women achieve ""equality"" enough.

Then when women try to address the balance, they fail to support themselves to make the balance happen, proving their lip-service to such ""equality"" really is secondary to having the convenience of letting the men do all the work.

for all the hate against men for supposedly treating women like ""princesses"", the women certainly like to play the part well enough, right down to the entitlement and spoiled attitude of letting ""lesser"" men do the dirty work for them.Ôªø",p3ngwin,t2_3aa2m,6,0,reddit4

The females we did hire soon began asking for weekday/daytime only shifts, shorter shifts, more days off than other drivers and fully expected to be treated like drivers with years of seniority and to have extra calls thrown their way on slow nights - at the expense of other drivers. Most of these 'needs' were expressed before the first week was finished. I can't imagine pushing that hard anywhere as a new-hire.

It almost became a policy to avoid hiring them due to the extra hassles involved.

cn8gidj,t1_cn7ddka,2014-12-29 17:55:29,MensRights,"Ofcourse the demand is there. Doesn't mean it's right. The vast majority of women wouldn't want to date/fuck a taxi driver, so as far as they would be concern that guy is worth less than dirt. Better have a woman because, as the stereotype goes, she's safe and fun too! She's just another ""girlfriend"" with whom she can gossip with. It's not like they haven't been living the last few decades being told that women are all safe and friendly kindred-spirits, and men are misogynistic assholes and potential rapists for even having a sexuality.

And men? Why wouldn't they want a woman driver? They would be fine with fucking/dating a female taxi driver, if the opportunity was there. So, what's the benefit of having a male driver when all other relevant factors would be equal?  It's not like they haven't been living the last few decades being told that a woman can do everything a man can, and that they would be misogynistic assholes if they ever thought differently.

The problem isn't that the demand exists. The problem is the amount of sexism, ignorance and prejudice towards men to support that demand. If you went back a few decades in the US. There would most certainly have been a demand for ""whites-only"" taxi cabs, even if it was all rooted in prejudice, racism, ignorance.  Given that it is entirely socially acceptable to discriminate against men, the bigger money is with the majority that stands by that discrimination. The fact that there's money to be made by catering to bigots doesn't make it ethical to do so.  ",ExpendableOne,t2_4o06h,1,0,reddit4

cn8fobl,t1_cn7loxt,2014-12-29 17:30:02,MensRights,"It's not that men and women are ""meant"" to follow strict gender roles. That's like saying that, because there are more Indian drivers, this is ""their roles in society"". Which is both wrong and pretty offensive. Men and women can do the same things, the problem is that we live in a world where women still behave and are treated like princesses. They still want special treatment and have very sexist ideals, but still want men to provide it for them. 

 Most women don't want to work those hours because that would mean losing out on all the other social opportunities that would be abundant to them because they are women. Most women don't want to work those extra hours because the money is not as necessity for them the way it would be for men(having money is not a crucial/mandatory aspect of their social/sexual value). Most women would prefer to be driven and have fun/no-care than have to drive and be responsible/accountable. Given the same opportunities and preferential treatment, men would want the same things too.

 This is not even anything new. There's a reason why, in virtually every family, the father/man tends to be the one who does most of the driving. Not only does society reinforce those roles but women favour/value men by those gender roles.  This is a very similar problem to the one you have in STEM fields, where you have a lot of opportunities for women to succeed in those fields but find that most women don't want to work those fields because they have so many other alternative opportunities and privileges available to them.",ExpendableOne,t2_4o06h,1,0,reddit4

An equally credible theory/reason (which is also speculation) is that women don't feel confident and safe enough in New York (where this service is being launched at) to become drivers. A.k.a. they aren't willing to take the risk/burden. If we find out that SheTaxi is willing to pay anywhere between $10 to $25 per hour (lower and upper average payrates for different driving services), then it's less about ""bad business"" and more about females having different priorities & levels of risk than males.

Edit: my speculation is further strengthened when you look at the taxi industry as a whole -- ""Currently only 3% of New York's 115,000 taxi drivers are female"".

I mean, heck, lets contrast and compare. 

If I step into a car with a driver, I know, the chances are roughly 30 %. 

30 % I am going to get a tweaker. You know, someone with obvious heroin scars, that tries to tell me about the one time he saw buddah in church, and he told him his highschool was ran over by welsh people. That is why he had to eat all those magic mushrooms, you know, divine need...The one that you can tell has just been off the needle for 2 weeks, and that tries to get his shit back together , and the only place willing to hire is the taxi. 

30 % I am going to get habib. Yes, I am using the stereotypical asia Minor / middle eastern name, because it's a stereotypical situation and allways the stereotypical guy. Nice guy, funny accent, name with more vowels then I have ever seen in a plate, but ALLWAYS with a smile. They will tell you, with an unflinching smile, how their wive hates them, their kids no longer want to be recognised as his race, his friends back home  in the old country think he is a sellout, and his little dog got run over by a drunk driver, but like a dolphin, he is smiling. Yea, he may smell weird, or listen to weird music, but generally, if it is too obnoxious, he will turn it down, and if the smell bothrs you he opens a window. 

30 % are road ragers / east block true man . You know,. stereotypical tough guys, who will be tatooed, silent, and if pressured, will tell you how they tortured a guy once and try to forget how good it felt to crush his windpipe with their fingers. ALL, with out exception, have seen all the rambo movies, and can do chilling impressions. Someone that's ""connected"" got them the job. They will know the speed limit by heart, because they are the guys all the GTA players wish they could be, as they use anything on the road to their advantage, telling you how this is nothing, back in 95 in bosnien herzogowina, he already drove 2 ton jeeps like this through a warzone full of snipers, untill those damn serbs blasted away his buddies head with a machine gun, and he had to run them over, and now he can hear the screams, but he is not going to a doctor, oh no, doctors are for women and injuries that require more then the tools in his toolbelt. 

The remaining 10 %? Normal, everyday guys. Of whom about 3 % happen to be female. 

Yea. I hold a taxi driving male to the same status that I hold a restaurant waitress. It's the kind of job that hires you with minimal qualifications. The kind of job you can do even if you have nothing else. 

So, I do not mouth off, I only complain if it is extra heavy, and I try to take it up with the driver rather then mouth off to the bosses and try to get them fired. And you know what? 

The wildest tweaker, the most turban wearing habib, and the true men respect that. They thank me profusely, because fuck yea, they need the job, and more writeups, and they would have gotten fired. 

So, that Female only service? I support free business, I really do, but if all you have to offer is women only drivers, then feck, think about the following: 

Taxi driving is the most diverse job on the planet. you meet people of all ages and races there, and most of them are dirt poor, and are getting treated worse then fast food workers. 

So, of course, if someone wants to not get into a normal taxi, how about we check them for systemic racism? 
Oh, yea, you know, in the papers, I read how black guys want to rape the white women, and how indians allways do group rape, and russian guys, the even use tools....

Of course, they are not racist, of course they are not priviledged beyond belief, they just prefer to be driven by, you know, acceptable women, you know, non scary people, preferrably of their own race. ",Meistermalkav,t2_5mn5y,29,0,reddit4

>A __hackney__ or __hackney carriage__ (also called a *cab*, *black cab*, *hack* or *London taxi*) is a [carriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage) or [automobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile) for hire.  A hackney of a more expensive or high class was called a __remise__. 

>In [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), the name *hackney carriage* today refers to a [taxicab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab) licensed by the [Public Carriage Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Hire) in [Greater London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_London) or by the local authority ([non-metropolitan district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-metropolitan_district) councils or [unitary authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_authority)) in other parts of [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain), or by the [Department of the Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Environment_(Northern_Ireland\)) in [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland).

>In the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), the police department of the city of [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts) has a Hackney Carriage Unit, analogous to taxicab regulators in other cities, that issues *Hackney Carriage* medallions to its taxi operators.

On the other hand, however, there are men out there who are physically weaker than a toddler and there are women who are physically stronger than a 6'4, 210 pound man. There are exceptions to the rule, there always is, but it does not happen often.

My last comment, however, is about how our society, thanks to modern feminism, preaches that women have to be afraid of EVERYTHING under the sun when crime rates have been at the lowest they have ever been.

I think the simple truth behind modern feminism is, in virtue, a very good one: Feminists want a world where women are not the victims of anything.

Not really seeing a problem with this.

Look, I'm not one of those utopian capitalists who slobs the market's knob, but sometimes market solutions work, and this is one of those times. The idea that companies will refuse to hire competent women in ~~2014~~ 2015 simply because they're women is absurd.

So: HeBrokerage is artificially limiting its ability to hire competent brokers and will have to compensate with above-market compensation to attract talent and pass those costs on to its customers. Now, either there's a real competitive advantage to hiring men, or there isn't; if there isn't, then customers will see that HeBrokerage costs more but doesn't deliver results, and HeBrokerage will fail.

The feminist angle on this is that HeBrokerage will have an unfair competitive advantage _because of sexism_, and that advantage has to be artificially removed, but there's not much evidence to support the feminist position.",guywithaccount,t2_cpl35,2,0,reddit4

This implies that they are *losing money* by failing to do so.  Don't confuse your micro and macro economics.  A single firm can't realistically attract more drivers without also paying it's existing drivers more.  You seriously think that shrinking the profit margin on existing customers in order to shrink the overall pool of customers is a smart business decision?  Everything here depends on marginal cost and price elasticity.  Taxi service is an interchangeable good and there is no added utility in having a female driver.  It's nothing more than marketing.

You're confusing business strategy with profitability. The best business strategy will be the least unprofitable, yes, but that doesn't mean that it guarantees that they will get enough revenue from that to make up their costs and actually turn a profit. The piece of data you're missing is that they're not profitable on weekends at the moment because they have too many cars to run and not enough drivers to service their customers.

Raising prices will allow for improved supply and better enable them to match their supply to their customer's demand. There is no guarantee, however, that they will be able to service enough customers at that price to stay profitable as a business at that time. They might only have 5 cars on the road at the current price, and be able to get 10 cars on the road at the market clearing price, and that might still not be worth the cost of maintaining the fleet and support personnel during that time.

icxf3tz,t1_icx3eqq,2022-06-19 09:38:37,MensRights,"Oh I'm sorry, are we casting for worst case scenarios?

Then no. Mens fear with feminists is that they'll end up abused, assaulted, accused, and disbelieved that any of the above is possible. Probably in prison since incarceration rates are several times more than that for women.

Less fear of direct death, more fear of having the rest of your existence be a tortured Kafkaesque nightmare where everyone believes you're a monster by default. Kind of like what you apparently believe given your ""venomous snakes"" example.

Context: Have been in an abusive relationship. Yes that included physical abuse. No I'm not going to elaborate on the details to assuage your next dismissal (""how can a woman hurt a man, she's tiny compared to him"" was I believe what one said). It was bad. *Really* bad.

Of course, feminist theory maintains that such a thing isn't really possible doesn't it? At least not without it fundamentally still being the male's fault as instigator:

> DV is intimate authoritarianism & if people could begin to see abuse as that-- an expression of an ideology/values system rather than as a personal failure or tragic but inevitable deviance-- they would also see the dire necessity of survivor-centered approaches to challenging it.

> As Bell Hooks said, ""the more accurate term for domestic violence is patriarchal violence because it reminds us that violence in the home is directly connected to male domination""

That's from a thread on r/feminism by the way. And if you tell me that bell hooks isn't one of the most important figures in modern feminist theory and literature, I'd call you a liar. And it's not a mischaracterisation either, it's not exactly a surprise she was writing news articles condemning the Central Park 5 when everyone else was suspicious about what was going on (to her, it was innate to men. Racism couldn't possibly be a factor).

icxb15z,t1_icx91bq,2022-06-19 08:36:18,MensRights,"I'm guessing that's to the last point. So: 

If a couple have sex, and the woman doesn't want to be a parent, she has the following options (many of which can be done unilaterally without including the partner in the decision):
  
* caps or diaphragms
  
* combined pill
  
* condoms
  
* contraceptive implant
  
* contraceptive injection
  
* contraceptive patch
  
* female condoms
  
* IUD (intrauterine device or coil)
  
* IUS (intrauterine system or hormonal coil)
  
* natural family planning (fertility awareness)
  
* progestogen-only pill
  
* vaginal ring
  
If any of those fail, she (currently) has the right to abort up to a certain point in the pregnancy. If the doctors are anything like the ones in the UK, they'll remove the man from the room to make sure there's no undue influence on the decision when talking to the woman. 
  
If she forgoes the multiple contraceptive and abortion options, she is able to give the child up for adoption. In the US, she can even use ""safe haven abandonment"" laws  to abandon the child at a police or fire station, no questions asked. This can all be done without any consent of the father (who may want to be a parent). 
  
Now let's flip it: a couple have sex, and the man doesn't want to be a parent. His options are:
  
* condoms
  
* vasectomy
  
If either of those fail, he is on the hook for 18+ years of child support for a child he didn't want. [Even if the conception came about through statutory rape of the father](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/). 
  
If a man wants to be a parent (or not), he needs the woman's cooperation. If a woman wants a man to be a parent, she doesn't require his cooperation at all. That is what unequal reproductive rights looks like.",EmirikolWoker,t2_7ky1i,15,0,reddit1

Explain your reasons for tipping the waitress $10 - that in your experience, wait staff have difficult and stressful jobs and that you were simply trying to express your appreciation for their hard work, and that you would have tipped a wait staff who has done a good job regardless of whether they are male or female. And that gender does, and didn't, make any difference you.

Let them know in the letter that their action frankly constitutes something actionable in a court of law. You were reprimanded without being given the opportunity to hear your side of the story, and that you were/are extremely disappointed at the immaturity of the waitress for jumping to the conclusion that you were hitting on her. And no, she didn't assume that you were 'flirting', she assumed that you were hitting on her, otherwise she would not have made a complaint. 

After you send the letter, then you go into the supervisor's office and proceed to repeat the contents of the letter and lecture them for a good fifteen or twenty minutes, explaining to them that they have made a mistake and you are willing to overlook their mistake, but that you expect better behavior from them in the future.

Im a guy and this was a female cashier at the time. We didnt have any stores open for her to manage at the time so while she was being trained to be a manager she was going to be a assistant at some other store until one opened up for her to take over.  


At some point near the end of her training my boss came in and said we needed to talk. I was sort of excited at this point as i thought maybe i was getting a raise finally. We go into my office and she informs me that i had a sexual harassment complaint against me after asking me a bunch of questions about my new wife and I's relationship. I had very recently gotten married. This sorta blew my mind. I was young and recently married and my relationship was awesome. This chic for whatever reason thought i was hitting on her or what i think happened after quitting years later for a better job and getting more experience with shitty people is she thought she could get me fired and take over my store.   


Either way what happened is i had her transferred out of my store immediately. My boss even before talking to me knew it was highly unlikely and had met my wife who was going to school not very far from where i worked. Im not a ugly guy, wouldnt say im super attractive either mostly average, wife is a little more attractive than myself and the person i was training was straight up unattractive (only noting this as seen a comment here where someone said you may be ugly).

There are no rules for life. Using this as an example of why you wont be nice or tip or whatever because ... women ... is garbage.

Your post lacks any context to her reaction or your history with her. Something about your gesture was enough that she had to talk to someone about it.

The $10 tip was not the issue -- it was everything else that caused the situation to be misread in some way by her. You made an error in reading the social cues that she was (likely) trying to politely and indirectly give you in whatever quantity. Rather then coming off as generous or thoughtful, you came across as a creep. Certainly at some point she said ""no that's not necessary"" and you insisted she take it. Or maybe you have made advances to her in the past and she has ignored you because she is not interested.

You are not a bad person for making this error. You shouldn't feel sorry or be sorry for what you did. Your actions prior to the event and your reaction (post) is also normal. But you should learn from the mistake if you want a different outcome in the future.

From your post, I assume that you work at the same place she does. If so, then you know there is an appropriate time to ""tip-out"" your coworkers who share your shift (or whatever the normal tipping practice is for your workplace). You went to work on a day you normally had off so you could approach her and use this ""tip"" as an excuse to engage with her. It backfired badly. OR maybe I am way off and she is pure evil - to that I would ask why on earth would you have gone out of your way to give her $10.

My advise, think more about the cutes she was sending you that you missed. Learn from it. Find someplace else to work, she may gossip to others and you don't want to rehash this. You will likely be labeled ""creepy"" by your other coworkers and find it difficult to recover from that.

Lastly, I don't see how this post is a MensRights issue under Rule 1. or maybe I take reddit to seriously.",eric_in_cleveland,t2_z6eae,-2,0,reddit2

So I was like ""Hey, I could come by and say hi some time!"" and I was freaking out at how funny it is that we are in the same place. She went quiet for days..

Then I got a message from the moderator of the forums ""DON'T TRY AND MEET UP WITH OUR FEMALE MEMBERS, SLIME!"" huh?? I was a shy, withdrawn, anxiety striken Autistic guy who even a quick ""Hello"" and a smile would be difficult for me and I was gonna beef up the courage to do that.. Nope..

This is the attitude of the ""counsellors"" on Mensline. They do not believe that the men that call are victims. 

""About half the men will hang up pretty quickly, says Sarah*, who coordinates the service run by No To Violence, the peak body working with men to end men's family violence in Australia.""

These men hanging up would be the men that are being blamed for the abuse they're facing.

Men need a service to call that will be believed. Not a service that already assumes they're the perpetrators.

I was speaking to the current situation where the majority party in the Australian government is no ally of men as they perpetuate toxic masculinity. Not to mention their extensive records of misogyny towards even female members of their own cabinet. 

Now I don't agree with policies which refuse the service of any one gender (and simply because of gender). If it is a capacity issue and the feminists can solely choose one gender or the other, I'm not surprised they'd choose females. Remember, before there wasnt even a service to be denied from to begin with.

fpf966d,t1_fpf6tjc,2020-05-04 04:00:26,MensRights,"Okay, so firstly, toxic masculinity is a smear word and the whole concept of it is a broken one, just like toxic feminism.  When you conflate the actions of shitty or bigoted people with masculinity or femininity you are attacking an entire sex.    It does a disservice to the concept of masculinity and femininity, and also offloads individual responsibility to the responsibility of a ""class"", which is part of the reason why there are some satisfactory arguments to be made that Feminism is modeled off Marxism, but I digress.

Initially you argued that the ""centre right party that puts in place misogynist policies while still harming men?"".  Then when I challenged it, you shifted it to saying that the men themselves are misogynistic.  Whether the individuals are misogynistic (or misandric, as we have seen as well) or not I don't disagree with but it's secondary to the original topic for discussion which is the policies and systemic bias against men.  And for the record, I pretty much despise the entire government in Australia and have yet to see an example of any good and altruistic public servants.

So my first question stands unanswered, and I'll elaborate this time in brackets for further clarity; how is the current system (such as policies and laws and systemic bias) misogynistic?

In terms of (I'm paraphrasing here) the concept of justifying Feminism choosing women if there is a capacity issue then sure, that doesn't surprise me either.  Thus far I haven't seen any evidence that there is though, and even if there were, they are still misrepresenting themselves by claiming to advocate for Equality.

As for some feminists being misandric; there's a bit to consider here.  Who are the real feminists?  The regular people who believe that feminism is about equality and truly care about men and women equally, and call themselves feminists?  Or the one's who wrote and championed the Declaration of Sentiments (1848)?  Or the one's who write the policies and change laws?  Karen Straughan has a great write up on the ""Not All Feminists Are Like That"" defense (otherwise known as NAFALT), which is predicated on the No True Scotsman fallacy.  My personal belief is that if regular people who claimed to be feminists did their research on how/what the three waves of feminism said, believed, and accomplished... They wouldn't call themselves feminists.

I gather that your response to my second question can be summed up in a couple points:  they choose women in situations that are potentially restricted by capacity because they need to, and that doesn't disprove that they are not about equality, and also, the people who claim to be feminists who write men out of laws and policies or are misandric are not true feminists and shouldn't represent the movement.  If that is essentially what you're saying (and please correct me if I'm wrong in my summary as I don't want to accidentally strawman you or put words in your mouth) then I respectfully disagree and do not accept that as evidence that Feminism is about Equality.

You wrote about being a victim of Domestic Violence and facing discrimination by the police who refused to help and threatened to investigate you knowing you were a male victim.

Domestic violence under Australia law:

> What is family and domestic violence

> Any behaviour that‚Äôs violent, threatening, controlling or intended to make you or your family feel scared and unsafe can be considered family and domestic violence.

> https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/what-family-and-domestic-violence?context=60033

Discrimination against victims is unlawful:

> In Australia, it is unlawful to discriminate on the basis of a number of protected attributes including age, disability, race, sex, intersex status, gender identity and sexual orientation in certain areas of public life, including education and employment. Australia's federal anti-discrimination laws are contained in the following legislation:

> Complaints of unlawful discrimination can be lodged with the Australian Human Rights Commission and relevant state and territory agencies.

> https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/human-rights-and-anti-discrimination/australias-anti-discrimination-law

> Australia Human Rights Commission: Make a complaint

> https://humanrights.gov.au/complaints#main-content

> What is the scope of the right to an effective remedy?

> Both the UN Human Rights Committee and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination have stated that the right to an effective remedy encompasses an obligation to bring to justice perpetrators of human rights abuses, including discrimination, and also to provide appropriate reparation to victims. Reparation can involve measures including compensation, restitution, rehabilitation, public apologies, guarantees of non-repetition and changes in relevant laws and practices.

> https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/human-rights-and-anti-discrimination/human-rights-scrutiny/public-sector-guidance-sheets/right-effective-remedy

> Duty of Care (Vic)

> A duty of care is a legal obligation to avoid acts or omissions that could foreseeably lead to harm to another person. A breach of a duty of care that leads to harm to someone amounts to the tort of negligence. In Victoria, the law of negligence is governed by the Wrongs Act 1958, and by the common law. While in some circumstances it is clear whether or not a person owes a duty of care to another, in other situations it can be difficult to establish.

> https://www.gotocourt.com.au/civil-law/vic/duty-of-care/

This may be general fraud, as well as commonwealth program fraud as local police receive federal money to provide police protection to domestic violence victims without discrimination.

Australia fraud laws:

> General Fraud

> Fraud can be committed in numerous ways and span the range of Commonwealth benefit programs and assistance available to the Australian community, as well as the Australian taxation system. Because of this, fraud prosecutions are diverse and fundamental to protecting Commonwealth resources so they benefit all Australians. 

> https://www.cdpp.gov.au/crimes-we-prosecute/fraud/general-fraud

Anyone may report crime to the Australia Federal Police:

> Emergency contact

> In an emergency, call Triple Zero ""000"" for attendance by police, fire or ambulance.

> Non-urgent police assistance

> For police assistance where there is no immediate danger or to report non-urgent crime call 131 444.

> https://www.afp.gov.au/contact-us

Australia anti-discrimination laws include Commonwealth Agencies:

> 26  Administration of Commonwealth laws and programs

> It is unlawful for a person who performs any function or exercises any power under a Commonwealth law or for the purposes of a Commonwealth program, or has any other responsibility for the administration of a Commonwealth law or the conduct of a Commonwealth program, to discriminate against another person, on the ground of the other person‚Äôs sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status, marital or relationship status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy, or breastfeeding, in the performance of that function, the exercise of that power or the fulfilment of that responsibility.
				   
> Sex Discrimination Act 1984

> https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2023C00003

These may be false accusations manufactured by police as part of an ongoing policy of harassment and discrimination against male victims of domestic violence causing loss or risk of loss including access to children, access to property, equal treatment under the law, etc to those crime vicims.

In Australia, false accusations are a crime. Here is one defense attorney firm offering services:

> False Accusations ‚Äì s 314 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)

> Being accused of making a false accusation can be a devastating blow to your reputation and future.

> https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/criminal/offences/fraud-charges/false-accusations/

> General Dishonesty Causing a Loss is an offence under Section 135.1(5) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.

> To establish the offence, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that:

> You caused a loss or created a risk of loss to another

> You did so dishonestly

> You knew or believed that a loss would occur, or that there was a substantial risk of a loss occurring, and

> The loss or risk of loss was against a commonwealth entity

> https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/criminal/legislation/criminal-code-act/general-dishonesty-causing-a-loss/

Loss includes suffering, including knowing your child is being abused as a consequence of fraud:

> Loss

> Loss is damage, detriment, or suffering flowing from the act or omission of another. It is once this loss occurs that an action for damages or compensation can be brought. A common example of loss is that arising in personal injury cases. If you have suffered an injury that prevents you from working, then you may have suffered a loss of income. If you win your case and prove that you have not received income for a certain time period, then you will be entitled to compensation for your loss.

> https://www.lawright.org.au/legal-information/personal-injuries/damages-and-loss/

These potentially illegal acts may be the basis of a class action lawsuit in Australia:

Australia class action:

> Class actions are firmly established as a means by which a large group or class of persons can bring a claim in Australia. The amounts claimed are often large, proceedings are procedurally complex, legal costs are significant and adverse publicity may be significant.

> https://www.ashurst.com/en/news-and-insights/legal-updates/quickguide-class-actions-in-australia/

I wish you the best of luck in your search for justice.

I know, hand on heart, that I didn't cause or meaningfully contribute to any of this, in fact I've had a hell of a lot of shit and disadvantages to deal with myself, as a man, and I've never blamed women for it (even if I should've).

But the fact is, I'm not responsible for these supposed sexism-induced hardships that women complain about. I believe in the right person for the job, always. I've never been a handsy cigar-smoking 1960s CEO, I've never been a 19th century politician. It's not and will never be my responsibility to make up for that, even if *were* universally true that benevolent sexism is somehow negative discrimination (and not protection or benefit) or that women have always been oppressed, denied freedom, and kept as pets.

So I don't take kindly to suggestions that I should be blamed, punished, or further disadvantaged for it.

I'm a grown adult. I'm responsible for *my* actions. Not that I have a choice in the matter, because nobody listens even if I explain all of the ways I've had potential and decades of my life kicked out of me, that's still apparently exclusively on me to deal with. If I start a ruck at work and I get fired for it then *I* fucked up. I don't get a free pass because ""patriarchy made me do it"" (even if, by feminist logic, *it did*). That's what happens when you're granted a role: you also adopt the responsibilities which come with it, whether you like it or not. It comes as a package deal. You want paying? You want respect?

frgk6hw,t1_frgilco,2020-05-22 16:04:16,MensRights,"Just gonna leave this here. Not my own comment, so please don't bother replying:


So this is probably pointless but i'll try and articulate to this subs posters what the problem is by using two comparatives terms for the same phenomanae.

Toxic masculinity V Restrained masculinity.

Masculinity is viewed by men as an internal driving force, something akin to a soul though not particularly spiritual.

If a man cannot express emotions because of societal expectations, there's broad agreement this is a problem and bad. The objection people have to the term toxic masculinity to describe this is that it is ascribing the problem to the masculinity rather than the restrictions placed on it.

While the former term casts masculinity, even a subset of it, in a negative light, the latter places emphasis on the restrictions and casts masculinity in neutral or positive terms.

This is why people claim you are shittalking masculinity and/or men. Because that is in fact what you're doing by using the term.

It casts masculinity as something that has to be policed and changed rather than liberated.

&#x200B;

Comparing these two terms for the phenomena being discussed highlights the problems with the term toxic masculinity as well as why everyone other than members of your very particular movement finds it offensive and anti-male. Insisting people don't understand what you're discussing is missing the point, because you've clearly not understood their objection either, and that's because you're discussing masculinity differently. You're all viewing it as a set of gender norms, and they're viewing it as an internal driving force. This is where the ""And you're wrong"" comes in:

There is a wealth of literature for thousands of years on how masculinity is an internal driving force, and the mens movements of the past few decades adopt this view. It is not for a womens movement (feminism) to up and decide to use the term to describe this thing about men in a way that doesn't jive with mens understanding of it, and then expect men to conform to their new usage.

&#x200B;

So if you want to discuss toxic gender norms, use those words. But if you use the word ""Masculinity"", you're referring to an internal driving force, not gender norms. Everybody outside the feminist cult understands this. You're being misunderstood because you're divorced from the rest of the species on how this term is understood, and you're using it in a way that is alien to men. That in itself is pretty ridiculous and offensive, that you think you can just up and decide to change the meaning of a word quite important to men.The problem isn't that we don't know what you're saying. It's that YOU don't know what you're saying when you use the word ""Masculinity"".

As such, when you use the term ""toxic masculinity"", you are in fact referring to something internal to the man and how it causes their problems, not to societal expectations. You are in fact victim blaming. And it's a ridiculous and presumptuous kind of appropriation for you to think you can come along and redefine masculinity and what it means in order to cast it as societal rather than internal, despite almost no men liking your movement or how it behaves.The double standards have also been highlighted, as has how this term in effect demonizes masculinity (Again, rather than the restrictions on it).

All of this in conjunction convinces people you're a hate movement actively malicious against men. I don't take that view. I think you've behaved presumptuously, arrogantly, and with no self-awareness over the term masculinity, that you've not really grasped the nature of peoples objection to your usage of the word toxic in relation to it, and that you're convinced that people ""Aren't understanding"" and ""aren't listening"" rather than wondering ""Am I just being incoherent?"". If you'd wondered the latter, you might have looked into why and realized the problem.

&#x200B;

Again. If you wanted to discuss toxic gender norms, then you should have done that. If you wanted to discuss restrictions on masculinity, then you should have used terminology to reflect that. Instead we got this garbled mess. It's also worth noting (Again), that mens movements have discussed this for a while, so the arrogance and misandry involved in the terms history is there too. If you really gave a shit, you would have read up with mens movements before throwing this garbage around. As a comparison, it's like up and deciding you ""care about native americans"" and then running around spamming a bunch of ideas about them they disagree with and find objectionable, all while never having consulted any.

&#x200B;

But the ridiculous part about that is that most women do all of the thinking, planning, and worrying about the outcome of things because they want to be able to rigidly control everything in order to mitigate their anxiety or ensure that everything will be ""perfect"" according to their own personal opinion of how things should be.

They'll spend weeks meticulously planning what they're going to serve at Thanksgiving and mulling over each of their choices, comparing it to events that they've been to in the past or the tastes and preferences of all the guests that they've invited... 

If you want me to plan Thanksgiving I'll be able to hammer out a list in the next hour of the various dishes I'm going to serve and the ingredients I'm going to need. Although I might forget something and have to do a bit of last minute shopping... I'm not going to worry about it because it... doesn't... fucking... matter... that... much.

I can't speak to women's lived experiences growing up. I'm not sure whether this need for strict control over everything within their household is a function of personal pride (ie - Need to be better than friend/relative/mother), wish fulfillment (ie - Spent their adolescent lives dreaming about throwing lavish parties and being a social butterfly), or anxiety about the event.

That's what they mean when they talk about ""emotional labour"". They seem to believe that everything in their lives needs to be meticulously scheduled, planned, and itemized instead of just dealing with situations as they arise. Sometimes it can be helpful to have someone who's ""keeping track"" of what needs to get done, but it often ends up going completely out of control in a desperate need for control that ends up tiring them out... annnnd then they complain that they're doing ""all the emotional labour"" when in reality, they're doing work that didn't need to get done in the first place.",FiveMagicBeans,t2_4dan8,83,0,reddit3

Being able to empathize, have sympathy, connect emotionally, be mindful of yourself and of others, have patience, manage emotions, communicate feelings, etc.  So doing emotional labour, is performing tasks related to emotional intelligence.    


This would mean that generally speaking *she* is more aware, considerate, and supportive of his *emotional* state than he is of hers.  *She* is patiently dealing with the fallout of *his* emotions.  *She* is the one who expresses more empathy.  *She* supports him in his emotions and feels like he doesn't support her.  She is mindful of his emotions when choosing what to say (which can often require patience, as emotions can be unreasonable).

If a woman suddenly is unattracted to her husband (e.g. he cries when his father dies) she may tell him ""I never loved you, I never orgasmed during sex it was all fake, I never found you attractive"". 

In the moment she will feel strongly that this is true, even if it really isnt. As a consequence she will feel angry for all the times she was nice to him or respectful towards him over the years. Suddenly there is a massive debt of emotional labour which appears out of nowhere seemingly, as history has been rewritten. 

All those times she was nice and feminine were a lie, and fake, and so emotional labour, since you the man were ""never truly masculine"", as she has seen you at your weakest moment.

A woman who is submissive to and in love with her man will never bring up emotional labour. She loves to feel useful to him, it feels incredible. She will want to bake cookies and be soft and sweet. If you try to stop her she will be hurt or insecure. You must allow her to feel valuable for her to feel loved and secure.

Its when she loses respect suddenly everything will be emotional labour. She will resent her husband and saying ""hello"" will be emotional labour as she hates him and is disgusted by him. Being in the same room as him will be enough to anger her.

More likely it's a combination of three different factors.

1) Their primary female role model (their mother) was a stay-at-home mom who was responsible for the management of the household and had ultimate authority over these types of decisions. She maintained a clean house, planned all the family's major events, and was ultimately ""in charge"" of everything. Since she's the person who they looked up to from an early age, this behaviour and these expectations have been firmly ingrained in their sense of ""what's right"".

2) Women's slightly higher propensity for neuroticism combined with their heightened sense of contentiousness causes them to experience elevated anxiety relating to unplanned changes to their schedule or a lack of self worth when things don't go according to plan.

3) They consciously want to be the person in control. It contributes to their self esteem to be the person making all of the decisions, and their self image of being a competent home maker who is taking care of their incompetent spouse makes them feel valued.",FiveMagicBeans,t2_4dan8,2,0,reddit3
jwdrvlo,t1_jwd4hrj,2023-08-16 03:19:54,MensRights,"I'm glad that you and your husband have found a comfortable medium and that both of you have chosen to share the burden.

But this comic still fails to understand the fundamental point that a significant amount of this 'mental load' is garbage that women are allowing to live in their head rent free out of an instinctive desire for everything to be perfect.

To use the comic itself as a decent point of reference... there is absolutely no reason why she can't have the father cooking the food for the children and greet her friend at the door... all it would take is to say ""Honey, can you watch this while I'm..."" and a reasonable partner would do so. She's making a choice (though perhaps a subconscious one) to do multiple things at once for some reason. 

The man doesn't merely 'expect his partner to ask him', he sees the world in a fundamentally different way. The dishes don't have to get done immediately, the cotton buds can get scribbled onto a list that goes on the fridge and be forgotten, there doesn't need to be a fucking -schedule- for when you order vegetables, there doesn't need to be a post-it for paying for bills, or a calendar item for vaccinations, or a mental note that the kids are growing, or that something needs cleaning.

A significant amount of this ""mental load"" is irrational bullshit born out of a need for ironclad control. It's okay to want to carefully plan important things and when a partner feels that they're taking on too much and their needs aren't being met, they need to communicate and establish a consensus about which things need to be planned and which things are just unimportant crap (nobody needs to plan to buy the damn mustard, you just add it to the shopping list and then forget about it until you're going to the store, nobody needs neurotic hyper-vigilance about their selection of condiments, nobody is going to starve to death without mustard).

Spouses just need to work together to establish routines and to emphasize each other's strengths. From a statistical and psychological perspective women are sometimes more prone to negative emotion and far more conscientious than men. Whether this is nature or nurture is debatable (despite this comic's desperate insistence that it's entirely a learned behaviour) but in the end people need to work together as a team as you and your husband are doing... rather than growing to resent each other for perceived slights.",FiveMagicBeans,t2_4dan8,5,0,reddit3

The women who routinely complain about the ""emotional work"" they're doing are people who insist that they need to keep track of everything and plan things in advance. They do this because that's how -they- would prefer to live their lives (for a number of reasons). 

It only becomes a problem when they insist that their way of doing things (meticulous planning) is the ""right"" way to do things, and then decide they're going to shoulder the emotional baggage of those plans without effectively communicating to their spouse.

The way to ensure your emotional needs are a priority is to communicate those needs to your family... but doing so means that you also have to be open to changing how things are being managed and let go when the rest of the family doesn't share your view. (Most women complaining about ""emotional work"" aren't willing to do so).

Regardless, your point's still valid. There are women who are legitimately doing this for their family, but in those instances they've likely communicated appropriately with their spouse about the work involved, **arrived at a consensus**, and aren't the ones complaining about emotional workload.",FiveMagicBeans,t2_4dan8,15,0,reddit3

In particular, it means we don't know how to *Process* our emotions.  Generally speaking men have fewer tools because men are taught emotions are weakness.  We're taught ""men don't cry"" and displays of emotion are stoic failures.

fjl2qb8,t3_fduess,2020-03-05 20:06:27,MensRights,"Hate to say this but this chart is a bit misleading, and the title is inaccurate. (using 2019 data below, but shouldnt be too different)

Bottom line: hours worked only explains part of the wage gap. The difference between ""all income"" earned between men and women isn't 56 to 44 as the title suggests.

~~The full time labor force in the USA is 56% male and that is what the number on the chart is representing. That number does NOT account for differences in average hours worked.~~ The fact that men worked 56% of total hours does not account for the fact that there are more men in the work force, and that number includes all workers, not just full time workers.

The difference in hours worked among full time workers is 43.5 hours for full time working men vs 41.1 hours for full time working women. As a ratio this is 51.4% hours worked by the average full time male employee vs the average full time female employee. Full time working men work about 6% more than full time working women (your title suggests more like 27% more)

Among ALL (non agriculteral) workers men work on average 41 hours per week and women work on average 36.6 hours. This number is heavily skewed because of the large percentage of women who work part time. According to the BLS 20M women worked part time compared to 13M men. However, the ""wage gap"" only compares full time workers so these are not the correct hours to compare.

Simply put, you cannot explain away the wage gap with only hours worked, although it is certainly a factor. For a more detailed breakdown of some of the main factors that go into the wage gap here is a write up I did: [http://rollfordamage.net/index.php/2018/04/10/a-guide-to-equal-pay-day/](http://rollfordamage.net/index.php/2018/04/10/a-guide-to-equal-pay-day/)

Seriously. If you could pay women less to do the same work, men would be replaced with women. Its basic economics. The reality is men work longer hours, have fewer gaps in employment, negotiate more aggressively for salary and gravitate towards different competencies than women. All of those things are variables that the wage gap myth doesn't bother to control for and every one is a personal choice.

Also no one went around using their ""power"" to force anyone to hire a male plumber or engineer. It's not discrimination that men and women make personal choices to develop different competencies and its gor sure not discrimination to employ a workforce that is 60% male from a population of applicants that is also 60% male.

If you look at union jobs, they pay everyone exactly the same. But most union jobs are hourly, and women end up working less and therefore making less.

The earnings gap for union work is exactly the same as non-union work though.

You can blame this on child care to an extent but lots of times this is actually the mother's choice; she prefers that her husband works extra (and/or pays child support) so she can stay home and ~~watch Jerry Springer~~ ""take care of the kids"".

Before having kids women usually work fewer hours than men.  Which is fine. It would just be nice if a) people were honest about this, and b) men were allowed to do the same thing without being punished for it.

You're using statistics that include a different number of men and women, and driving them down to a number that really should be average per man or per women. It's extermely misleading.

The problem is the wage gap is the average for women and average for men. Women on average earn 77c for every dollar a man earns. Your numbers are aggregate (and not even true). You're saying women in aggregate earn 77c per every dollar that men in aggregate earn, but you're also not factoring in that men's hours are paid at a higher rate.

You're not understanding why your methodology is terrible. Let me give you an example. 

Let's say there are 10 men and 5 women in the labor force. Let's say the men work 40 hours a week and each are paid $100/hr. The women work 40 hrs/week and each are paid $50/hr. 

The wage gap is the average that women earn 50c for every $1 a man earns. 

Ok but lets use the lauded ""CFOI methodology""

Well the men work a total of 400 hrs per week and the women work a total of 200 hrs per week. NEVERMIND THAT THERE ARE A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF MEN AND WOMEN

therefore the wage gap IS PREDICTED TO BE 50c per $1! dont even bother thinking about the fact that this data is comparing an average to an aggregate!

The data happens to match 77 hrs worked per 100 hrs worked by women in aggregate vs men in aggregate, but that's just coincidence and is an awful predictor of earnings of an average woman vs an average man.

The seemingly rise in male teachers of minority groups is a good thing, as it gives role models to males from minority groups, but this doesn't seem to be representative of anything specific, just that minorities are getting more accepted. The interesting bit is that from what I saw, this decline was for secondary teachers, which tells me two things, that men with higher education degrees have been following teaching less, or that simply, women have gained more openings to higher education, this could mean that women have been getting favored when it comes to those positions, so I think it's a natural process of the old stereotypes about men in education that still persist and women increasingly getting into higher education, not being limited to low teaching positions, like kindergarten and such.",CroissantUser,t2_1424j6,12,0,reddit1

Not to mention that this is a study conducted in England, NOT the USA. You have a decrease of white male teachers, but the article then states a rise in minority male teachers.

The charts are also cut to show a more dramatic effect by not showing the graph at zero. It's a trick that people use to portray data in a certain tone that fits an agenda. See this chart:

https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GEsjMbTPiZM/maxresdefault.jpg

And the words used are also strange. It hops the numbers around and doesn't really give you the totals, so it makes you work for it. If I did my math correctly, a drop of 17% would make the previous total of white male teachers at 75,294. Comparatively, the amount of minority male teachers was at 10,451 at the time.

>'The decline in the number of white male teachers is concerning in areas where there is a prevalence of under-performing white working-class boys.'

This quote by the researcher is also very strange. Does he really think that minority men cannot teach or be role models to working-class white British boys? Can men only become role models to boys of the same race?

What I will say is concerning however is the dramatic drop of male teachers in general as the drop of white male teachers of 12,800 still far exceeds the increase of minority male teachers of 3,516. So that part is important.

But the problematic graphs, the strange quote and the lack of disclosing full numbers really makes me feel fishy about articles coming from this website.

I support issues that pertain to men, but I am also critical in how data is presented to the public.

Fucking stupid. This opinion paid for by malignant industries.

>Get the state out of it. 

So fucking stupid.  The reason teaching has become women dominated is because of your corrupted agency capture policies that pay teachers poverty wages.  The only people that can afford to be a teacher are people that would otherwise be a housewife.  

>Let education be controlled locally. 

It is.

>Schools that cannot find parents willing to pay, either their own money, or  state issued vouchers, should fail. 

This opinion paid for by the corporatist oligarchy that has destroyed your future.

>Such a free market 

Imaginary zero-sum concept that corporations sell to convince useful idiots to act against their own interests in favor of those corporations‚Äô ability to profit off them.

>would both raise standards 

Nope.  

>and cuts costs enormously. 

Nope.  Making people do vouchers is just making the state pay more for shittier service.  Same thing as making Medicare and Medicaid operate on top of the for-profit insurance system.  You‚Äôre just making the state pay cost-inflated prices that are determined by a plunderbund of price-fixing corporations who are incentivized to get as much as possible out of the system.  

The people you trust laugh privately about how stupid you let them make you.


>Education systems are appalling 

In the shitthole parts of the US, yes.  Because of agency capture and corporatism.  

>and will remain so as long as the people in control are not directly answerable to the parents and students.

In answer to your response, its not helpful for this issue of discrimination against men in teaching positions to point out personal experiences that include a small sampling when there is a clear and verifiable issue of widespread discrimination.

I think the most apt comparison would be the discrimination against homosexuals that was investigated years ago in the Boy Scouts of America. What they did was call up Boy Scout troop leaders around the country and have a conversation with them about their homosexual child joining. The vast majority of those they spoke with told them that their child would not be welcome in that troop. It was an overwhelmingly negative response.

That doesn't mean it was universally negative though, their study pointed out that several troop leaders were very encouraging and helpful. Stating they would be happy to welcome their homosexual child into the group. Nothing is ever absolute in terms of social issues like this. There will always be pockets or communities that somehow avoid the discrimination and have a positive and welcoming environment.

But that doesn't mean that the discrimination isn't very real and a very serious issue that the vast majority of individuals have to deal with.

Thing is, everyone I've spoken to who has worked in China for longer than a year has the same story to tell. The cost of living is cheap, the transport system is great, but you dare not say anything bad about their culture no matter how true it is, and there's only so much China you can take before you need a break.

The stereotypes about their driving are true. They're so racist they don't see it as a problem. They believe China is greater than what it is (biased news media definitely helps here).

Guess what. I'm none of that. And I'm ""white"". Never lived in a house, mother never made over $40k a year and she even got an associates degree in the early 2000s. 

Fast forward to my adult life, I ended up on the floor of my then gf who I impregnated and moved in the day my child was born, I slept on the floor in a 6'x6' space which housed all my allowed space including storage for clothes, a spot to sleep, and a desk for school. I had no job, was a senior in HS dropped out after a month into classes and worked shit jobs. I started from the bottom. I made choices that negatively influenced my starting point. But now? I make more money than BOTH my parents, I finally have my own place after fighting for 8 years. I've been in two long term relationships, the first one from age 14-21 (7 whole years) and the current one from age 22-26 (current, 4 years). I have my own business, I own a $35k truck, I go to college (which BTW I don't get fancy grants n shit cuz there's so much out there for non whites) part time, I work full time. You have to learn to invest in yourself. People are the problem, not their environment. You cannot do the same thing as other people and expect a different result. Einstein calls that insanity, I call it stupidity. 

The funny thing is that ""white privilege"" y'all complain about is that ""1%"" its not a majority of white people at all. If you were in the workforce above entry level and tried to land a career you would find not only being white but a white male is less favorable because dIvErSiTy! You cannot give favoritism to one group and not the other, that's inequality. I showed you PROOF whites die more often in the last 4 years than blacks, our average in a year was y'alls WORST year which happened ONCE. When you hear the term trailer trash you know what I think of? White people. Then Mexicans. Never blacks. When someone mentioned the ghetto its automatically black. When you mention gated communities its always whites. 

I haven't personally experienced white privilege, and I'm 26 and I live in a freaking liberal state where its all about being progressive, BLM, hire minorities, women are victims and not independent but are independent at the same time, the land of tens of thousands of educated young people who have a high unemployment rate both pre and post COVID. 

Do you ever ask yourself why the grass is greener on the other side? I came up with an answer by the time I was 20. 

""It's greener on the other side because it's fertilized with bullshit"" meaning it might look pretty but it's not real. It's astro-turf. Wanna talk about how many athletes are white? They make BANK. The ""white sports"" are hockey, baseball and NASCAR. Yet blacks are playing where the money is at, football and basketball. Predominantly black. By a long shot. Did you know there's companies that exist that hire only women or only black people, its illegal yet its allowed. 

At least when it comes to black people a first racist thought isn't ""i wonder if they're legal"" in reference to Mexicans and people with a Spanish background. Would you rather fear deportation or being accused of a crime when being in the wrong place? For my job, I go to residential areas. You bet your ass the shittiest jankiest places are communities of Mexicans and white trailer trash. Black people are a rarity in my experience in those situations. Black people are associated with gangs, cop killers. Organizing large groups with intent to threaten not only innocent people but government employees is NOT smart. It's fucking stupid. Straight up. More poor choices. 

Now, there are two types of black people. There's ni**as and ni**ers. One is respectable, gets a good job, raises a family and DOESN'T LEAVE, buys a decent car and contributes to society. The other? The mentioned gangbangin criminal. Take your pick. You can ALWAYS change your path. Especially if you haven't gotten involved in criminal activities yet. Not all black people are bad, but you're on the notion ALL white people are bad. You're like a trump hater, orange man bad. At least you're consistent and SO fixated on getting white people to say what YOU want them to say. Don't you think that comes across a little OPPRESSIVE?!",,,2,0,reddit1

That's demonstrably untrue. The anti-women part is completely untrue and the non-white racism part is greatly overstated. The fact that feminism is anti white male is demonstrably true. 

I wasn't advocating mensrights being pro-white, I was explaining why there will inevitably be some overlap of pro-white guys being pro mensrights, and vice versa, when feminism is so anti-white. A lot of male issues are more pronounced in minority communities. 

I'm tired of hearing about race. It's such a marginal issue that you can't even do anything about in terms of policy, yet it occupies so much time and attention. Especially in the US and increasingly here in the UK, thanks to changing demographics. One major reason the US is so fucked is because it's prioritised race over class, it's why it doesn't have a worker's party or basic shit like healthcare and worker's rights.

It seems to boil down to ""hiring a girl presents an additional risk and we must minimize all risks therefore we would benefit not to train or hire women."" Not exactly palatable, or really even a good reason not to hire someone. I agree, ""good engineers"" is more important than ""women engineers"". 

But let's flip this into something that may help visualize. I'm assuming the risk you are concerned about is that your relationship with a young female engineer could be misconstrued as non-professional and she could accuse you of something that costs you your job. I will also assume that, in that situation, you would be the victim of a horrible misunderstanding. It's a bit catastrophizing to assume that it would cost you your career, HR isn't going to side with a woman just because woman. 

But onto the converse of my point: if a woman is statistically more likely to create an issue by raising an allegation, you could look at the reverse and say that men present a statistically higher chance of getting upset and initiating a physical altercation. This is a risk that does not present itself nearly as largely in female candidates (though they are still capable, no doubt) that is a statistically larger risk in male candidates. 

To me, these risks are both so incredibly low that they can be disregarded entirely when it comes to considering if an engineer should be trained or hired.

Yet fun fact Elvis lived in a trailer park in a poor part of America where he lived among black people and he had nothing against black people. If you want to see an interesting video on it watch white privelege in music by Adam Neely.

There definetly was a lot of racism going on in the 50's. R&b being called ""nigger music"" or ""devils music"" just because black people often made it. That's bullshit man, music is music wether you like the music or not. It was often the parents thinking this but the younger generation of teens broke this. Elvis actually did quite a lot to help fight racism because his music sounded both black and white. He was a huge r&b and gospel fan. Sadly there were dicks and there will always be dicks. 

Don't judge a group of people by the dicks in them. If I would do that all black peoe would be gangsters, all white people would be crackheads and junkies, the asians would be totalitarian cunts and all middle eastern people would be terrorists.

People often say white people wearing hijabs, those african necklaces and north african robes is cultural appropriation so it is not a bad example.

Hate post malone, but still he's not racist for just making music he thinks is fun to make even if he started out making folk songs(his songs are still shit agreeing with you on that one). Hiphop is created by black people and I think black voices often sound better on hiphop, but it is not like black people own hiphop and white people need permission to make it, that would actually be quite racist and hypocritical.

I hate braids and baggy clothing personally, but it is people's damn right to do so wether they're white or black.

Frankly it often comes across to me that people think well we have/had bad things happen to us now you need to experience racism and hate. That just fuels the whole race war. The fun thing is that yes black lives matter definetly and yes there's definetly racism going on. But fighting by saying no you can not say that, do that, wear that, make that, have that is just going to fuel hate. Definetly in such extreme countries like America where there is a lot of racism going on.

The rationale of falling in just strikes me as bizarre.  Don't people look?  I always look.  Even if I'm not sitting down I look to make sure the seat is up first.

Assuming everyone uses the toilet for number one and number two at a rate of 70% and 30%, respectively, by everyone leaving it the way they used it, men already do more work than women! This is also assuming putting it up and putting it down is equal amounts of work.

This, though, I am completely fine with, because what the fuck. At times I find myself reaching for the seat when it's already up and I have a moment of ""holy shit this is a thing I do all the time,"" because it's such a motor reflex to move the seat at this point. How often do you hear people complaining that they need to remove their pants? However, by asking men to always put it back down you're shifting the already discriminating male work load to a workload of ""2"" in 7/10 visits, while the female workload is reduced to 0 for all visits, which makes no sense.

This I have not done the maths on, though, but I assume everyone leaving it as they used it is the best distribution of work possible, while everyone putting it down is the most biased one possible. This would probably need to be graphed, though, also with respect to different rates of pissing (I have no idea how accurate 70/30 is).",WhipIash,t2_7egwu,42,0,reddit2

That's the most insane argument I've heard in a long time. I don't want to lick a toilet seat because other people's arses have touched it. In fact, there are a lot more things I'm *not* willing to lick than I am. Fairly certain I haven't peed on all of those.",Amunium,t2_4j4tj,1,0,reddit2

If all men suddenly *chose* to sit down, yes, but that's even more hypothetical than the question. It's downright absurd to think all men would suddenly get that thought - hence what you're asking is for men to accommodate you/women.

>More hygienic

Very, very slightly more hygienic. Arses don't tend to be the cleanest of body parts, and they still have to touch the seats. Urine is sterile in the bladder, and is only added bacteria from the urethra, so in terms of hygiene it doesn't really matter much - toilet seats are not dinner plates, no matter what.

>And about people not giving shit about what I think about stuff, I don't really care.

Exactly. So how does your suggestion in any way relate to the question of why men should put down the seat for women, while women shouldn't put it up? That's what I don't get.

>it's about order, or tidiness

No it isn't. Now you're referring to the *lid* of the toilet, and that's not what's being discussed *at all* - it's the seat.

Some people's natural instinct is to analyze the situation to see how and why it happened. Well, if you find something that the girl did/didn't do and point it out, it can be taken as victim blaming. 

For example, victim blaming: If you had locked your car, your laptop wouldn't have been stolen. It implies it is the victims fault that someone committed a crime against them because they didn't take precautionary measures. That it is their fault for ____ bad thing. 

This is often conflated by various people with the following;

One of the ways to prevent this from happening again is to take steps to prevent car break ins. Lock your car and don't leave anything of value in it. 

Which isn't victim blaming. Its advice for how you can prevent future thefts. The feminist narrative is that women shouldn't have to take precautions to prevent rape. Which simply isn't realistic in todays society. It is never the victims fault for a crime or bad thing happening to them, however, it is their responsibility to ensure their own safety. This is true for everyone about every type of crime. 

Some really don't like that reasoning, and try to ensure that anyone who does such is labeled a victim blamer, thus their opinion is invalid and can be ignored. ",,,22,0,reddit2

People in the developed world seem to have a fanatical obsession with avoiding bacteria at all costs. What they completely don't understand is that they NEED to be exposed to harmful bacteria on a regular basis or the risk of getting seriously ill increases. That doesn't mean pouring vials of anthrax down their throats or anything but it does mean that avoiding all germs at all costs is actually UNHEALTHY. Like muscles that don't get exercised , if your immune system doesn't adapt to what are otherwise fairly innocuous bacteria , eventually it can't fight the newest strains.

Whatever germs are present in the average toilet bowl are NOT going to affect anybody provided they aren't licking the damned thing. Even compromised immune systems are safe from whatever is floating around the water line. As long as it isn't typhoid or cholera etc. , there's virtually nothing to fear. Further , the fact is that that toilet seat isn't exactly a vacuum-sealed unit. If it's floating in the air , putting the seat down won't do much to stop if from floating further afield. Besides that , your main point of exposure is going to be from sitting on the seat and touching the handle as well as the the toilet paper roll itself. 

TL;DR -

1)Don't be so paranoid , people.

2)You NEED to be exposed to bacteria or it BECOMES dangerous.

3)Putting the lid down won't do a damned thing to stop the bacteria anyway.

Similarly I would not expect anyone to have to carry a gun or a riot shield to prevent a rape. But avoiding a dark alleyway, a park really late at night, being on your own and very drunk, or wearing revealing clothing... it just seems pretty sensible to me.

I don't expect women to wear burkas and I wouldn't tell me wife ""you can't wear that, it is too revealing"" - but then again, my wife isn't devil-may-care with her body.",,,1,0,reddit2

cao1mgf,t1_cao0xix,2013-06-22 15:09:00,MensRights,"> My understanding is that rape victims are chosen primarily by their perceived ability to defend themselves, as opposed to any kind of sexual attraction feelings.

Well, this would be the case if we were talking about what guys traditionally think ""rape"" is defined as.  However, with some women referring to sex they later regret as ""rape"", this gets completely muddled.  

I once made the mistake of talking to a ""rape"" victim who regretted sex she had.  She goes into a story about dressing up in her super flirty outfit, flirting with a guy, touching him, kissing, rubbing her hands on his crotch, taking him back to her place, undressing to tease him, ripping his shirt off and rubbing him, giving him oral, letting him do the same, rubbing his privates on hers and then ""regrettingly letting him violate her insides for the next 4 hours"" with his penis and then again in the morning when she woke him up with more oral.  At no point did she make any signal or communication that she didn't want to do that.  In fact, it seems perfectly reasonable to assume she wanted to have sex, given all of the earlier activity.  But, she somehow remembered her husband at the last moment and didn't want to go any further, but she did anyway.

The slightest suggestion that she alter her previous behavior in any way was met with aggressive ""victim blaming"" rhetoric.

I just don't know how to even talk about this now.  My brain tells me to not let her get away with calling herself a rape victim, but I fear feminists will consider me a misogynist.  I wish I could help someone not be in a negative situation, but any attempt to suggest different behavior is met with hostility.

Luckily, for the guy in this story, the girl didn't want to press charges, because she didn't want her husband to find out.",dances_with_wargs,t2_c4i27,1,0,reddit2

Let me try asking it.

Question-
How can men who faced or are facing false cases (by women) can come together and spread the information or raise the voice and help everyone who is raising the voice?

We lack unity.. many NGOs doesn't support the other. Not sure why.

But if we all on individual capacity, get together (say example on twitter) on a global level, we can really make our voice heard.

How to achieve that or atleast start working towards it.

Women are bullies by reputation destruction. This is a highly robust and validated fact. Women arent angels. They're people. And people like to bully. When bullying is rewarded by the desired outcome, or at least not punsihed, it will happen again, and get worse. Its like when people look at a little bit of porn and then go deeper and deeper. And Im not arguing pro/con porn, just how it works for a lot of people.

If we had a system that was ""wise"", we'd probably have a system that seems monstrously unfair, like solomon cutting a baby in half. A system devised wherein any accuser is believed, but has to take 1/10th of the punishment of the acccused at conviction, might entirely eradicate false accusations.

It might even eradicate frivolous true accusations, the kind where the boy tries to kiss the girl on a date, he makes contact, she pulls away, and then calls the campus police for his sexual assault later on. He was supposed to make a move. She's punishing him for not being attractive enough.

if she receives a slight injury for it, she decides whether or not the harm to her was big enough and harmful enough to accept the punishment she'd also take.

That's the only way I see sexual assault/rape law truly working properly, because there's one critical thing everyone misses about this issue: Sex is an intrinsic and necessary function of humanity, and the only thing that distinguishes it from the horrific acts of violence known as rape are the mental state of both individuals.

That's literally all it is. When something is so common in people and when it looks almost identical to a massive criime, false positives are easy.",Burglingthebrownlog,t2_8uyyyup0,57,0,reddit3

The fact that universities enrol, and graduate these people based on nothing more than doing that is a ringing indictment of the status quo, and I guess the main reason why we're here, but I think if you go and do your bachelors' in, say, chemical engineering you might find it's less bad.

The reasons intelligent people are ignoring the plight of men are complex and varied. It's essentially a positive feedback loop created by our innate psychological tendency to protect women. We want to protect them so we focus on their issues, so the news focuses on female issues, so women get confirmation bias which makes us all more motivated to solve women's issues. Talking about men's problems reduces finite attention on women's issues, which leads to efforts to discredit men's issues.

It's all an ugly mess of people operating in patterns that serve their immediate interest. They aren't taking the time to actually look down the road and consider the consequences of a large group of disenfranchised men. On the contrary, lacking the inherent bias we have for women, the issues of men have led to the demonization of men. When women are disenfranchised, it's oppression. When men are disenfranchised, they're lazy, incompetent, and/or incels. 

The basic bias for women, and lack of it for men, leads to a perpetual inability for most of our population to actually wrestle with the problems plaguing half of our society. And because of the mechanisms that these behaviors and beliefs perpetuate themselves, I don't think it's possible to course correct, because even the most intelligent among us are vulnerable to cognitive bias. As long as they refuse to recognize their bias, they will believe they are being completely reasonable.",UbiquitousWobbegong,t2_4atqpddp,7,0,reddit4

I spent significant periods of time as a NEET in my 20s. In my opinion, it's a fairly predictable response that young men are having to a society that doesn't value them. I don't really begrudge young men for opting out due to that.

However, society better reevaluate its priorities soon if it doesn't want to fall apart or drop into very poor living standards. Men are required to invent, build and maintain. And if they aren't valued, if there isn't a *reason* for them to want to do these things (wife and children usually) many will simply opt out or become dangerously anti-social. In the end, society will face the consequences of it.

You're totally incorrect on this. That is *the* type of job that is not being filled right now. We have a massive shortage of those workers. It's why labor costs have soared and businesses that deal in logistics, food service, construction, and the trades are unable to stay staffed.

This year we are seeing massive layoffs of white collar workers because the tech industry over-hired during the post-pandemic boom. We have much less of a white collar shortage than blue. Most places that employ blue collar workers are struggling to maintain services because they can't find people.

d2wpxr2,t3_4i9smp,2016-05-07 20:53:10,MensRights,"When I went to middle school, there was a girl in my class who loved attention and particularly hated one male teacher who didn't put up with her bullshit. 

One day, she had put double-sided tape on her shirt over her breasts and was sticking anything she could find to them. Scissors, a ruler, construction paper. She was causing a big disturbance. She found a plastic bag, stuck it to her chest, and was running around the room yelling until the teacher grabbed the bag and ripped it off as she ran past.

Her plan had worked. She turned to the class screaming ""you all saw it! He just touched my boobs! He's a pedophile!""

My teacher turned white as a ghost as it dawned on him what had happened. His frustrated attempt to restore order to his classroom; this one simple mistake; was going to ruin his life. He walked out of the room without a word, leaving the class to ourselves for the remainder of the hour. When the bell rang and we opened the door, he was still slumped in the hallway with his head between his knees, crying.

It was over for him. He tried to get ahead of it; to explain what had happened before he could be reported. He even had the entire class to back him up and explain that he had done nothing wrong. But none of that mattered. Enough people either disliked him or just wanted a piece of the drama that they corroborated the girl's story. Whomever makes those kind of decisions concluded that it wasn't worth the risk of allowing him to continue teaching. He was fired, lost his teaching license, and even went to trial.

I'm not sure if he did any jail time. It doesn't really matter, I guess. Either way, his life was ruined. But that look on his face when the girl first made the accusation was haunting; the look of a man who lost everything in a fraction of a second. No more job, his wife would leave him, and he would even have to leave town because of all the rumors floating around. The girl fed off the attention of being a victim... At least until she dropped out at age 16 to support her 3 kids, but never showed any remorse.

Who cry a bit and the government gives them what they want. According to UNICEF, if you yell at your kid, it is emotional harassment. I would be curious whether wives are legally capable of emotionally harassing husbands. There are also complaints that competitive environment hurts girls, so it is better to exclude males from classes in certain cases. So in many occasions females are spared of the difficulties of life by the system. If they choose to go to the STEM fields, quotas might help them. If the quota is not reached after the university declares the score limit to be accepted, what will the university do? They calculate the number of women who have to be accepted to meet the quota. Say the ratio has to be 250:50, but only 35 females made the cut. What happens is, the 15 males with the worst scores are sacked, and the top 15 females **not meeting the score** are accepted. In the 40s there was a similar system in some European countries. If a country had 4% Jewish population, then there could be no more than 4% Jewish people at any given major. Afterward some folks came up with other ""progressive"" ideas.

They might have a compensation at the future in their jobs too. In certain fields, employees will be more likely to hire women, simply to be more ""diverse"" workforce and in case of a discrimination case, point fingers at the women in employment. And AFAIK they are more likely to be given holidays when they ask for it. And after they are in their jobs, the invisible oppressive hand is still working. It creates that sexist wage gap. I came across a study conducted by two women, who authored such studies as **[On Pay Gap, Millennial Women Near Parity ‚Äì For Now](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/12/11/on-pay-gap-millennial-women-near-parity-for-now/)**, **[Breadwinner Moms](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/29/breadwinner-moms/)**. Now this two women made a [study](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/29/breadwinner-moms/) back in '13 about how much time do men and women spend weekly on work. Both paid work, child care, housework, and leisure. Here is the table for ages 18..64:

 | Men | Women | Diff
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:
Total | **45.6** | **45.2** | **0.4**
Paid work | 33.8 | 23.9 | 9.9
Housework | 9.3 | 15.5 | -6.3
Child care | 2.5 | 5.8 | -3.3
Leisure | 33.7 | 29.0 | 4.7

The same table with children less than 18 years old:

 | Men | Women | Diff
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:
Total | **54.9** | **53.0** | **2.0** \(the error is in the source\)
Paid work | 38.4 | 21.6 | 16.8
Housework | 9.5 | 17.7 | -8.2
Child care | 7 | 13.6 | -6.5 \(error in source\)
Leisure | 27.7 | 25.0 | 2.7

So it is totally clear that men worked more on average for money, then women, in 2013. If you happen to find out what percent is the average women's paid work hours of the men's, you get 70.71%. So if men were paid the same money on average for overtime, then women are even overpaid according to [John Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsB1e-1BB4Y), since he states one LadyBuck is ¬¢77. So the **Equal pay for equal work** is actually **Equal pay for their work**. See?! That's me being politically correct! BTW, the video is dated 8/25/2014. And it talks about 2013 data.

So the question arises, is it worth to be an MRA? As I see the numbers do not matter. The commander in chief is happy to be a white knight, by taking money out from the mutual piggy bank and giving it to women. It seems to me that there are some hypotheses that never change, and politicians act on them all the time. One is that women are oppressed, were oppressed, and will be oppressed. The second is that women always got it worse. Say I'm the 18 year old John Doe living in Austin, TX. The government clearly does not care about me, and women will be always more important. So I have to smarten up. I say, I support bringing in more immigrants from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Libya. I conform more to their norms, than the average female American. So if they will be the ruling social group, they will start by ""fixing up"" things with women. Why would John Doe care about women being raped on the open street in broad daylight, for not being covered up? That's not me being raped. And as long as not one family member of mine, why should I be involved? Supposedly we already live in a rape culture, so women won't really notice the difference. Say in 50 years the US will be an Islam caliphate. Women are not allowed to drive on their own, can't divorce without permission, there's no alimony, if my wife beats me in the head with a frying pan for picking her favorite scarf from the laundry instead of the oil rag, to wipe the Camry's oil pan, what will happen? I can call the police, without fearing that I will be arrested despite every single evidence and the testimony of my children. I can initiate divorce the next day. I won't have to pay alimony, and our relationship will be totally terminated for both of us. Just like a modern western woman can do today. I will probably get custody of the child, since she was beating on me. I will split up the custody nearly equally. Say she's mad at me for holding her responsible for her own actions, and reports me, claiming I abuse my daughter. Police comes investigates, she tells that I never even raised a hand at her mother when she charged at me like a maniac. My son's testimony backs her and my version. She is put into prison for 2 years, and loses her job in the process. Her parents in the process distance themselves from her due to social pressure. After 15 months into her term, the children visit her less frequently. She develops depression and hangs herself in her cell. There are no news reports about a convicted felon who was found guilty of DV and false accusation. The world moves on. Now is it an equal system? No. Is it a fair system? No. Do I have the liberties, I had in the old system? No. But as a male, do I have better outlook for my life? Sure. At this point I recall the old system, women having all the privileges I can recall but wanted more based on bogus claims. So I say to myself,

>*""Why should I feel bad about anything, than my actions? I did not take part in the overthrow of the democratic government. An equal society was clearly not enough for feminism. This system will for sure move the same direction. But it takes so much time, that my son will have almost the same opportunities in life. Marriage, divorce, parenting will be the same for him as a modern western woman had back in the day. If feminism needs privileges for as compensation of the ancient past, my son can do the same, by saying that his father and grandfather were unable to have a choice whether or not they want to be parents, whether or not they can be financially independent from their ex-wives or ex-girlfriends, and were arrested even for DV despite being on the receiving end.""*

And even if I'm wrong about all these facts, I'm still a patriarchal rapist monster, a member of an obsolete oppressive system. That system already existed at the high point of feminism, so I was pretty much born into it, and social pressure formed me into this person I'm in the future. Other people force me into a role, so I bear no responsibility. And speaking of my daughter, she will have nearly all the rights, as her brother. Okay, for adultery she will probably get harsher sentence, than my son. But in the past of feminism, men got more time for the same crime in general. So that's social justice my friends, to compensating for the past. And if I remarry, I can still help out my wife in the kitchen, cheer her up when she is in a bad mood, go to the opera, buy her a new dress for her birthday. Take her out to the sea so we can swim in privacy, even naked. I can help financially with her studies, if she is missing the founds. I can still handle her as an equal peer, and life long partner. And if god forbid one party cheats on the other, every connection and responsibility is terminated by the state, and we both can have a clear start. So why should I worry if feminism is driving the nails into our society's coffin? What simply happens is we move from one extreme to an other. If we are incapable of acknowledging that the battle has been long won, we will always swing between the extremes. That's so simple.

7 and 8 boys are in an awkward transition phase, they go back and forth from being immature to wanting to be heard and respected or treated like ""men.""

Intermediate is a tough balance to strike.

I keep things (sometimes irritatingly) calm, ask a student in question to speak to me privately (usually in the hall, door open) and remind them of the classroom expectations.

I had stayed behind after class to get feedback on an essay, it was exam season and it ended up being me, a girl and another boy who stayed back for the discussions. The first lad went first and left, followed by me while she continued finishing some stuff up on her work. I got done and walked out, went to shut the door behind me because it was so loud and busy in the corridor and we were right next to the door, loads of kids hanging around outside it being noisy as hell making faces in the window etc. I have never seen a person react so quickly and so severely in my life as he did telling me to keep that door open, he looked like he'd absolutely shit himself seeing me shut it and the situation it could present.

Teachers are without a doubt an important part of our society. They truly do help shape the future. 

I don't know why, but a lot of women are willing to buy into a feminist sound bites that are just untrue. Back in the 90s, my 2nd grade class was segregated because the female teacher couldn't handle boys. So, we were taught by a student teacher and he did great. Luckily I was too young to really understand what was going on. But now you read all these stories about how medicated the boys are.

A nurse I worked with would constantly hit on me, call me ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù or ‚Äúbaby‚Äù and Inappropriately place her hands around my shoulders or waist; several times she came up behind me and did it. 

I even recorded her saying disgusting stuff to me and presented that as evidence too. Only to be told ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt have had your phone on you during work hours‚Äù and ‚Äúwe spoke to her and she said she was only joking and being friendly with you‚Äù the recording wasn‚Äôt even seriously addressed. 

Well, I finally reached my tipping point a couple weeks ago and confronted her and this is *after* I‚Äôve filed several complaints through HR and the chain of command‚Äî only to be ignored and told it‚Äôs not that big of a deal; just workplace ‚Äúhorseplay‚Äù....

But guess who was just told that by confronting her on my own and in front of my fellow nursing staff (and respectfully so I might add) that due to my behavior she filed a *single* complaint against me (which was immediately handled) saying... ‚Äúshe felt threatened by me‚Äù and ‚Äúafraid for her safety due to my ‚Äúrage filled outburst‚Äù.... 

All I said and calmly so... ‚Äúwas please stop touching me and speaking to me in the way you have. It‚Äôs inappropriate and makes me uncomfortable. I do not like it and it‚Äôs not a game‚Äù to which she cried and made a scene as if it was my fault for taking offense.... 

Smh, this is the world we live in now and I couldn‚Äôt imagine what it must feel like to not even see a stall for ‚Äúmen only‚Äù at your job... I guess it‚Äôs their way of telling you to... piss outside... if the restrooms are full.

I suspect they did this is for two reasons. First, women tend to frequent the restroom more than men. Second, the perception that women are cleaner than men. The first one I'm fine with, the second everyone knows is a complete falsehood. Both bathrooms get disgusting and I've heard from many the ladies restroom can be much worse.

NB: they are 3 cubical toilets (sometime a toilet is 2 urinals) with real walls and full doors (not US toilets) in a big room. And big rooms are segregated. So it's not really like OP because it wasn't think the same way.

But it's well thought, when you have 2 men toilets next to each other, the one below, above or both is for women. So whatever your gender you can find one nearby. And I think HR and secretaries (80% women HR and 100% in secretary) are trying to get openspaces near the women toilets.

I haven't heard anyone complained about this. I worked with a woman on the first floor, near men toilets (women's one are above, below is the reception) and before leaving, if she had to, rather than go up one level then down two, she used the men's one and I haven't heard any complaints either, she didn't come to the urinals to check.

lets put it like this:

if 4 men are waiting for the rest room, 1 of them would be waiting outside, where as if the gender was reversed, all 4 women can go w/o any problem.

lets put it like this so your simple mind can understand....instead of gender, lets use race for those stalls.

Most feminists do hate men's rights and MGTOW though. And I've noticed that most trad con women as well as MRA women also hate MGTOW.

And that is my point. A men's rights activist who calls a man going his own way an incel cannot expect to be taken seriously and not be called an incel himself by another group. You see, as far as blue pilled majority is concerned we are all incels. It's just amusing to see an MRA deploying the same shaming and dismissive tactics on MGTOW as feminists use against MRAs.

>I don't really like MGTOW subreddit because despite originally focusing on getting men's rights

MGTOW has never been about men's rights. If you go to that subredit expecting that, of course you will leave disappointed. It's been about shedding traditional men's roles and responsibilities, nothing more.

>more and more people joined which brought in an influx of incels and people who genuinely hate women

I disagree with that statement. Of course you can read into MGTOW content as ""woman-hating"", but the same could be said (and is being said) about MRA content really. What you read as ""woman hating"" on that subreddit I read as mostly just search for validation of their philosophy. For example if there is a post that reads something like ""Look at this bitch who claimed she 'need no man' but also collects child support"". This could be interpreted as hating on a woman, but it also could be read as a warning to not participate in the institution of marriage leading to this kind of situation.

For that matter there actually a lot more content that can be read as man-hating on that sub. Something like ""Another simp marries a past-wall bitch after she rode the cock carousel for 15 years. What a moron"". They are clearly hating on this man and his choices right? Not really, just validating their views.",illCodeYouABrain,t2_bs3h3,5,0,reddit3

It's interesting that on the same page is a link to an article about air pollution causing 3.2 million new cases of diabetes a year. I wonder if the study took account of this?

>Researchers looked at data from 7,065 Canadians who were tracked over 12 years. What they found was that women who consistently worked 45 hours or more a week had a 63&#37; greater risk of diabetes compared with those who worked between 35 and 40 hours a week.

If you follow the link to the study, what they propose is...

>How might these results change the focus of research or clinical practice?

>‚ñ∫ Promoting the regular workweek of 35‚Äì40 hours might be an effective strategy for preventing diabetes among women.

I normally would not have an issue with this as long as women get paid for the work they do, but with this *wage gap* horseshit being pushed as a major agenda item, I'm afraid I'll have to oppose this in principle.

But working long hours doesn‚Äôt increase your RISK. Just as living in a high crime hood doesn‚Äôt make you more likely to commit a crime (if you‚Äôre law abiding, you won‚Äôt) nor does living in a gay area make you more likely to engage in homosexual sex.

##The Facts about the Gender Wage Gap in Canada

The gender wage gap is the difference in earnings between women and men in the workplace.

It is a widely recognized indicator of women‚Äôs economic equality, and it exists to some extent in every country in the world.

A 2015 UN Human Rights report raised concerns about ‚Äúthe persisting inequalities between women and men‚Äù in Canada, including the ‚Äúhigh level of the pay gap‚Äù and its disproportionate effect on low-income women, racialized women, and Indigenous women.1

Out of 34 countries in the OECD, Canada had the 7th highest gender wage gap in 2014.2 To learn more about economic inequality in Canada, see",tenchineuro,t2_3nrxdp,5,0,reddit4

It certainly *seems* like a problem that could be related to sexism or similar factors.

The answer, of course, is because women don't work in dangerous jobs as much as men, meaning they're rarely in a position to die due to a workplace accident, so it makes sense that a higher percentage of women's workplace deaths would be due to someone deliberately trying to kill them. It's just something that isn't immediately apparent just from the raw data.

To isolate for workplace shooting, you need to remove other causes of death from the equation. Total number of men murdered, total number of women murdered, and compare those % of total people murdered to the breakdown of hours worked by sex.

EDIT 2: I have drafted an email that all here may use to send in if they wish:

Dear Mr. Keating, 

I‚Äôm writing you to urge you to redress some false implications made in an article you recently authored titled: ‚ÄúMurder is the second most likely way for women to die at work‚Äù.

While the title (by itself) of your article is indeed correct, you implicitly state within the 2nd paragraph of the article that the issue of workplace murders ‚Äúdisproportionately affects women‚Äù. This is simply not true and is not supported by any honest statistical analysis. A correct interpretation of the stats (once you normalize the numbers and correct for total hours worked) suggests that men are 1.4 times more likely to be murdered at work than women, and more men are murdered at work each year than the total number of women workplace deaths.  

If you‚Äôre trying to draw readers attention to specific domestic violence issues facing women, or to the injustice of fellow journalist comrades being gunned down in their offices at the hands of violent fanatics, then your efforts are obscured by playing games of gender politics and pushing statistical misrepresentations. Readers deserve better than this.

Wrong. The problem with the article is false correlation and reversing causality. The rate of death does not influence the rate of murder, but the reverse is true.

It's not. There is not a two way causality. Think of the correlation between ice cream sales and murder. Ice cream sales are higher at times when murder rates are higher. Increased ice cream sales don't cause higher murder rates. Higher murder rates don't cause higher ice cream sales. 

The same is true for the base murder rate. A higher murder rate does not increase the accident rate in jobs. A higher accident rate does not cause a higher murder rate in jobs. When you look the base murder rate outside of the job and compare it with the murder rate while on the job they are within a percent of each other in both sexes.

It's pretty close to 72%/28% ratio. Now their statistics.

I still think ""disproportionate"" is being misused here. 

The word ""disproportionate"" is misleading in every single aspect of this math/graph except when comparing the probability of death by murder with all cause of death considered between genders.

Men do a large number of very dangerous jobs that women don't. Men work more gross hours than women do.

Yes, if one reads the article, it explains the graph, and that's important.  But they choose a graph that visually equates 4,264 deaths to 320.

I don't really care about the gender issue, I just think it's a misleading graph in it's own right.  It's meant to visually stun without conveying much information (easily inserted) to explain itself.  That's what's bothering most people here.  

What if I made this graph?

- 2 women die at work: 1 murder, 1 choke on ham-sandwich. 50% death rate by murder. 

- 50,000 men die at work: 3,500 by murder, 15K accident, 15k autoerotic asphyxia, 16.5k bored to death.  7% murder rate.

In truth, the likelihood of being murdered at work could be equal across genders or even *greater* amongst men, but if women are *less likely* to die from other causes then that style of graph will make it appear that women are disproportionately murdered on the job.

For example, a workplace with 50 male employees and 50 female employees could have 2 male employees murdered on the job and 2 female employees murdered on the job. Equal numbers. If however male employees also saw 8 accidental deaths on the job while female employees only saw 2, a stacked graph like that will show that men only have a 20% chance of being murdered on the job while women have a whopping *50% chance!* Stripped of numerical context, this leads many people to assume that women are being murdered more than men on the job or that women have a greater chance of being murdered even though both men and women are *equally as likely* to be murdered at work.

The *honest* way of framing it would be to compare the total number of women who are murdered at work to the total number of men who are murdered at work.

O right, because every language has the same database of definitions and we just spell our words differently.  It's not like the word could be different in different languages.  That would be too complicated. 

^^^lol

> Speaking about ships the word comes from Old Norse, opening a category of ""slaying that is unjustified by Norse morals"", as opposed to normal slaying.

Not relevant.

> [jurisdiction] ..yes, it is. 

Jurisdiction in so far as who ""should"" be right does not matter.  Jurisdiction in so far as who as the most power, does.  I was too vague before.

> The German legal definition, for example

It's still not the word ""murder"" though.  It's German, with its own definitions, even if they are extremely similar and often used as in translations.  They may overlap at times, maybe even often, but your definition is not the same as the English word ""murder.""  Because in English, it has to be unlawful.  That's what it means now.  

> A term for a crime that is not concerned with justness? Colour me surprised. Can there be e.g. theft of something that's your own? Do firefighters kidnap babies out of burning buildings?

I think a better example would be corrupt cops that are acting with in the law when committing unjustified homicide.  They won't be labeled as murderers by the government.  The law has to draw lines about what is a crime and how to punish for those crimes.  The term is a specific label for type of homicide.  The law is supposed to make it just, but it turns out that humans can be corrupted by power and will act in unjust ways.  Is this all actually a surprise to you?  How old are you?  I'm not sure ""surprise"" is the color I would use.  

> ...I was referring to the ""not even an insult"" part. But I guess we left good-faith interpretation behind us some time ago.

It was a fairly off topic thing to mention anything of insults.  I don't really think it's relevant at all.  It being an insult has *nothing* to do with what I was posting about.

Like 

> And the result was: ""Soldiers are murderers"" is not even fit to be considered an insult,

What the fuck does this have to do with anything?  Who cares?  

The point was that ""government approved murder"" is simply an oxymoron.  That's all my original post was stating, and you are wanting to get into it.  It's a simple concept though.  If it is government approved, it's not murder.  End of story.  German words can be defined differently, but they aren't the English word for ""murder.""  It turns out, words are not strictly bound to the same definition as the word they originated from.  

> But I guess we left good-faith interpretation behind us some time ago.

Are you kidding?  Did you see your own first post in this conversation?  Your point is wild.  ""If you use a different language and also consider war unjustified we can maybe make an argument that saying that soldiers are murderers is not an insult.""  You end with some quote and are like ""and he calls himself a murderer!!"" I don't give a fuck what who calls themselves.  ""government approved murder"" is an oxymoron.

Wrong. The problem with the article is false correlation and reversing causality. The rate of death does not influence the rate of murder, but the reverse is true. It doesn't matter how many men die on the job of non murder causes when trying to make a supporting statement of women's safety at work. You look at the total number of men murdered, the total number of women murdered and you compare that to the total number of men murdered at work to the total number of women at work. When you do that the authors assumed position falls apart.

>3.5% of male murders occur at work.
