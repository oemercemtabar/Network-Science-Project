I've said it before and I'll say it again, Racetrac is a shit company. Worked for them for five years and the amount of doubles I pulled was stupid, and that was before the COVID pandemic. They say company policy is to shut the door and lock them if it's just one person working the store but they heavily frowned on it and would guilt the shit out of people if you did. 

I dealt with junkies, drunks, assholes, one particularly creepy homeless dude and worked hard, thankless hours for barely $12 an hour, and that's after my promotion to management.

Also if 1 person walking out causes you to close your entire business for the day, then Alex must have been the only person there? Like maybe if it's one of those small, in the city gas stations sure, but a nice ass RaceTrac with donuts, glizzys, slushies, and all that extra shit? You can do better than just a single Alex running all of that, wtf lol.   


EDIT: Even still, it should have been easy to find coverage for Alex. At the very worst, I'd expect the manager themselves to cover the shift over completely closing business for the day.

Hiring is done per region, not by store manager, and the amount of people hired is based on sales.

They almost never fire you. Had a coworker get arrested, and return after getting out of jail. You have to actively steal a lot from the company to get fired.

The story goes that this store was short-staffed - pretty common during the first six months or so of the pandemic. Alex decided to walk out during the middle of their shift, for whatever rewson(s) they had. This sign was put up by the night manager, who closed the store - normally 24 hours, but they have to close if there's only one person there (safety reasons?).

This night manager had put in like 80 hours that week, and the company had the nerve to fire them for this sign.

In some places you could walk out on job Monday and interview at a new place the same day, and then begin working Tuesday. If the choice is between extremely shitty and pretty shitty, I'm going to choose pretty shitty.

EDIT: Obviously this is in very favorable scenarios based on location, transport, and other personal/local factors. This was possible for me because I had reliable transport, could reasonably make a commute to 4 different towns, had insurance through my father (under 26), and the restaurant I applied to hired anybody with a pulse. But still, getting another *shitty retail/food service* job within a week of quitting your old one is possible and not unheard of. Especially in the food industry, but for example Walmart hired me immediately, a day after I applied and I was working that weekend. I spent a lot of time jumping ship when it wasn't worth it anymore, and got better pay raises than I would've got being loyal to a job. I ended up not getting some jobs because of my resume later on, of course. I'm too much of a nervous person to completely lie on my resume, but even after heavily editing it in my favor it isn't exactly appealing.",la-bano,t2_1brtfcbz,49,0,reddit2

io35i1w,t1_io2p1fv,2022-09-12 04:56:06,WorkReform,"Succinct, but can we stop associating huge profits with understaffing? Like, shit, you think the most expensive recurrent cost of the subway down the road is two or three employee wages? Staffing costs are an afterthought and a cop out to declining service quality. Large businesses leverage their size and capital to decrease expenses outside of labor, chasing metrics they can show investors. Small businesses chase an ever closing profit margin by cutting staffing costs, their most liquid expense. Either way, the lowest person on the totem pole gets the beating.

Most can afford to pay more without drastically affecting their consumer prices, but the race to the bottom means labor is usually the first thing to be cut.

(This is a simplification, I'll admit, but I hope I made my point. $1000 means a lot for someone living paycheck to paycheck but is a rounding error for most businesses.)",25I,t2_92zr7,28,0,reddit2

Hell even at your $1000/week of pay, as a business owner you'll probably end up paying closer to $1500/week for insurance and taxes. Plus you'll have more than one employee, even if we take a Skelton crew of 5 that's $7,500/week in labor costs **alone**.

So for your building (possibly your second biggest cost, depending how expensive ingredients are) you're only gonna have $5,000-$8,000 in rent, but more than 3x that in labour costs.

Sounds decent enough until you realize I was required to work 50+ hours a week (usually 60+ since we were so short staffed) and had to work every single day for 4 of those 6ish months. 

The pay broke down to probably something like $18 an hour for the hours I was working, plus I was getting called every single day by my employees about something or another, which meant work literally followed me around 24/7. I also had to wake up at 3:30 AM every day to get there at 5 AM to open the store.

One time that he left, he left to go celebrate the reopening of a McDonalds in the city. I guess he finally realized that the teachers are, in fact, not replaceable. I mean, school were literally closed for 5 days because there was no one to work (subs get paid $90 a day, no way they were crossing the picket line for that little money, hopefully they also get a raise). 

I’m also really glad to hear about the reduced class size. When I was a student in that district, all the kids and the desks could barely fit into each classroom. The teachers were not able to give each student the attention they needed. Imagine one person trying to teach AP Calc to 26 kids in 45 minutes. That’s just over 2 minutes per student if you don’t lecture. Every student had at least one question per class and we never got to all of them.

>The Massachusetts Teachers Association (MTA) has stepped in and pledged to help with costs.

Do you even know anything about dieselgate or are you just knowingly spewing shit for the sake of it?

Dieselgate cost VW over $40,000,000,000 in the US alone. I believe $5,000,000,000 or so was in fines, the rest being in forced buybacks, pro-environment investments, and legal fees. 

That $40,000,000,000 was far more than they made from selling the 500,000 affected vehicles in the US was not even close to being profitable, as if all cars were sold at $40k/each it would be only $20,000,000. This is only in the US. VW claims that the scandal cost the company over $34,000,000,000 euros in Europe. I can't find any full collection of the rest of the fines globally, but those are VW's largest markets so the point remains. 


This info was collected via the Wikipedia page: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal

The 40 billion number is not a direct quote from any part, it is a modest estimated sum I made from looking at the various parts. The largest single number I could find was $35 billion being the cost of buybacks and legal fees.


None of this even counts the prosecutions of the executives responsible for it. There are many things wrong about the legal and judicial systems in the US, and globally, but dieselgate was not a fuckin slap on the wrist lol.",HandBreadedTools,t2_ce284njt,27,0,reddit3

The punishment for that violation should be severe enough to make any predatory capitalist dismiss that inhumane idea quickly.  The fact that such inhumane treatment is prevalent the tech industry shows you clearly who really owns this country.  It is NOT we the people.

It's interesting that from the beginning of 19th century capitalism in this country it has always been legal and expected for the Government to send troops to force striking workers back to work.  The Government has that ability and that authority to force workers to work, like slaves who must obey their master.

But the Government has never, not once, not a single time,  sent troops to force the owners of capital to open their businesses in a strike.  It has never sent troops to force the owners of capital to bargain in good faith with striking workers.

That some parts of tech can get away with their treatment of working people is all the proof you need of who really owns this country.

ikdjj86,t3_wofmne,2022-08-15 12:42:58,WorkReform,"From an employer standpoint: We pay a Christmas bonus in Nicaragua, don’t in the US, and I think in Portugal it’s optional. In all three locations we’re figuring the yearly salary and then backing into the monthly figure, taking Christmas bonuses into account. So say we agreed to pay USD 105k a year gross, then that’s what we pay. Whether in 12 payments, 13 payments, or 14, doesn’t impact the total amount.

Expect employers to generally behave like that. What matters is the yearly gross pay and of course the all-in cost with social security, taxes, retirement contributions, and so on. A Christmas bonus just makes the pay a little more “lumpy” around that time, and I can see where people might prefer that vs. being on the hook to save the money all year long. It also benefits the employer though: This is now money that would have been paid to the employee over the course of 12 months but wasn’t, instead landing in a year-end bonus, and so remained working capital during that year. It amounts to an interest-free loan from the worker to the employer. No wonder businesses are on board with this bonus pay.

My background is that I was a salaried employee all my life, and have now been running my own small business for a year, with the first 3 hires in the past 6 months. So I’m seeing pay from both sides of the equation. We are also doing 4 days a week and 32 hours at full pay, because that avoids burnout and is just a better way of working.",yorickdowne,t2_irfgz,1,0,reddit1

hw4el8y,t1_hw3u4lo,2022-02-08 19:29:31,WorkReform,"You would think so, but in my experience, having all that information on a resume just makes employers think that you won't stay anywhere, not that you won't stay anywhere worthwhile. So they don't hire you. 

And if you choose to not list the jobs, employers then wonder what the hell you were doing all that time. You're just fucked either way. So they get suspicious and likely don't hire you, or they give you a shit wage. 

Unfortunately, it seems like the best thing to do is work at a shitty job for a year, and then leave as it shows prospective employers that you'll stick around for some time, even if you hate it. However trading up for pay looks bad because a lot of bosses don't want their employees leaving for better wages on a regular basis. 

Basically unless you get lucky with a good boss, you're fucked. 

So, win the lottery, daytrade, or start your own analytical therapy practice.

Edit : I was wrong, actually. The one good right now is that due to this rona situation, it is sort of an employee's market. Lots of people need workers, some are starting to have their wages reflect demand. The biggest advantage workers have right now is that we can shop around.

hw52mo6,t1_hw3u4lo,2022-02-08 21:56:44,WorkReform,"I appreciate your view here and I like to believe you're right. That said, I can tell you with a fair degree of certainty that many managers, especially managers in the corporate world, will not land on that line of reasoning. To them, if you quit it's because you ""just don't want to work"" or aren't ""jiving"" with the company/team culture, etc. etc. It's always a you problem. I found this most prevalent in minimum wage positions, where they presume somebody's lining up to take your place anyway, and in my former circumstance/location that was true.

There are many possible reasons for this and I won't pretend to understand them all. In essence, though, I believe it comes down to the ol' chestnuts of money and power.

Not all managers are making enough money to buy a Mercedes, but more often than not they're doing a damn sight better than folks making minimum wage. Maybe they went from min wage positions to management, and think by you quitting you're not trying hard enough to better yourself like they did, and they consequently respect you less. Maybe they can't comprehend your financial situation because *they're* doing fine, and if *they're* doing fine then *you* can do fine, and by quitting you're giving up, and they consequently respect you less. Or maybe they're unhappy with their job, and think that by you quitting you're incapable of putting up with it like them, and they consequently respect you less. Or maybe their job is their life, and by you quitting they think you're rebuking their job and therefore their life, and they consequently respect you less. They treat people quitting their jobs as people inferior in some capacity, no matter how arbitrary. The idea of it being a systemic issue with the owner/employer doesn't hold water to them. The company ""provides"" for them, after all. I've met people with thought processes either exactly like the above or similar enough to them. Some genuinely believe it, some are half-hearted about it. The net effect's the same either way - even if they're half-hearted about it, obviously *something* there resonates with them.

Everywhere's different, of course. I've run the gamut of really excellent bosses (normally the ones who are pretty chilled out and come from places of understanding) to bosses like the ones above, and my experience might not be representative to somebody else's. But I've had enough friends and colleagues experience similar things to say it's a pattern, at the very least.

The solutions seem extremely obvious to us, but many of those in power don't share our viewpoints and, perhaps more importantly, don't care to consider our viewpoints (especially when they more often than not require them to change), so it's a tricky thing to tackle.",Dartboard96,t2_1697n2,2,0,reddit3

6 years ago before everyone in our department was laid off for bullshit India reasons, corporate greed reasons, one of my coworkers was late because:

We work in a very large 4 floor office building campus.

We can't take the staircase from outside for example because it's an ""emergency exit only"". That day, we had upper level corp. management visitors. My coworker came in at the same they did and had held the elevator for them, held the door open for them, and so he was like 2 minutes late clocking in.

When COVID-19 first hit my area super bad, we had a co-worker who ended up catching it. Our manager didn't tell us anything, despite this co-worker being someone we all interacted with regularly. I only found out because I overheard a shift supervisor talking about it. Our manager basically expected us to come in and continue working normally even though we could have all been exposed to it.

Naturally, I was really concerned and texted the other co-workers on the evening shift. They all grumbled and complained that they weren't told, but nobody wanted to confront or text the manager about it. I ended up telling him I didn't feel safe working without receiving a negative COVID test result first. The manager was arguing with me at first, but I put my foot down and said I wouldn't be coming in to work until I had a negative test result. I kept my co-workers in the loop of what was happening, and all of a sudden after they realized I was serious, they all started texting him too. They all wanted to get tested before coming back in.

Reading the texts does give a pretty good indication of the relationship between the boss and employee. If the boss is trippin over 2 minutes and sends a text with a screenshot to gaslight the employee, then replies with a stern response, you can get the idea of what kind of boss he is. A more professional and reasonable approach would be to schedule a meeting with the employee and mention being on time.

The barista will still be there; the person who sells gas will still be there; the people who make or sell you your food, still there; the plumber will come to you - the electrician, the house cleaner, etc. The only people who have the potential to work remote are white collar workers --- and that's fine!

 

 

The ironic part is that the CEOs hoping to trap people in the office are usually free to be as remote work-y as they want... does anyone remember that Malcolm Gladwell article that stressed that in-office commuted work is essential?... only to reveal that he works from home himself?? I know he is a writer/author, but the cognitive dissonance is REAL.

 

  

I, for one, applaud people who can work from home. Good for you; you reduced traffic, saved on gas, didn't wear out your tires or engine, saved yourself the opportunity from road rage and potential accidents, and didn't waste ANY unnecessary time commuting. You avoided awkward in-person social interactions at work and perhaps were even more effective at your job without those kinds of distractions. You got to pick up your child from school or daycare, or could do errands without feeling harried from your 9 to 5, or even do your work on the beach. Whatever, as long as you did the job you were paid to do in the end - it isn't your boss's business where you do it if that's the case.

 

 

You would think that CEOs everywhere would be so happy not to pay for a big expensive commercial space to do business, essentially house your employees for 6 to 12 hours a day.

* + discomfort fees
* + job change risk fees 

and then check if the new job proposal is at least 1.1 times the current job earnings. For days in office for example it's +5K annual gross per half hour of trajectory per day in office.

jk5dwd7,t1_jk2na20,2023-05-14 19:05:59,WorkReform,"This is my pipe dream legislation. All publicly owned companies (to start this test, later to hopefully be expanded to all companies) must pay their employees in stock percentage equivalent to what their rate would be. If at the end of the year, revenue didn't equal them making their rate, then they need to be compensated the difference in either additional fractional stock or paid out the difference. All raises would be just additional stock percentage, and the same rules as above would apply. Bonuses must be either stock options, stocks or cash at the employees choosing. Severance packages would be a choice between retaining your stocks, or cash. All employee stock must be Givin voting rights at the same level as any other class of stock issued by the company.

Basically, all companies would need to payout dividends in this scenario, or they would need multiple classes of stock. I really think this would solve multiple issued in both the employment and stock world. It would incentivize companies to have longer term plans, rather than just looking at the next quarter. It would give employees much more say over the company.

Obviously, if you're job is handling physical product and/or classified info, you're in the building. But everyone else? They're at home, even when the executives are going on about ""no more zoom"" and ""everyone back into the office"". It's actually interesting, all the bosses are talking about everyone returning to the office, but generally, no one says shit if 'Bob' only comes into the office 2-3x a month, to attend the one classified meeting and check some logs, but works every other day from home. Similarly, they don't care if 'Steve' comes in every day, but only for 1-2 hours around the middle of the day, and spends the morning and afternoon at home. And 'Joe', who has no clearance and never needs to touch the hardware? No one has seen him since 2020, not so much as a web cam shot, but he calls into every meeting, never misses a deadline, and work quality is high (as usual). I honestly expect it to stay this way for the foreseeable future. Imo, it's the classified nature of defense that helped them adopt this hybrid culture, ironically: it keeps a small rotating cast of people in the office, even during the pandemic, which is *just* enough to placate the bosses.

But there were people who had to be there to get paid and the fucker would do it to them to instead of staying in his office as much as he could.

Half the office floor would get whatever shit he dragged in.  It should be legal to spray fuckers like these with fucking Lysol.  Or at least deduct sick leave for others from Marty's sick leave.  Fucker bragged about not being sick.  He brought in some lung crud that led to asthma complications for me and sent another co-worker to several doctor's appointments.   I paid out about $40 for co-pays for the urgent care visit and prescription.  The other co-worker lost several sick days and had to pay co-pays.  People like that fucking suck.  And managers are fucking stupid enough to reward this bullshit.

The last work lunch we had as a team, he dragged his sick ass into the office and sat down next to me the day before I was scheduled for surgery.  People treated me like I was being Howard Hughes with germs because I asked to switch seats.  My surgery would have been canceled if I got sick and I had a relative who was taking off from work to be my responsible adult and take me home.

And dear god, the lack of natural daylight.  Plus some dumb executive fuck with a window office decided to pain the hallways soul crushing battleship gray.

Like the executive that is too lazy to type so required Dragon on all five of his laptops, that are all personal and don’t have our security on them yet he is allowed to use them on our systems. Or the VIP who was the top earner for the company, didn’t have to follow password rules, didn’t have 2FA on his account or security on his machines and shared his account details with his massive staff. 

They always treat you with utter contempt because it isn’t working so it is obviously you fault. I always wonder how much worse they treat their staff if this is how they treat people trying to help them. Many also think that everyone around them is stupid, including you. They have a problem that takes more than a minute to fix? Well you are obviously stupid and they want someone else “who knows what they are doing”.

I regularly commuted 90 minutes to 2 hours each way, depending on traffic, etc.  My work is computer based and can be done from home.  I have to account for my time spent at work and my bosses can check on my email, etc. to see what I'm doing, so I can't hide it if I'm not really working during work hours.  


My previous job was exempt, salaried and my boss would regularly call me at home, on my personal phone vs. the work issued phone.  To the point where I gave her the ringtone to Helen Reddy's Leave Me Alone, so I'd know not to answer when she rang.  She'd call on holiday weekends for non-essential shit which could wait a  few days.  I had to get a doctor's note after reconstructive surgery from a preventative mastectomy not to work 10-12 hour days and only 8 hours as we were scheduled.  I had to go to HR to document all of this.   


Return to the office involved going back to the commute and they wanted me to still work 10-14 hour days, plus 3-4 hours of commuting time.  And weekends to catch up with admin stuff I didn't get to do during the week.   I burned the fuck out and had a semi-nervous breakdown.   


And they made the mandatory fun bullshit the asshole managing the whole company thought was so important part of our performance evaluations.  You couldn't put food down on the freakin' pantry table because they had puzzles, coloring pages, pencils and other kindergarten shit all over the place.

See [their comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/13gxqws/our_workplaces_are_not_remotely_democratic_weve/jk3sd0q/) and my response. 

That's an insane difference in hourly income. If you assume a $50k annual salary at 40 hours per week it's:

At home: 50000/12/160 = $26, 04/h

In office: (50000-20000)/12/200 = $12.5/h

You're essentially making half the money per hour for no reason.

To make roughly the same hourly income in office you'd need    (26.04\*200\*12 + 20000) ~ $82500 annual salary, a raise of $32500.

* General Motors CEO Mary Barra, meanwhile, is the highest-paid of the three CEOs, making about $29 million a year.
* In a CNN interview, Barra defended her high earnings. She said 92% of her salary is based on the company's performance, and that the company offers profit sharing to its employees. So, her logic went, the better the company performs the more money everyone makes. 
* When the CNN reporter pressed Barra on whether or not the pay discrepancies at the company are fair, the CEO deflected, reiterating only that ""a very compelling offer"" was on the table for the union to consider. ""Not only are we putting a 20% increase on the table, we have profit sharing,"" Barra said.

You still have not explained why my point is no longer relevant. Companies choose to give the excess value to shareholders instead of workers because the shareholders reward the company with large investments when it does so. The workers don’t magically become more profitable when you pay them more.

The investors can pack up shop and move their money whenever they want. Workers NEED their jobs so that they can afford food, so they don’t have anywhere near the same leverage that the investors do. The company must continually reward the investors or they will go to a company that will, but you can’t say the same for the workers. There’s always someone out there who will do your job for less. That is why the company chooses to give the extra profits to shareholders. Are you saying this is not the case anymore?",ZeOs-x-PUNCAKE,t2_701pe4zw,-2,0,reddit1

I mean think about it. Why do office workers who sit around doing nothing for at least a few hours a day make generally 100% more of what a factory/warehouse ""uneducated"" worker would make? It's discrimination. Class discrimination. I got paid 22$ an hour as a year round intern to sit around doing nothing for 66% of the full week, whilst Daniel in the warehouse is making the same or less as me while also working overtime doing physical labor each snd every minute of the week with little ability to advance his career. Next thing you know bam a batch of interns already making more than the warehouse employees just got full time offers at like 40% more starting salary for entry based roles. I've always advocated for the actual labor guys. I'm not by any means a do-er. Fucking give anyone else the money but me to do the heavy lifting because thats just not me.

This is an example of the difference between two strategies for making choices: put the effort into choosing the best option or go with the first sufficient option. For astronauts the first strategy is the best. For picking a place to eat, the second is the best. Which strategy to pick is mostly a matter of overhead but game theory and psychology play a role too.

It's the notion of ""maximizers vs satisficers"": [https://www.psychologistworld.com/cognitive/maximizers-satisficers-decision-making](https://www.psychologistworld.com/cognitive/maximizers-satisficers-decision-making)

So for hiring, filter out anyone who doesn't meet the criteria that are *actually* necessary. Then interview at random until someone seems good enough in the ways that aren't knowable from their resume.Requiring an unnecesssary degree is overweighting credentials in the hope that doing so will also capture the factors that matter but nothing that messy correlates 1:1.

Today, it’s been entrenched in the social consciousness for so long, it’s functionally a conservative premise. To that end, a 40 hour work week is now framed as the expected floor for _everyone_, instead of the primary ‘breadwinner’ for a family.

I propose a new, progressive ratcheting of the social norm to be such:

The provision of minimum subsistence (food, clothing, shelter) should be achievable at:

-	20 hours/week at minimum hourly wage for an able-bodied individual adult.

-	40 hours/week at minimum hourly wage for a small family.

The base rate for unemployment, disability and age pensions should be set at these levels. If additional support is required, this should be readily available.

If you want more than minimum subsistence, you have an incentive to educate yourself to attract a higher hourly rate, or work more hours.

What is considered to be minimum subsistence must be periodically reviewed, and never regressive.

They're all deathly afraid that the whole goddamn system is gonna come crashing down if people on the bottom rung lose the incentive to give 110% in hopes of climbing the ladder to attain better employment.

Minimum wage jobs are usually simple enough that you could pick up some random 16 year old and they'd be able to work there. Workers are very easily replaced, and therefore, cannot really demand higher pay. You have no leverage. You can't really offer more to them because they already don't need much from anyone.
Jobs that pay higher are typically ones that fewer people can do, fewer people are willing to do, are dangerous, etc. Doctors , for example, get paid tons because their line of work is essential and they aren't easily replaceable.
The way to get paid more is to do something that's worth more, not to do something a kid can do and just keep demanding more money for it. I don't think that anyone should be living in poverty, but I also don't think it makes sense to just demand more money for something that isn't really worth much.

This means raising all wages in your business since many will likely be under the “living wage” for your area. This also means that costs of product have to rise to compensate, otherwise the company cannot afford these wages, therefore causing layoffs. It logically follows that rising wages in the grocery store means rising prices of milk. Ergo, people stop paying as much for groceries, income goes down, and to be able to pay wages, you have to have money coming in. Instead of making some pocket money, you might be one of the guys who instead has NO job now.

I’ll also add as a side note that if UBI existed, I probably wouldn’t have a job and I’d just game or read or write or play my guitar all day instead of working.

You put in 5 years and have experience in customer service, supervisory experience, I'm guessing also order management, this also demonstrates you can be trusted to show up and be on time. 

You aren't limited to food service, you can branch out from here. Customer service will still be the easiest to land, suchas retail or hospitality, but you may now also be able to work you way into from desk office environments if that's what you want . 

You can also go to a totally different field. Find a labor ready place and say your excited and eager to get into a trade and don't mind starting at the bottom. You'll probably get out onto a clean up and runner job at a construction site , and if you work your ass off you might get hired on with a legit company. Then you can work towards your apprenticeship, then journey man, then when Starbucks calls up and says their pipes are busted you get to hand them that 200/hr bill plus parts.

2. Starting a business is super expensive and requires a lot of outlay. Between the paperwork (small) and the marketing and reputation building and client seeking, it's expensive.

3. It's fuck or die. Working for a company means you risk losing a job if you're bad at 1 thing. Work for yourself and you lose your job if you're bad at any one of a multitude of things.

I'm probably more conservative in that regard than most on this sub. Don't get me wrong, most employers these days are abusive to employees, either because they can squeeze labor or because the labor market already squeezed pay down for everyone. I have no issue sharing my own productivity with a company that affords me protections and productivity opportunity. But my gf is having a hard time making ends meet while working two jobs at a master's level of education. That's abuse. I'm working for $20k less than I did before the pandemic for the same work due to greedflation. That's wrong.",AllTheWine05,t2_2j2yhezc,2,0,reddit4

The reality is however that as cities become more densely populated, the amount of land does not increase typically so more people will be squeezing into each housing unit. New construction especially in cities is expensive so that usually means more people sharing older houses and apartments. So people will continue to live in that region, but will likely live a lower quality of life as a result of housing costs.

The alternative workers have is to move to a lower cost of living area and risk even lower wages. Ultimately, the only way for workers to be able to secure higher wages is specialization in something that is economically in demand. If you are one of a few people who do a thing, and people actually care about that thing and are willing to pay money to get it done, then you can secure your income and raise your wages over time.

They're the ones that are primarily responsible for not sharing the wealth with employees. It's also scaled. 


The average profit for a McD's is 150k.  Assuming the average McDs has 25 employees, they could take half of that 150k and give employees a $3000 a year raise.

Thats fine - its what people will work for.

jmap7wc,t1_jmako9x,2023-05-31 04:09:27,WorkReform,"Sure. BK employs roughly 34,000 workers. Let's say, for example, 4,000 of those workers get paid minimum wage. That varies by state.  California minimum is $15.50 per hour while Kentucky is $7.25.  

So if a fry cook with 3 months experience in Kentucky gets a $1 raise to pull him up above the poverty line why shouldn't a California fry cook get the same bump?  But not $1 because it should be based on percentage. So $2 for the California fry cooks.  Cost of living is higher in California. 4,000 workers getting $1-2 increases per hour.  To make it right, all fry cooks get an increase.

Now another Kentucky fry cook who has been there for 9 years and has racked up some annual increases gets a $1.50 an hour raise based on his current rate of $11.50.  Now he makes as much as a shift manager, and he did nothing to earn that. Didn't improve his skillset, didn't save the business money, nothing. 

So what about late shift managers?  Should they not get more money for doing the same job too?  They have bills to pay and kids to feed.  It's harder to replace those people because they have more responsibility.  Cant have them only making what the aimless fry cook for 9 years makes.

I think the first thing that happens is employers drop their wages to as low as they think they can get away with (way lower than they can actually get away with). Some employees deal with it for the short term and suffer for it, eventually they're forced to quit and these companies don't gain any new employees.

Some businesses will have the ability to wait it out and slowly raise rates over time until they start getting employees again. Others, such as new small businesses started by like 1 dude using his savings who thought he could make it work at a certain price but cant get employees at the low rate they hoped will fail pretty quick and basically just have to funnel his money to the landlord of the property they can no longer afford. End of the day, landlords win, small business fails and more people are homeless because there are either no jobs that pay enough or no jobs at all.

So in that regard, I think its just better to define a line in the first place that must be met, then only people who can afford that line in the first place will bother trying to start a business and create jobs that at least pay some minimum amount.

jmcjell,t1_jmbnbsy,2023-05-31 15:15:10,WorkReform,"Its not nit picking. The reality is that two or more part time jobs are less efficient per hour worked than one full time job simply due to travel time between jobs. Then there is the issue of breaks/lunch during the work day, vacations, holidays, and benefits. Part time jobs don't often come with those benefits, so a person working two or more jobs averages a lower take home than does one full time person.

The only way to make a part time job equivalent per hour is to raise the wage *above* the fulltime hourly equivalent, and that is something employers are not going to do of their own accord. If you mandate it through government action, it will make part time jobs less attractive to employers and some of those jobs will be eliminated (eg send your kids to an after school program rather than pay a premium for an over priced nanny).

If you want people to make more money, raise the minimum wage, expand social services to cover things like single payer healthcare, and enforce the tax laws so the rich and corporations can't get away with never paying for anything.

I'll partially concede on the economy of scale that Wal-Mart forces but I'll push back on it also, in that if they didn't solely stock cheap crap from China and push their suppliers to their absolutely breaking points just to be on their shelves, those suppliers could probably afford to pay their own people more and then those people could afford to pay a little more at the store.

I can afford to eat out, even with the prices all going up stupid amounts lately. I noticed that my lunch at the drive-thru, that used to cost me ~$11, instead cost me $16 the other day. It didn't stop me from ordering what I wanted and it won't stop me from going back.

What I notice, though, is that I have 5 fast food options within two miles of my home and that quickly goes up to a dozen and then a hundred or more in my medium-sized city. Do I need 20 McDonald's, 10 Burger Kings, 10 Carl's Jr.'s, 15 Wendy's, 4 Red Robin's, just to get a burger? 

If we paid living wages, and let the prices go where they needed to go to support that, then yeah, less people would go out to eat. People like me still would, though. And we'd need less stores, but we'd still need some. And I might have to drive three miles instead of two, but do you really care how far I go to get my overpriced burger?

I do think it's possible to be a good person in a bad industry because *life.* But it's also easy to write a narrative to paint yourself as a good person from your own perspective (the below reflects that).

**Background**

Grew up poor af (lived alone in a house without full power for the end of of senior year, worked full- time through high school and most of college, etc.). College was my way out, grad school didn't seem possible. Looked for whatever field could make me money with just a bachelor's degree. Landed in Actuarial Science.

Graduate, get a job working on ACA stuff for a huge carrier, move to a big city. Love the math, but leave my first job after a few years because I felt really grossed out at a celebration because net earnings were like $10 **billion** higher than budget one year (mostly just mad we were celebrating overcharging people).

Get a job at a much smaller, non-profit place. Mostly excited about it being non-profit, that'll fix my guilt. After a few years there it starts clicking (especially as I see more how the sausage is made), non-profit is BS and how much better we'd be without health insurance as a middle-man. Our company wasn't raking it in, mind you, but our parent company was from the other side of healthcare. Make material plans to get out (started applying to grad schools to get into biostatistics and planning my stored PTO to keep working in school).

Have a small breakdown over being transgender stuff (got unbearable staying in the closet), covid hit, and I bought a house (that part was controllable, in fairness). All those things together kind of left me in a ""I can't handle the instability of a career switch right now.""

It's a few years later, now things are settled down and that's becoming a real conversation again. My partner is in a shittier job (equally evil but less pay and worse leadership), and we likely will need to leave the state because of the whole being trans in a red state thing. Steps are being made, it's just tough and there's always excuses.

I enjoy the math. I like my coworkers personally. I also think most of us have good intentions. But I also think companies partially exist so evil can be done without individuals bearing the guilt.

If I fuck up a burger, someone *could* die. Allergies are a thing you know.

I doubt I’d keep my job at the very least and I also doubt anyone would want to hire me to cook again. The inevitable inspection might take the jobs from everyone if the place gets shut down.

Food poisoning is also no joke. It’s not usually a “haha funny puke” for an hour, it’s blowing more chunks and liquids out of both ends than should even be possible, until nothing comes out but your body won’t stop heaving, to the point where you beg for death. I’ve had it, I begged for death on my bathroom floor. And people do also die from food poisoning.

Do you know which chemicals are safe to use for each surface? How about which ones will react and turn into dangerous gases when used together or after each other? Those will damage your body at best and kill you if concentrated enough.

Pilot light went out while cleaning? Well that’s a timebomb waiting to blow. Faces will literally melt, and the building will be shrapnel spread across several blocks, it’s actually happened before. Good thing I always double and even triple check that everything is ok when I shut down the kitchen.

I may not need a degree to cook, but if I don’t do my job responsibly then a simple toothpick can kill someone if it gets ingested.

You can change the labels it doesnt change anything. Call them ""petty upper"" or ""lower upper"" if it suits you.  

> I've worked hard for my upper middle position

Unless you are a billionaire with privileged access to debt, you are lower class. 

The true upper class cannot be measured in terms of dollars, since dollars mean so little to them. 

All of us who pay retail interest are lower class, defacto. A true ""middle class"" can only exist after the fed is eliminated.

> Now I'm $1XX/hr and still have a W2.

If you have a w2 then you are surely the lowest class, no matter how high the wage is.  Kicking 100's of thousand of dollars to the IRS to spend on the real upper class feels bad, doesnt it.

Anyone at that wage level should be able to claim independence, at least becoming a 1099 if not a real business. I highly recommend it as you can drop your tax load down to a fraction of what it is as a w2. Its nice being able to earn a living without contributing to some billionaires next mega-yacht.

The worker doesn't get the short end of the stick, it's just a different end. When you open a small business you need to worry about being profitable and surviving. The owner bears the largest financial risk until the business is continually profitable. As such, they're free to run their business as they please as long as it's a safe regulated environment. In bigger companies they have a fiduciary duty to make money or they can be sued out of existence by stakeholders.

Workers have the power to just not work, and stick it to their employers. I've done this myself many times. If the employer is truly unfair then the power of the worker will see their collapse. This hasn't happened because most are willing to work these positions and desire for more money without doing the hard work (striking, unionize, higher education, etc).

jmd7toa,t1_jmd1xa6,2023-05-31 17:48:04,WorkReform,"So you are more upset that someone would live like a king because of where they are currently at. Did it ever occur that maybe they want to live somewhere else? If they are paid just enough to survive in that town, then they are trapped in that town. What about traveling to another town to get more pay? Should they be restricted to only work in their town? My town has a gas station, thats it. I have to drive 15 miles to a job. Living in a small town is objectively more expensive than living in a small city. 

If the ""free market"" chose their own wages we would be paid a quarter of what we're being paid. The current minimum wage was bought by blood, the 40hr workweek is bought by blood. Don't underestimate a corporate's greed. If they could legally pay you a dime an hour they would.

It's this selfishness of ""i don't want anyone to succeed better than me, we should all suffer equally"" that is the problem. If you don't think we should suffer equally, then why care if 31 an hour is more comfortable in another town? I would be jealous of someone making 31 an hour flipping burgers but i would also be happy for them and not want to take that away from them. 

Btw, living wage in my state is 22 an hour. We make half that and struggle to survive, if our income was doubled to 22 we may actually be able to relax and afford something luxurious.. like a trip to the lake, or food thats actually healthy, or all of our utilities and rent.

Bootcamps, 6 month programs, online certificates are all pumping people into a field with little to no experience and the promise of 100k starting salaries. 

I got lucky, did a Bachelors of Interaction Design and went full time into the company I did my internship with, starting salary was 55k USD with no stock and it was a great role. Worked there for 2 years and moved to a new role with a 75k base and an additional ~20k in RSU's. A year later I just moved into a new role with my above mentioned comp but to be honest this new role is a outlier in the comp side. I was also helped by some freelance work I took on over college which got me the internship. 

Most designers are working for 5-7 years before they break 100k and even then a lot of people from my program are still working entry to mid level design roles that pay in the 60-70s. 

Not saying it's a bad move, just want to temper expectations.  

----------------------

With that out of the way, it's a fun area to be in and I'd recommend you do more research into UX / Product Design before investing too much. 

The /r/userexperience wiki will give you a great dive into a plan for getting started in UX https://old.reddit.com//r/userexperience/wiki/index 

I'd start by watching a few videos on what product designers actually do and see if it's interesting to you. From there you can do a ton of stuff self taught and if you want to get really invested there are a number of great HCI (Human Computer Interaction) 1 year Masters Programs that will give you all the tools to succeed, provided you're able to invest more time / effort than just the bare minimum to graduate. 

The only thing I'd add would be 90% of UX / Product Design can be taught but the last 10% is a eye for visual design. I've seen people present really well thought out portfolio pieces that address all the user needs, business goals, etc.. but it just looks terrible visually and they don't see it. Nothing against them but there is a certain amount of visual design eye that just can't be taught and you'll really struggle if you can't differentiate good and bad UI.

Good advice that I got from a buddy who’s a Silicon Valley tech bro: lie on your resume. Jobs are infinite in this field, and your first goal needs to be getting calls back about your resume. Put down skills that you don’t have, talk about projects that nobody can verify, etc. 

Take the interviews, bomb them, and take notes on what they asked about. Then, actually learn the skills that got callbacks and remove the stuff that nobody asked about. It’s a good way to ensure that you have a good resume. 

You could be Steve Wozniak, but if your resume isn’t strong enough, nobody will know because they won’t call you back over it. Include as many numbers as you can, and try to make sure that anything they ask about will be impossible to verify. 

When you’re ready to apply for real for real, ensure that your resume is up to date and accurate, but until then— lie your ass off and piss off a bunch of companies while you figure out what’s in demand and how best to show that you know it.",,,2,0,reddit1

There are other things, too. Being denied loans and likewise for being in the marijuana industry. There’s truly a lot of negatives to working at a dispensary, so you’d think the upper management would pay you more and treat you better to keep you around! The dispensary I just got hired at? I wouldn’t have applied here had I known.

So with that, is it even possible to unionize in an industry that’s not federally legal?",cosmicentropie,t2_6m0r8pc8,3,0,reddit3

Started at a dispensary last November. Was having a great time, but my coworkers that had been there for years kept me at a distance. I found this weird, but wrote it off as being the FNG.

2.5 months later I’m almost done with my probation period, about to earn full employee status.

I show up for work on that fateful Monday, text my manager a question, when he responds with “hey man, you should check your email.” My stomach dropped. I found a termination email that was sent on Sunday. I was working 30mins into my morning when I found out I was fired the day prior. 

I was devastated. I though this would finally be my path to saving money, and building my life. 

Turns out the dispensary was only keeping me for seasonal work under the lie that I was working towards a permanent position like the others that worked there.",,,3,0,reddit3

hwgujzu,t1_hwehumr,2022-02-11 05:01:56,WorkReform,"2 days a month would be 24 days of sick leave per year on average. I'm not familiar with every countries' legislation, but i can't think of one who offers that many days on the top of my head.

Where i live we don't really get sick days, we just get a doctor's note when we need them and take whatever is needed (you won't get a doctor's note for something minor like a headache or something though), but aside from people with medical conditions, i don't see anyone around me being sick that often. Typically ""healthy"" people get maybe 5 sick days a year, if that.

 We get a lot more vacations though (5 weeks guaranteed, often more after a while at the same place).

I'm all for workers rights, and from what i read, working conditions, and wages vs cost of living in the US, is an horror story. It's also a different culture from my understanding, with few vacations days a year, so people may be tempted to use sick days more freely. But i don't think it's reasonable to expect the average, healthy, employee to be sick almost a month every year (covid kinda changed that tho).",lonelornfr,t2_h6l6wo,0,0,reddit3

hwjl685,t1_hwgujzu,2022-02-11 19:23:01,WorkReform,"No, I wouldn't expect the average employee to be healthy. People can be elderly, have disabilities, chronic illnesses, they get sick, their kids get sick, or anyone theyre caretaking for get sick. If you're thinking of every worker as a 20-year-old healthy, childless, young person with access to preventative care, you need to rethink what the ""average"" worker looks like.

FYI we don't have mandated vacation OR sick leave in the US, and therefore many (most?) workplaces don't offer it. So it's not really a calculus of what type of leave you're using. Personally I have never had any sick or vacation time at any job I've ever had, paid or unpaid. That means if I want to take time off, I can ask, but my boss can say no. If they say yes, I won't be getting paid for the days off. I can call in sick, and they can tell me to come in anyways. If I insist that I'm really too sick to come in, they can fire me, and that would be legal. 

OP was mildly sick and waiting on the results of a covid test, which takes 72 hours in my city. That was responsible if him not to go in. Then he called in 1 time for a migraine and got fired. This over the course of two months... this is very average, typical, predictable human health.

igarfv8,t3_vzul5x,2022-07-15 18:53:05,WorkReform,"I used to work at Microsoft WAY back in the day.

Me and two other guys started in the same department about 6 weeks apart (total), but had different managers.  We very quickly became good work friends and had friendly competitions to be the best.  This meant solving complex issues, writing KB articles, finding and submitting bugs and closing cases incredibly fast.

Between the 3 of us, we created complex virtual environments for our own use and for our teammates so they could quickly replicate customer environments to replicate customer problems and come up with solutions. 

In short, we were the balls.

Two of us were single and the other guys wife was still living out of state.  So we were at work ALL the time.  I mean, we would get there at 8 AM and sometimes stay past midnight just working and playing.  We were often there for a few hours on the weekend.

So sometimes during the day, we would either hook up a Genesis to a conference room TV or get a game of Diablo going.  Nothing insane from 8 AM - 5 PM.  But maybe 15-20 minute to blow off some steam (late night Diablo and Quake games were epic, but that is another story).

Anyway, one time my boss pulled me into a meeting to state he was concerned about me and my coworkers playing ""on company time"".   I asked him to pull up the number of cases I closed in the last month and my average closing time.  I asked him if anyone else was higher.  The answer was No.  I asked him if anyone had a higher KB article contribution rate.  The answer was No.  

I then asked him if he would prefer I request moving to a different team manager.  He definitely answered No (the same metrics I was nailing made his review look good).

I let him know that if he was ever concerned about my performance, I would be happy to move to one of the other 4 managers in our group.

He never mentioned my playing at work again.  

Don't forget that if you are performing well, it reflects well on your manager.  In fact, the higher up the chain it goes (Director, VP, Senior VP, etc) the more you kicking ass matters and the less low level management politics plays a role.",YesterShill,t2_5f8wr4,90,0,reddit4

Here is what you can do:

1. Start applying today. The hiring process can take painfully long, the best time to start was yesterday.

2. Document EVERYTHING. This includes the conversation about eating at your desk. It can read similar to ‘as per our conversation regarding eating lunch at my desk and taking my break at a different time, as I am not in violation of any company policies as of [date], and you could not provide a reason as to why I cannot do this, I will continue to do so.’ It’s important to note the date in case HR puts a policy about it in place to try to make your termination easier.

3. Please know that no one is actually thinks you have a reputation. At least not your co-workers. No one gives two hoots what time you leave at aside from HR & from the sounds of it, the micromanaging CEO. Saying you have a reputation is a scare tactic to make you uncomfortable at work (ie, make you quit).

4. If you are currently going above and beyond in any way at your job, stop immediately. I’d advise to read through your employment agreement & make sure you are completing only the tasks outlined there. If HR or your manager give you shit, you can refer them to the contract they provided you with and that the extra work would be a violation of it.

5. If they do terminate with cause, as long as you have documentation, lawyer up. I’ve processed terminations that went from a 10k payout to 30k because the employee got a lawyer to send a letter. Do not be scared of your employer, you have rights, they just don’t want you to be aware of them.

To answer your main question, the HR is being incredibly unreasonable. But know that the reason is because they are being instructed to be from some higher up somewhere. In our departments our only job is to ask ‘how high?’ when the boss says to jump.",tacolover_55,t2_m8phcg1,1,0,reddit4

First, what state do you work in?  That is relevant for most employment laws.  Second, a lot of states have specific requirements related to how long an employee can work before they are required to take a break or clock out for lunch.  However, most of these laws apply exclusively to non-salaried, exempt employees.  This kind of sounds like your company is trying to implement a comprehensive timekeeping system to make sure that employees are taking breaks and lunches at the right time.  Perhaps an uninformed manager is incorrectly applying this to salaried, non-exempt employees.  This is a dangerous thing to do for the company, as it may support a finding that you are actually NON-exempt and subject to potential overtime.    


My suggestion in most of these situations is to have reasoned, not pissed off discussions with people above your manager.  Ask for some clarity about the policies, what they are trying to achieve, and how and why these rules are applied to you.  A lot of low to middle level managers incorrectly implement timekeeping and other policies, and a lot of HR managers promulgate policies that simply don't work, or increase legal risk,  They simply don't understand what the actual policies are and how they are supposed to be applied.",Matt_the_Bro,t2_d655k,1,0,reddit4

- getting in trouble for being literal minutes late is ridiculous and that actually sounds like either incompetence or like your boss is making something up bc they have control issues. 
- I would expect you to be entitled to some sort of bereavement leave/pay. Please check if you have that having to use your PTO is astounding. 
- having to inform someone of your breaks?? No no, no no. It’s different if you’re like “imma be gone for 2 hours,” but a normal break does not need to be documented wth.
- Re: lunch: it sounds like they want you to socialize and “be part of the work culture” which is 🙄
- if you’re non exempt you are owed OT pay for clocking in early. 10 minutes is 10 minutes. So if they have not complained already about the issue (sounds like they didn’t) they should be paying you OT.

Although you arrive at the office 10min early  - stretch your legs. Do whatever. Never again clock in before 7:59am. 

At the end of the day, continue to leave at 4:00pm. Every single day.

From now on bring lunch foods that are more discreet. Snacking at your desk is fine. Eating an entire lunch is not. That is what the break is for. So, snack.

But you don't have to snack right before lunch. Have a morning snack and an afternoon snack. That way your lunch is smaller. Sometimes you can then snack while walking.

""Coworkers"" mean HR, your boss, or other managers. No one else gives a fuck. UNLESS they see you getting 'special treatment' eating at your desk and want to know why they cant.

Ask you boss specifically WHO said this is a problem. Don't expect an answer but it will help stop the nameless blame.

Whenever you see a manager, hide your snacks. It is the same as hiding the book you are reading.

igdp9ni,t3_vzul5x,2022-07-16 10:48:41,WorkReform,"First off, any HR worth their shit would have you on fmla for your father dying. Having to use pto/ take unpaid time off is where my care for their opinion would end.

My HR tries to be the same, but in practice doesn't hold up. I think they realize the shit storm that would happen if they enforced everything. Last week they were saying how they're ready to start writing people up for coming in late. In practice though, we're all late, every single one of us, each and every single day. Typically only 2-10 minutes late, and its something we'd fight over.

They also tried to change our system so we could have more clients waiting on us, and can't pass them back and forth between employees. They implemented it for a week before enough complaints were sent over. They stopped complaining about long waits as soon as we pushed back and started asking if they want to take care of certain clients.

I work with a bunch of assholes, but fuck, I love them, and I love the way they'll push back on HR and management, knowing how much money they make for the company. I've seen people in management offices fighting for better pay and training for other people. Hell, when they changed my pay plan a while back to make less money with more work, I yelled at 3 managers for probably 20 minutes, then took a vacation. Came back, and there was a $3/hr raise for those employees, instituted right after I left for a week.

People need to start standing up to this sort of tactic. HR makes no money. Zero, zip. They leech off the money other people make. Ultimately, its the people making the money deciding what they'll allow. I make my company near $45k a month, after my pay is subtracted. I work hard, I'm not going to let anyone who is a leech off me try to tell me to work harder. They know as soon as they come down, I will come down on them even harder.

This person or persons have nothing better to do than watch you and what you do. Doesn't matter that you perform your job or even outperform. This person gets high on power plays and/or is just miserable in their own life so they want to spread the misery. The best thing you can do is prepare yourself for whatever may happen or just quit. 

I've been through this same scenario at multiple jobs. There are just people who sneak their way into positions of power and find ways to make others miserable because that's all they are good at. I had a single manager do this. I've had multiple managers at the same company do this. I eat my lunch at a certain time that's a problem. I leave at a certain time that's a problem with another manager. It all got back to me via my direct manager. I got so fed up with trying to please everyone that at one point I told a then manager ""Look I'm not going to live in fear of my job anymore because someone interprets something from a few minutes observation out of an 8 hour work day.

Basically exempt employees are supposed to be traditionally salary positions like managers and white collar positions and it meant they were exempt from certain overtime requirements.

There may be individual state laws regarding salaried and hourly, but I wouldn’t know what they were state by state.

igaudzl,t1_igakm8r,2022-07-15 19:12:52,WorkReform,"i think this approach works best (although understood not everyone has this kind of flexibility):

* your only power comes from your willingness to leave. so do everything you can to make sure you can and are willing to if needed.
* come up with your personal ""bare minimum"" that you think is fair pay for fair work
   * this should be based on research into your specific role and industry - think from your employers perspective, who will they have to pay next if you leave? you should be getting paid AT LEAST as much as that person, if only because for the company keeping you is cheaper than training someone new
* negotiate in good faith - you don't have to attack them and threaten to leave, but make your case and state your goals for your position and compensation package
* come up with your personal ""red lines"" in negotiation besides just pay - if the company crosses those lines, for example negotiating in bad faith, lying, coming up with BS reasons to dock your performance that have no bearing on actual KPIs

&#x200B;

YOUR ONLY DECISION IS THIS: if (a) your bare minimum compensation is not met, or (b) a red line is crossed, you start looking for new jobs. it's that simple. you are no longer staying. you don't have to quit on the spot - you aren't crazy and aren't out to stop getting a paycheck. but your life plan is now to move on to the next job ASAP.

* Do you supervisor anyone who works different hours than you?
* Is there a reasonable expectation you may have to work outside the normal operational hours on a regular basis?
* Is your role one that only you can perform, and others cannot easily step into to cover your position during emergencies?
* Do you make over 40K?

Any of those are the basis for salary exempt.  Because if there's an emergency at 6PM on Tuesday with the person you supervise and you need to come in to help them fix it, then you need the flexibility to come in for fewer hours on Friday afternoon, and tracking it is a nightmare.

On a totally related note, I see patients every single day who are consistently in pain because of their job duties. I’m a student intern right now and I have about 12 patients I see weekly, and off the top of my head, I can think of 10 of them who have painful symptoms directly related to their work. Pain that keeps them from playing with their kids, from doing their hobbies, from doing *anything* when they get home other than try to relax and ignore the pain. You all know how hard it is to ignore low back pain or a headache. So many people, like your dad and mine, for whatever reason refuse to believe that their issues come from work. The rest who do understand can’t really do anything about it either. 

The NFL opened me up to this idea, that those athletes are risking their bodies literally for a big paycheck. A paycheck in which they absolutely are not rewarded fairly for the contribution they make to the organization’s success. I instantly thought of my father, the 67 year old scraping wild animal corpses off the highway in the dead of winter, cutting up timber in the middle of a Midwest, muggy July.

I had a lot of time to reflect.

 I never really spoke out against injustices I would see, and I promised myself self to change that and fuel my passion with that anger I had. Sadly, I believe a lot of these people who have been so brainwashed by the people in power are just incapable of complex thought or seeing beyond their own perspective. They are so easily manipulated.

The answer is not to respond to the manipulated people with anger because they are angry already. That is what works in the elites' favor. When I talk with people online, I always make sure to respond as kindly as possible. I may write something out I want to say, but I delete it. They are expecting me to react with anger.

The problem, fundamentally is that most immediate ways to combat inflation from a government perspective are detrimental to people pulling W2s the most. Raising interest rates doesn't stop the rich from borrowing or corporations, but it does stop The Poors from being able to afford houses which means they have to rent which drives up rental costs hello inflation.

Powell is saying that wage increases are good thing but they need to slow down as the wage increases are jumping higher than inflation and prices can maintain the pace. Powell wants to cool hiring because rapid wage hikes with hot inflation is a good way for us to enter hyperinflation. Powell said in the last meeting minutes that unemployment dropping to near 2% is a good thing. But the federal reserve board wants to cool bank rates to slow down spending and borrowing. He is signaling to Wallstreet and to banks that unless they chill out, the federal reserve will have to increase rates further, putting pressure on those companies to pull back on their profits. Unfortunately, what that often leads to is hiring freezes and layoffs. 

What needs to happen is to go after corporations that have hiked their ceo pay and bonuses as well as their profit margins instead of raising wages of their employees. The FED is doing what it can to keep stagflation or hyperinflation from happening. Because trust me on this, you don’t want either of those scenarios.

i8ctp0k,t3_uo1yhe,2022-05-12 19:17:07,WorkReform,"So salary doesn't increase inflation it increases cost. The definition of inflation for economics deals with the fall of purchasing power of a currency. IE: What used to take $15 to buy now takes $25 because each $1 is worth less than previously. Its a broader impact because it doesn't rely on what those in the supply chain make to cause this price rise.

A raise in wages increases the cost of getting the product to market because the people in the chain need to be paid enough to make it worth showing up to work everyday. Now this does increase the end price but its not because the currency lost value its because the product costs more to put on the shelf at the store. On top of this theres a positive feedback loop in that the workers turn around and spend the money and inject in back into the economy to circulate. The rich don't do this and they hoard the value in assets instead. 

The economy REQUIRES this ever lasting circulation of wealth because if too much gets locked off the whole system stalls and falls apart. This is the main reasoning because the ""stimulus"" argument. You give money to the poor, they spend it, this jumpstarts the economy and gets it running again. The problem is too much wealth is being contained at the top, including the stimulus, so the system is about to stall.

In the past we had ""resets"" through violent revolutions and war. Are we headed towards that? I'm not sure.

Yes, but possibly not for the reason you assume. 

Let's say for a moment you are trying to solve a time sensitive problem. There are two sides, and you could solve the problem by applying pressure to either side. 

One side has a tremendous amount of money and legal resources, and will fight you tooth and nail every step of the way, potentially dragging the issue through the courts for years and preventing you from solving the problem in time. 

The other has no power to fight you, and will be forced to roll over and take it if they wish to continue to survive. 

If you need to solve the problem and you can't wait years to fight the powerful group, your only real option is to screw over the weaker group.

>The recent spurt in inflation has little do with workers being paid more, economists say, warning the claim that wage increases could set off inflation is “over-the-top alarmism”...

>Jim Stanford, an economist and director of the Centre for Future Work, said worries that a wage-price escalation would kick off if wage increases reached 5% a year were overblown. Such increases had been “normal” in the first decade of this century, with three years of such rises, and the economy could cope with their return.

>“This over-the-top alarmism shows how much the goalposts have shifted after nine straight years of historically weak wages growth,” Stanford said. “In most countries it would be seen as desirable that wages would finally show some vitality.”...

>“They want workers to experience a continuing real wage cut because they think that’s the way to solve this inflation issue even though this inflation has nothing to do with wages,” Stanford said. “No one has argued that this inflation has been caused by domestic wages.”",lmxbftw,t2_6n7di,2,0,reddit2

The best lie capitalism told is that corporate profits should have priority over employee compensation. That's not how economics works.

Rich folks may save up billions to buy a plane, but that action benefits few people. Common folks spend on everything from food to toilet paper to new cars - the group is just more dynamic and powerful in terms of economic benefits.

The good news however, is that a monopolist capitalism is fully ripe for socialist revolution, as production is already socialized. The economic condition is met, the political condition remains: rule of the proletariat. The only possible solution forward for the problems confronting society is the abolition of capitalist rule.

> “In the trusts, freedom of competition changes into its very opposite — into monopoly; and the production without any definite plan of capitalistic society capitulates to the production upon a definite plan of the invading socialistic society. Certainly, this is so far still to the benefit and advantage of the capitalists. But, in this case, the exploitation is so palpable, that it must break down. No nation will put up with production conducted by trusts, with so barefaced an exploitation of the community by a small band of dividend-mongers.
**In any case, with trusts or without, the official representative of capitalist society — the state — will ultimately have to undertake the direction of production.** This necessity for conversion into State property is felt first in the great institutions for intercourse and communication — the post office, the telegraphs, the railways.

> **If the crises demonstrate the incapacity of the bourgeoisie for managing any longer modern productive forces, the transformation of the great establishments for production and distribution into joint-stock companies, trusts, and State property, show how unnecessary the bourgeoisie are for that purpose.** All the social functions of the capitalist has no further social function than that of pocketing dividends, tearing off coupons, and gambling on the Stock Exchange, where the different capitalists despoil one another of their capital. At first, the capitalistic mode of production forces out the workers. Now, it forces out the capitalists, and reduces them, just as it reduced the workers, to the ranks of the surplus-population, although not immediately into those of the industrial reserve army.

> **But, the transformation — either into joint-stock companies and trusts, or into State-ownership — does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces.** In the joint-stock companies and trusts, this is obvious. And the modern State, again, is only the organization that bourgeois society takes on in order to support the external conditions of the capitalist mode of production against the encroachments as well of the workers as of individual capitalists. **The modern state, no matter what its form, is essentially a capitalist machine — the state of the capitalists, the ideal personification of the total national capital. The more it proceeds to the taking over of productive forces, the more does it actually become the national capitalist, the more citizens does it exploit. The workers remain wage-workers — proletarians.** The capitalist relation is not done away with. It is, rather, brought to a head.”",Scientific_Socialist,t2_3mt3pdta,6,0,reddit2

i8dn293,t1_i8dcwkj,2022-05-12 22:35:13,WorkReform,"First off, I have no background in macroeconomics outside of the class I took en route to a biology degree. 

There's a semi popular animation called Money As Debt and while it has a few problems,  it contains a good way to think about inflation.  Imagine money doesn't exist. Then, a guy decides to start a bank and introduces money. His first customer comes in and takes out a loan of $100 at 10% interest. In this scenario,  $100 is all the money in existence,  so how can he pay the loan back with interest? The answer is that he doesn't,  but by in effect loaning more money than exists, they've created wealth in the form of debt. 

So the fed controls interest rates to try to keep annual inflation to around 2% per year.

Now, things like bailouts and tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations are basically 'creating' more money, but it's money that will basically exist on paper. A trillion dollar tax cut to them doesn't mean a trillion more dollars will be in circulation.  

If we passed a similar trillon dollar tax cut/give away to the bottom poorest half of the US, the people who struggle to pay bills, that trillion dollars would be in circulation in a few hours.

During the pandemic,  we gave money to a lot of people fairly indiscriminately.  It introduced a lot of money into the economy but to a large degree people couldn't buy everything they wanted to. Crude oil had negative value because it had negative demand. People took the opportunity to find better jobs, get some training, increase their (at least perceived) worth. As things spun back up, demand was far higher for many items than supply. People have cash and desires but supply isn't there. So now in the supply vs. demand world, the supply of money is high and demand for it is down compared to goods. Therefore,  money is worth a bit less than it was. 

So how do you turn it around? I have no idea and don't think anyone really does.",robywar,t2_1qir,3,0,reddit2

kdc0wer,t3_18hzvhl,2023-12-14 15:54:04,WorkReform,"My daughter started working here recently, and I am finding out what shit heads they really are to their employees. 

She got a stain on her yellow safety belt, and they made her buy a new one.

They gave her her first uniforms, which didn't fit right because they were not able to try them on before ordering. When they didn't fit, they told her she needed to buy her own if she wanted more.

I read a reminder message that was sent to all employees that if they took counterfeit cash, the employee had to pay it back. This is not even legal. They can discipline, but making the employee pay is not legal.

The very worst part is that they give this illusion of being a wholesome organization. They don't give a damn that my daughter is a senior and high school and has to get up at 6am. They hold these kids until 10 or 10:30 at night to close. At this point, she only keeps the job because it will be good for a resume.

I used to work in this industry and know what the blanks cost approx and what we sold them to our customers for. The ""discount"" is probably because the restaurant is anticipating a bulk order for this buy, which lowers the overall cost. The regular price is most likely the one off price, when you buy things one at a time. Setting up an embroidery machine, silkscreen press, or even a heat transfer takes time and it's fairly expensive if you're doing 1-2 of them at a time.

To be clear, it's still bullshit to pass the costs on to the employees. Better to just buy one for every current employee and then have a stack in the backroom to give out with the rest of the uniform for new employees.

And on top of all the free stuff, you still had the option to wear whatever you wanted for outerwear as long as it was clean and you didn't bring it home every day.

I seriously hate American management sometimes because this obsessive cost-cutting (part of Creative Accounting) is trashing the job market and is a drag on GDP.

Don't let dipshit managers get away with forcing you to pay for company apparel.

Should nurses on call not receive on call payment for being at home but ready to go into work at a moments notice? Should doctors who are scheduled 24hr shifts not be paid just because they are given windows of time to sleep?

ir5o7tj,t3_xvkp4s,2022-10-05 14:59:14,WorkReform,"In the US, unless there is an employment contract in place that provides otherwise, and unless you are legally considered a professional or management position (that is not just a name, - an asst. manager who is really just a regular worker does not qualify) then overtime is required for all other position.  But -- overtime is determined by weekly hours rather than daily hours.  Again, unless the business has a more generous policy. 

It is fine, for example, to pay a worker overtime for every hour worked more than 8 in a given day, even if they only work 40 hours for the week.  And, I believe the overtime is calculated on a pay period basis but not more than 2 weeks.  So, if paid weekly then overtime is determined weekly.  If paid every other week then it is determined on a 2 week basis.  So, for example, if you worked 2 extra hours say to help clean up one night, and then were told to sleep in and come in 2 hours later -- your total hours for the week are not going to change.  No overtime for those 2 extra hours.",cargdad,t2_iodp1,0,0,reddit4

One of our best (actually, best) salesmen was not moved up because although he was good at sales, he is a rule-bender and has no patience for the tedium that management entails. The only thing he could see is the money being better, not that he would be miserable in that position. That’s a rarity, but it happens.

You are contributing to a narrative that is just flat out wrong. Amazon would literally be up that companies ass, 4 am fuck outta here.

When I was hired, it was to be the new GM of the store. Old GM was retiring.so, for the first week, I was to work on the line, every position to learn the store. Keep in mind, I was poached from a chef de partie position at a high end local restaurant. It was an apprenticeship that was low paid, but very much good for my career at the time. I needed money and this job paid a lot more.

That lasted 3 months.

The GM kept refusing to train me in manager duties. He said that he didn't need to train me. He would be retiring in 2 months (always shifted) and that the Regional would train me then. It was at this point I started to get all of the praise in the world.

I called the Regional several times until he told me one day while I was at work, ""You are no longer qualified for the promotion.""

I replied, ""Nope. Not a promotion. You hired me for that position. [Redacted] was explicitly informed, by you in writing, that he was supposed to be training me directly after the first week.""

""Well, you aren't in a position to make demands.""

""Try me.""

Walked out with the working staff. It was the core team, all of the ""full timers"". Even the long term employees liked my leadership and this happened in the kitchen, out in the open. They lost their entire core staff that day.

The store could barely last another week. They shut down by the end of that month.

The Regional attempted to sue me twice through the franchisee, first for ""disrupting operations"", second for ""emotional damage"".

Because of the pandemic and inflation, costs are skyrocketing everywhere so wages have been going up as well. Every single facility in our network was able to make large increases to wages for this set of workers except my facility because the union comes in the middle and their contract actually strangleholds them into their set wages. This cannot be bargained against until the next open bargaining period set by the union and the facility. 

We have now lost workers, can't hire new workers, and the ones who stayed get paid less than their counterparts elsewhere. The facility wants to raise wages and make the positions competitive again.

Strong unions are not built on the backs of ( for lack of a better term) fair weather fans.

ibbbui5,t3_v5fhwn,2022-06-06 00:50:40,WorkReform,"Any logic about why unions are bad can literally also be applied to non-union jobs. One of the most common ones I hear is 'Unions protect bad workers' OK? I have only worked non-union and let me tell you, bad workers are still protected. Jim is friends with the manager? He gets to fuck off on all the team projects BUT if he decides to 'lead one' he ends up getting a lot of praise and financially rewarded for such at raise time. Jenny is sleeping with the manager? Oh she never has to do anything now. Another one I hear is 'well they take X amount of my wages'. OK, but they give you protection and the ability to fight for better wages, benefits, etc. I can guarantee you the standard (3%) wages deducted for unions is made up for in the benefits you gain. Heck, your pay alone will increase more than 3%.


With this said, this is my genuine response to anyone anti-union or worried about unions, if you hate the current state of your job for ANY reason (wages, favoritism, etc) then what do you stand to lose from unionizing? Absolute worst case, you end up in the same scenario you are currently in. Best case, and the most common scenario, you end up much better off. Also, P.S. if you are someone who ends up not gaining any ground after your workplace unionizes, you are still doing a good deed. Your unionization is strengthening others who are also part of that union. Like let's say you join the UAW, then you are strengthening EVERYONE in the UAW. So, even if your scenario didn't improve, you are still more than likely benefiting someone at a different job.

If you think the service at a restaurant is bad, go to a different restaurant! Doesn’t matter how much you like the food. 

And if you think your job is treating you unfairly, regardless of how much you like the work itself, go get a different job :)

This mentality plagues everything. The “only” way to get change to happen is to just not partake in anything that has flaws, because then surely the company responsible for it will market adjust and make improvements.

At the highest level, the union is still going to be fighting for their workers because thats the only way it stays politically and financially viable. At the local level, a bad union rep can make the experience more unpleasant, but it doesnt impact your contract. 

Ultimately, every human organization has humans in it. Which means inherently, most organizations are deeply flawed. But that doesnt mean they cant have more utility, or that they arent more efficient than another organization. 

Ive never understood the sentiment that a bad union is worse than a bad company, because the bad union still has more bargaining power and legalese to improve working conditions.

I think people work union jobs and then blame the union for problems there. Bad workers not getting fired? Unions fault. Someone not pulling their weight? Unions fault. Inflation crushing your wages? Unions fault. But these issues exist at every company, its just the reality of the modern workforce.

Also, *just one ""no"" vote per crew would veto the whole thing.* I've never heard of that in my life, but it made sense when the union had their own ""vote no"" propaganda leading up to the vote. Straight from the county manager's mouth. My crew and another voted unanimously ""yes."" Guess what? That was in March, I left in May, and they still aren't on a four day work week.

I gave myself an $18/hr raise, company vehicle, and a company gas card. All because the union and HR all but dared me to leave. I wasn't even looking until they flat out disrespected my entire shop.

In the free market, you can ask for changes *before* deciding to leave.  And sometimes you can decide to continue using the product or service if the *perceived* positives outweigh the *perceived* negatives and/or the the company actively tries to rectify the perceived negatives.  (I’m using “perceived” because what one customer perceives as a positive, another customer can perceive as a negative.)

1999, i was an IT guy in Chicago.  I was tasked with setting up our computers and machines for a trade show at the Rosemont Convention Center.  
After backing in the truck to the loading dock to start unloading and setting up my bosses booth i was screamed at by a bunch of dudes sitting by the wall smoking cigarettes.  ""You cant unload that! Thats our job!"" Im like ok, but i need to get some where by 7 tonight so i need this stuff unloaded and taken to our space.  ""We'll get to it when we get to it"".  No, you dont understand, once the stuff is there at the booth, i then need to set it all up and it's gonna take me a few hours, so i need it there now, and if you wont do it I will.  

I almost got my ass kicked for saying that.  Several dudes stood up and were talking all kinds of shit, i roll my eyes and walk away. 

Literally a bunch of low life losers whos sole job it was to take objects from loading dock to booths wanted to do it on their time and knew that if i and others did it ourselves theyd be out of a job.   

Ive since stopped working in union places.  The jobs are ALWAYS more expensive, ALWAYS LATE, ALWAYS OVER BUDGET.   And what a bunch of crybabies rhey are anyway.  We think nothing of working 10, 20 hour shifts.  Union guy gives you 8, but only about 4 of solid work.  So tou pay them more uet get less.  What really funny is they're total proud of it. Local ibew 868, local whatever we got jackets! 

So guess what we business owners do... We decide we dont do work in union areas.  So who loses here?

 Hint its not me or the business owners.

 Its the consumer who loses and as a result has to pay more for union made products and services because union workers are extremely overpaid and under skilled.

The large aerospace company that my wife used to work for not only had union employees, but it also had diversity goals that she was required to follow. Her team had employees that were complete nightmares to work with, but those employees were so protected by the union and diversity goals that she could not get rid of them. She was forced to build a racially diverse team instead of building a high output team that was built based off performance. She even managed through layoffs, in which managers were directed to follow the diversity goals when choosing who to layoff. She was forced to fire good performers so that the company could remain diverse. They would layoff certain races, but for other races they would prioritize attempting to keep them onboard but move them to a new area instead of letting them go. She would have employees sent her team (and vice versa) that she knew were already poor performers, but the company wanted to keep them to improve their diversity reporting. Needless to say the company stock price has dropped by 2/3 in the last 3 years. The highest performing companies I’ve worked for are the new tech companies which have no unions, no racial biases, etc. They’re built entirely around figuring out how to gain top level performers instead of building an environment that shelters and protects poor performers.",Extreme-Range-3137,t2_anklhapo,0,0,reddit1

Students held in classrooms that repelled out was Cranston East, at West the teachers attempted to form a human chain to prevent students from leaving which they charged and physically broke through.

Dispute was because the head of the teachers union was also head of the school board and had over run budget for years. New mayor ordered them to stay within budget and refused to sign off on over spending. The union head/school chair decided that the only way to do that was to immediately terminate all school sports and extracurricular activities.

Students organized a walkout and protest, teachers decided to try and stop them. Absolute mayhem ensued, East locked down the school and refused to allow parents to pick up their kids, West is an open campus, teachers tried to block main doors with human chain. Students shut down the roads in front of city hall. Mayor came out and told the students to address their complaints to head of school board in adjacent building, students stormed the building and many had to be dragged out after building was locked down by security.",enutz777,t2_5fctaacs,2,0,reddit1

In other words, while obviously theres an issue in that situation, its not a failing of the union. Its a failing of the school boards structure. 

I dont disagree that there are crappy people in unions who abuse their power. What i disagree with is the idea that this is exclusive to unions, and isnt just part of human organizational behavior.

Anyways, the over arching point is that when all levels of government and society are basically controlled by unions power gets abused. The teachers had organized with the school board to try and prevent the walk out because it would be detrimental to their bargaining position(that backfired).

The mayor who forced the school department to stay on budget was Steve Laffey, you would likely hate the dude because he was kind of the forerunner of the Trump style, but not corrupt (as far as I know). 

He got elected as a Republican in a like 90% dem city because the city had the worst bond rating in the entire country despite a rather high per capita income because of the union contracts. He took on the police, fire, teachers and public works unions and in 4 years had the city at an investment grade rating, one of the fastest turnarounds in history (think it was number 1 at the time but since eclipsed).

He decided to run for federal office. The Republican he faced in the primary literally inherited office from his father. Laffey received more votes than any previous Republican in a primary in the history of the state, more than the combined total votes cast in the previous primary and lost. How? The unions organized having their members disavow their democratic registrations and register as republicans (an issue with same day registration).

I absolutely am in favor of workers right to organize when they feel abused or taken advantage of. I just distrust large, especially international unions. Card check absolutely encourages intimidation. Public sector unions, like police unions, encourage government corruption and covering up under the guise of advancing the union with disregard of any and all outside of the union.
