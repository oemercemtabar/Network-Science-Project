fjl2qb8,t3_fduess,2020-03-05 20:06:27,MensRights,"Hate to say this but this chart is a bit misleading, and the title is inaccurate. (using 2019 data below, but shouldnt be too different)

Bottom line: hours worked only explains part of the wage gap. The difference between ""all income"" earned between men and women isn't 56 to 44 as the title suggests.

~~The full time labor force in the USA is 56% male and that is what the number on the chart is representing. That number does NOT account for differences in average hours worked.~~ The fact that men worked 56% of total hours does not account for the fact that there are more men in the work force, and that number includes all workers, not just full time workers.

The difference in hours worked among full time workers is 43.5 hours for full time working men vs 41.1 hours for full time working women. As a ratio this is 51.4% hours worked by the average full time male employee vs the average full time female employee. Full time working men work about 6% more than full time working women (your title suggests more like 27% more)

Among ALL (non agriculteral) workers men work on average 41 hours per week and women work on average 36.6 hours. This number is heavily skewed because of the large percentage of women who work part time. According to the BLS 20M women worked part time compared to 13M men. However, the ""wage gap"" only compares full time workers so these are not the correct hours to compare.

Simply put, you cannot explain away the wage gap with only hours worked, although it is certainly a factor. For a more detailed breakdown of some of the main factors that go into the wage gap here is a write up I did: [http://rollfordamage.net/index.php/2018/04/10/a-guide-to-equal-pay-day/](http://rollfordamage.net/index.php/2018/04/10/a-guide-to-equal-pay-day/)

Seriously. If you could pay women less to do the same work, men would be replaced with women. Its basic economics. The reality is men work longer hours, have fewer gaps in employment, negotiate more aggressively for salary and gravitate towards different competencies than women. All of those things are variables that the wage gap myth doesn't bother to control for and every one is a personal choice.

Also no one went around using their ""power"" to force anyone to hire a male plumber or engineer. It's not discrimination that men and women make personal choices to develop different competencies and its gor sure not discrimination to employ a workforce that is 60% male from a population of applicants that is also 60% male.

If you look at union jobs, they pay everyone exactly the same. But most union jobs are hourly, and women end up working less and therefore making less.

The earnings gap for union work is exactly the same as non-union work though.

You can blame this on child care to an extent but lots of times this is actually the mother's choice; she prefers that her husband works extra (and/or pays child support) so she can stay home and ~~watch Jerry Springer~~ ""take care of the kids"".

Before having kids women usually work fewer hours than men.  Which is fine. It would just be nice if a) people were honest about this, and b) men were allowed to do the same thing without being punished for it.

fjme07j,t1_fjmcio1,2020-03-06 04:13:54,MensRights,"the ""CFOI methodology"" that you're using is not some accepted standard and honestly i didnt understand what you were doing until just now. You're using statistics that include a different number of men and women, and driving them down to a number that really should be average per man or per women. It's extermely misleading.

The problem is the wage gap is the average for women and average for men. Women on average earn 77c for every dollar a man earns. Your numbers are aggregate (and not even true). You're saying women in aggregate earn 77c per every dollar that men in aggregate earn, but you're also not factoring in that men's hours are paid at a higher rate.

You're not understanding why your methodology is terrible. Let me give you an example. 

Let's say there are 10 men and 5 women in the labor force. Let's say the men work 40 hours a week and each are paid $100/hr. The women work 40 hrs/week and each are paid $50/hr. 

The wage gap is the average that women earn 50c for every $1 a man earns. 

Ok but lets use the lauded ""CFOI methodology""

Well the men work a total of 400 hrs per week and the women work a total of 200 hrs per week. NEVERMIND THAT THERE ARE A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF MEN AND WOMEN

therefore the wage gap IS PREDICTED TO BE 50c per $1! dont even bother thinking about the fact that this data is comparing an average to an aggregate!

The data happens to match 77 hrs worked per 100 hrs worked by women in aggregate vs men in aggregate, but that's just coincidence and is an awful predictor of earnings of an average woman vs an average man.

The charts are also cut to show a more dramatic effect by not showing the graph at zero. It's a trick that people use to portray data in a certain tone that fits an agenda. See this chart:

>'The decline in the number of white male teachers is concerning in areas where there is a prevalence of under-performing white working-class boys.'

This quote by the researcher is also very strange. Does he really think that minority men cannot teach or be role models to working-class white British boys? Can men only become role models to boys of the same race?

What I will say is concerning however is the dramatic drop of male teachers in general as the drop of white male teachers of 12,800 still far exceeds the increase of minority male teachers of 3,516. So that part is important.

But the problematic graphs, the strange quote and the lack of disclosing full numbers really makes me feel fishy about articles coming from this website.

Little boys face years of biased marking against them, can do well on tests but still do poorly in a class, and this is the crisis in education.

Now it could be a whole range of things, but personally I think it really has something to do with the fact there was literally no men around as I grew up, I mean my mates dads would occasionally take us to the park, one time we built a go kart, but those events I can count on a single hand.",JasePearson,t2_jdtu9,41,0,reddit3

In answer to your response, its not helpful for this issue of discrimination against men in teaching positions to point out personal experiences that include a small sampling when there is a clear and verifiable issue of widespread discrimination.

I think the most apt comparison would be the discrimination against homosexuals that was investigated years ago in the Boy Scouts of America. What they did was call up Boy Scout troop leaders around the country and have a conversation with them about their homosexual child joining. The vast majority of those they spoke with told them that their child would not be welcome in that troop. It was an overwhelmingly negative response.

That doesn't mean it was universally negative though, their study pointed out that several troop leaders were very encouraging and helpful. Stating they would be happy to welcome their homosexual child into the group. Nothing is ever absolute in terms of social issues like this. There will always be pockets or communities that somehow avoid the discrimination and have a positive and welcoming environment.

But that doesn't mean that the discrimination isn't very real and a very serious issue that the vast majority of individuals have to deal with.

Thing is, everyone I've spoken to who has worked in China for longer than a year has the same story to tell. The cost of living is cheap, the transport system is great, but you dare not say anything bad about their culture no matter how true it is, and there's only so much China you can take before you need a break.

The stereotypes about their driving are true. They're so racist they don't see it as a problem. They believe China is greater than what it is (biased news media definitely helps here).

Guess what. I'm none of that. And I'm ""white"". Never lived in a house, mother never made over $40k a year and she even got an associates degree in the early 2000s. 

Fast forward to my adult life, I ended up on the floor of my then gf who I impregnated and moved in the day my child was born, I slept on the floor in a 6'x6' space which housed all my allowed space including storage for clothes, a spot to sleep, and a desk for school. I had no job, was a senior in HS dropped out after a month into classes and worked shit jobs. I started from the bottom. I made choices that negatively influenced my starting point. But now? I make more money than BOTH my parents, I finally have my own place after fighting for 8 years. I've been in two long term relationships, the first one from age 14-21 (7 whole years) and the current one from age 22-26 (current, 4 years). I have my own business, I own a $35k truck, I go to college (which BTW I don't get fancy grants n shit cuz there's so much out there for non whites) part time, I work full time. You have to learn to invest in yourself. People are the problem, not their environment. You cannot do the same thing as other people and expect a different result. Einstein calls that insanity, I call it stupidity. 

The funny thing is that ""white privilege"" y'all complain about is that ""1%"" its not a majority of white people at all. If you were in the workforce above entry level and tried to land a career you would find not only being white but a white male is less favorable because dIvErSiTy! You cannot give favoritism to one group and not the other, that's inequality. I showed you PROOF whites die more often in the last 4 years than blacks, our average in a year was y'alls WORST year which happened ONCE. When you hear the term trailer trash you know what I think of? White people. Then Mexicans. Never blacks. When someone mentioned the ghetto its automatically black. When you mention gated communities its always whites. 

I haven't personally experienced white privilege, and I'm 26 and I live in a freaking liberal state where its all about being progressive, BLM, hire minorities, women are victims and not independent but are independent at the same time, the land of tens of thousands of educated young people who have a high unemployment rate both pre and post COVID. 

Do you ever ask yourself why the grass is greener on the other side? I came up with an answer by the time I was 20. 

""It's greener on the other side because it's fertilized with bullshit"" meaning it might look pretty but it's not real. It's astro-turf. Wanna talk about how many athletes are white? They make BANK. The ""white sports"" are hockey, baseball and NASCAR. Yet blacks are playing where the money is at, football and basketball. Predominantly black. By a long shot. Did you know there's companies that exist that hire only women or only black people, its illegal yet its allowed. 

At least when it comes to black people a first racist thought isn't ""i wonder if they're legal"" in reference to Mexicans and people with a Spanish background. Would you rather fear deportation or being accused of a crime when being in the wrong place? For my job, I go to residential areas. You bet your ass the shittiest jankiest places are communities of Mexicans and white trailer trash. Black people are a rarity in my experience in those situations. Black people are associated with gangs, cop killers. Organizing large groups with intent to threaten not only innocent people but government employees is NOT smart. It's fucking stupid. Straight up. More poor choices. 

Now, there are two types of black people. There's ni**as and ni**ers. One is respectable, gets a good job, raises a family and DOESN'T LEAVE, buys a decent car and contributes to society. The other? The mentioned gangbangin criminal. Take your pick. You can ALWAYS change your path. Especially if you haven't gotten involved in criminal activities yet. Not all black people are bad, but you're on the notion ALL white people are bad. You're like a trump hater, orange man bad. At least you're consistent and SO fixated on getting white people to say what YOU want them to say. Don't you think that comes across a little OPPRESSIVE?!",,,4,0,reddit3

That's demonstrably untrue. The anti-women part is completely untrue and the non-white racism part is greatly overstated. The fact that feminism is anti white male is demonstrably true. 

I wasn't advocating mensrights being pro-white, I was explaining why there will inevitably be some overlap of pro-white guys being pro mensrights, and vice versa, when feminism is so anti-white. A lot of male issues are more pronounced in minority communities. 

I'm tired of hearing about race. It's such a marginal issue that you can't even do anything about in terms of policy, yet it occupies so much time and attention. Especially in the US and increasingly here in the UK, thanks to changing demographics. One major reason the US is so fucked is because it's prioritised race over class, it's why it doesn't have a worker's party or basic shit like healthcare and worker's rights.

Not exactly palatable, or really even a good reason not to hire someone. I agree, ""good engineers"" is more important than ""women engineers"". 

But let's flip this into something that may help visualize. I'm assuming the risk you are concerned about is that your relationship with a young female engineer could be misconstrued as non-professional and she could accuse you of something that costs you your job. I will also assume that, in that situation, you would be the victim of a horrible misunderstanding. It's a bit catastrophizing to assume that it would cost you your career, HR isn't going to side with a woman just because woman. 

But onto the converse of my point: if a woman is statistically more likely to create an issue by raising an allegation, you could look at the reverse and say that men present a statistically higher chance of getting upset and initiating a physical altercation. This is a risk that does not present itself nearly as largely in female candidates (though they are still capable, no doubt) that is a statistically larger risk in male candidates. 

To me, these risks are both so incredibly low that they can be disregarded entirely when it comes to considering if an engineer should be trained or hired.

They have no interest in “freely competing against each other.” They just coordinate and price fix, and without governments breaking them up it always ends up being a big fish cartel situation.  Particularly in the US where these cartels are able to purchase the agency of the people regulating them.

>more cost effective services than government monopolies. 

Nope.  Every other public healthcare system in the world operates at cost.  The US system operates on top of the cost-inflated insurance system.  Corporations force you to spend twice as much tax dollars than everywhere else to cover 1/3rd as many people.  And then you have to spend hundreds of thousands of your own money on top of that.  

>The more government is involved in regulating industries, the worse those industries perform. 

Nope.  You live in one of the least regulated economies in the world and private corporations need to be bailed out at the first sign of a problem.  

>It is a nice illusion to believe that governments will control industries to the benefit of the public; 

Works overwhelmingly better in every first world country compared to the corporatist oligarchy of the US.  You just choose to pretend that letting corporations and foreigners buy elections is normal everywhere because it’s legal in the US.

>in practice those industries always end up controlling the regulations -

This is called agency capture.  You’re just a bootlicker that has been conditioned to think it’s normal because you support the people protecting it here.

>to their own benefit at the expense of everyone else. 

You’re likely going to die in medical debt lmao.  Only country in the world where that happens.

Listen mate white privelege is definetly a thing, in music too especially when you look at the 50's. Yet fun fact Elvis lived in a trailer park in a poor part of America where he lived among black people and he had nothing against black people. If you want to see an interesting video on it watch white privelege in music by Adam Neely.

There definetly was a lot of racism going on in the 50's. R&b being called ""nigger music"" or ""devils music"" just because black people often made it. That's bullshit man, music is music wether you like the music or not. It was often the parents thinking this but the younger generation of teens broke this. Elvis actually did quite a lot to help fight racism because his music sounded both black and white. He was a huge r&b and gospel fan. Sadly there were dicks and there will always be dicks. 

Don't judge a group of people by the dicks in them. If I would do that all black peoe would be gangsters, all white people would be crackheads and junkies, the asians would be totalitarian cunts and all middle eastern people would be terrorists.

People often say white people wearing hijabs, those african necklaces and north african robes is cultural appropriation so it is not a bad example.

Hate post malone, but still he's not racist for just making music he thinks is fun to make even if he started out making folk songs(his songs are still shit agreeing with you on that one). Hiphop is created by black people and I think black voices often sound better on hiphop, but it is not like black people own hiphop and white people need permission to make it, that would actually be quite racist and hypocritical.

I hate braids and baggy clothing personally, but it is people's damn right to do so wether they're white or black.

Frankly it often comes across to me that people think well we have/had bad things happen to us now you need to experience racism and hate. That just fuels the whole race war. The fun thing is that yes black lives matter definetly and yes there's definetly racism going on. But fighting by saying no you can not say that, do that, wear that, make that, have that is just going to fuel hate. Definetly in such extreme countries like America where there is a lot of racism going on.

Frankly if I were to make hiphop and someone would call me a racist I wouldn't give a fuck, but there are people who do and those are going to become more and more racist.

And? It's not like they make that up like patriarchy or something. They maybe could miss the point that it's not all white man (like poor one have no more privilege than a random woman) or about the fact that they magically don't apply to women (white women are not privileged lol) but it's not completely made up. 

>They don't toss around the phrase ""straight white male"" and exclude non-whites from all their attacks on maleness.

True sometimes but they still mostly keep the same standards for non white man, they just consider themselves as oppressed as them, which is laughable 

>They don't support BLM-- which takes a civil rights issue and a male issue and turns it into a race one, the bias against men before the law is 6 times the bias against blacks

Eh. It can both a race and male issue at the same time and the BLM movement it's pretty much the only movement that has a chance of at least improving a bit the situation which it's better than nothing. It's not perfect (well no movement is), but it's something

>Feminists will happily ally with non-white men. They view white men as the enemy.

Nah don't exaggerate. Most feminist just see man as involuntary oppressors and want equality (they genuinely believe they are fighting for equality, which is again laughable considering most of the thing they fight for now). You are talking about a radical minority, which is bad but not that big.

Assuming everyone uses the toilet for number one and number two at a rate of 70% and 30%, respectively, by everyone leaving it the way they used it, men already do more work than women! This is also assuming putting it up and putting it down is equal amounts of work.

This, though, I am completely fine with, because what the fuck. At times I find myself reaching for the seat when it's already up and I have a moment of ""holy shit this is a thing I do all the time,"" because it's such a motor reflex to move the seat at this point. How often do you hear people complaining that they need to remove their pants? However, by asking men to always put it back down you're shifting the already discriminating male work load to a workload of ""2"" in 7/10 visits, while the female workload is reduced to 0 for all visits, which makes no sense.

This I have not done the maths on, though, but I assume everyone leaving it as they used it is the best distribution of work possible, while everyone putting it down is the most biased one possible. This would probably need to be graphed, though, also with respect to different rates of pissing (I have no idea how accurate 70/30 is).",WhipIash,t2_7egwu,38,0,reddit4

If all men suddenly *chose* to sit down, yes, but that's even more hypothetical than the question. It's downright absurd to think all men would suddenly get that thought - hence what you're asking is for men to accommodate you/women.

>More hygienic

Very, very slightly more hygienic. Arses don't tend to be the cleanest of body parts, and they still have to touch the seats. Urine is sterile in the bladder, and is only added bacteria from the urethra, so in terms of hygiene it doesn't really matter much - toilet seats are not dinner plates, no matter what.

Exactly. So how does your suggestion in any way relate to the question of why men should put down the seat for women, while women shouldn't put it up? That's what I don't get.

>it's about order, or tidiness

No it isn't. Now you're referring to the *lid* of the toilet, and that's not what's being discussed *at all* - it's the seat.

Some people's natural instinct is to analyze the situation to see how and why it happened. Well, if you find something that the girl did/didn't do and point it out, it can be taken as victim blaming. 

For example, victim blaming: If you had locked your car, your laptop wouldn't have been stolen. It implies it is the victims fault that someone committed a crime against them because they didn't take precautionary measures. That it is their fault for ____ bad thing. 

This is often conflated by various people with the following;

One of the ways to prevent this from happening again is to take steps to prevent car break ins. Lock your car and don't leave anything of value in it. 

Which isn't victim blaming. Its advice for how you can prevent future thefts. The feminist narrative is that women shouldn't have to take precautions to prevent rape. Which simply isn't realistic in todays society. It is never the victims fault for a crime or bad thing happening to them, however, it is their responsibility to ensure their own safety. This is true for everyone about every type of crime.

People in the developed world seem to have a fanatical obsession with avoiding bacteria at all costs. What they completely don't understand is that they NEED to be exposed to harmful bacteria on a regular basis or the risk of getting seriously ill increases. That doesn't mean pouring vials of anthrax down their throats or anything but it does mean that avoiding all germs at all costs is actually UNHEALTHY. Like muscles that don't get exercised , if your immune system doesn't adapt to what are otherwise fairly innocuous bacteria , eventually it can't fight the newest strains.

Whatever germs are present in the average toilet bowl are NOT going to affect anybody provided they aren't licking the damned thing. Even compromised immune systems are safe from whatever is floating around the water line. As long as it isn't typhoid or cholera etc. , there's virtually nothing to fear. Further , the fact is that that toilet seat isn't exactly a vacuum-sealed unit. If it's floating in the air , putting the seat down won't do much to stop if from floating further afield. Besides that , your main point of exposure is going to be from sitting on the seat and touching the handle as well as the the toilet paper roll itself. 

TL;DR -

1)Don't be so paranoid , people.

2)You NEED to be exposed to bacteria or it BECOMES dangerous.

3)Putting the lid down won't do a damned thing to stop the bacteria anyway.

Well, this would be the case if we were talking about what guys traditionally think ""rape"" is defined as.  However, with some women referring to sex they later regret as ""rape"", this gets completely muddled.  

I once made the mistake of talking to a ""rape"" victim who regretted sex she had.  She goes into a story about dressing up in her super flirty outfit, flirting with a guy, touching him, kissing, rubbing her hands on his crotch, taking him back to her place, undressing to tease him, ripping his shirt off and rubbing him, giving him oral, letting him do the same, rubbing his privates on hers and then ""regrettingly letting him violate her insides for the next 4 hours"" with his penis and then again in the morning when she woke him up with more oral.  At no point did she make any signal or communication that she didn't want to do that.  In fact, it seems perfectly reasonable to assume she wanted to have sex, given all of the earlier activity.  But, she somehow remembered her husband at the last moment and didn't want to go any further, but she did anyway.

The slightest suggestion that she alter her previous behavior in any way was met with aggressive ""victim blaming"" rhetoric.

I just don't know how to even talk about this now.  My brain tells me to not let her get away with calling herself a rape victim, but I fear feminists will consider me a misogynist.  I wish I could help someone not be in a negative situation, but any attempt to suggest different behavior is met with hostility.

See, here's the thing. We do take precautions. Obviously we do, since we live in a society which defends rapists and, however much you like to think that everyone knows rape is wrong, rapists are led to believe, by groups like this one, that it's absolutely fine.

What we don't do if follow the typical MRA advice of ""sluts should dress right!"" (Which I do not pretend is a direct quote from your statement, but is not a strawman of the typical response.) Because, hey, what you wear doesn't actually make a difference to whether you get raped. What does make a difference is being alone, which you can't exactly defend against without chaperones... hey, maybe we could have rape-prevention bodyguards covered by healthcare insurance?

The advice given is not ""sluts should dress right"" and that is a complete mischaracterisation of the argument being put forward. The advice given is that there is a set of reasonable steps that anyone can take in order to prevent a crime; these steps differ from crime to crime. In some situations what you wear DOES make a difference.

We're not demanding that you cover up and don't wear what you like. But just acknowledge that sometimes it does draw undue attention, and in order to protect yourself from that, you MAY want to re-consider.

Ultimately it's your own decision.

I also see the flipside, and I'm sure women far out number men in false rape claims. Certain women are very much aware of the fact that society sides with them heavily and they abuse it.

Women are bullies by reputation destruction. This is a highly robust and validated fact. Women arent angels. They're people. And people like to bully. When bullying is rewarded by the desired outcome, or at least not punsihed, it will happen again, and get worse. Its like when people look at a little bit of porn and then go deeper and deeper. And Im not arguing pro/con porn, just how it works for a lot of people.

If we had a system that was ""wise"", we'd probably have a system that seems monstrously unfair, like solomon cutting a baby in half. A system devised wherein any accuser is believed, but has to take 1/10th of the punishment of the acccused at conviction, might entirely eradicate false accusations.

It might even eradicate frivolous true accusations, the kind where the boy tries to kiss the girl on a date, he makes contact, she pulls away, and then calls the campus police for his sexual assault later on. He was supposed to make a move. She's punishing him for not being attractive enough.

if she receives a slight injury for it, she decides whether or not the harm to her was big enough and harmful enough to accept the punishment she'd also take.

That's the only way I see sexual assault/rape law truly working properly, because there's one critical thing everyone misses about this issue: Sex is an intrinsic and necessary function of humanity, and the only thing that distinguishes it from the horrific acts of violence known as rape are the mental state of both individuals.

When I hear stories like these, my default assumption is that it's some poor guy trying to get his undergrad degree in history so he can go and become an archaeologist and has found himself attending lectures full of fat, purple-haired women who are only there so they can carefully go over every instance of historic prejudice in their textbooks with a yellow highlighter and write about it on Tumblr.

The fact that universities enrol, and graduate these people based on nothing more than doing that is a ringing indictment of the status quo, and I guess the main reason why we're here, but I think if you go and do your bachelors' in, say, chemical engineering you might find it's less bad.

The reasons intelligent people are ignoring the plight of men are complex and varied. It's essentially a positive feedback loop created by our innate psychological tendency to protect women. We want to protect them so we focus on their issues, so the news focuses on female issues, so women get confirmation bias which makes us all more motivated to solve women's issues. Talking about men's problems reduces finite attention on women's issues, which leads to efforts to discredit men's issues.

It's all an ugly mess of people operating in patterns that serve their immediate interest. They aren't taking the time to actually look down the road and consider the consequences of a large group of disenfranchised men. On the contrary, lacking the inherent bias we have for women, the issues of men have led to the demonization of men. When women are disenfranchised, it's oppression. When men are disenfranchised, they're lazy, incompetent, and/or incels. 

The basic bias for women, and lack of it for men, leads to a perpetual inability for most of our population to actually wrestle with the problems plaguing half of our society. And because of the mechanisms that these behaviors and beliefs perpetuate themselves, I don't think it's possible to course correct, because even the most intelligent among us are vulnerable to cognitive bias.

I spent significant periods of time as a NEET in my 20s. In my opinion, it's a fairly predictable response that young men are having to a society that doesn't value them. I don't really begrudge young men for opting out due to that.

However, society better reevaluate its priorities soon if it doesn't want to fall apart or drop into very poor living standards. Men are required to invent, build and maintain. And if they aren't valued, if there isn't a *reason* for them to want to do these things (wife and children usually) many will simply opt out or become dangerously anti-social. In the end, society will face the consequences of it.

You're totally incorrect on this. That is *the* type of job that is not being filled right now. We have a massive shortage of those workers. It's why labor costs have soared and businesses that deal in logistics, food service, construction, and the trades are unable to stay staffed.

This year we are seeing massive layoffs of white collar workers because the tech industry over-hired during the post-pandemic boom. We have much less of a white collar shortage than blue. Most places that employ blue collar workers are struggling to maintain services because they can't find people.

d2wpxr2,t3_4i9smp,2016-05-07 20:53:10,MensRights,"When I went to middle school, there was a girl in my class who loved attention and particularly hated one male teacher who didn't put up with her bullshit. 

One day, she had put double-sided tape on her shirt over her breasts and was sticking anything she could find to them. Scissors, a ruler, construction paper. She was causing a big disturbance. She found a plastic bag, stuck it to her chest, and was running around the room yelling until the teacher grabbed the bag and ripped it off as she ran past.

Her plan had worked. She turned to the class screaming ""you all saw it! He just touched my boobs! He's a pedophile!""

My teacher turned white as a ghost as it dawned on him what had happened. His frustrated attempt to restore order to his classroom; this one simple mistake; was going to ruin his life. He walked out of the room without a word, leaving the class to ourselves for the remainder of the hour. When the bell rang and we opened the door, he was still slumped in the hallway with his head between his knees, crying.

It was over for him. He tried to get ahead of it; to explain what had happened before he could be reported. He even had the entire class to back him up and explain that he had done nothing wrong. But none of that mattered. Enough people either disliked him or just wanted a piece of the drama that they corroborated the girl's story. Whomever makes those kind of decisions concluded that it wasn't worth the risk of allowing him to continue teaching. He was fired, lost his teaching license, and even went to trial.

I'm not sure if he did any jail time. It doesn't really matter, I guess. Either way, his life was ruined. But that look on his face when the girl first made the accusation was haunting; the look of a man who lost everything in a fraction of a second. No more job, his wife would leave him, and he would even have to leave town because of all the rumors floating around. The girl fed off the attention of being a victim... At least until she dropped out at age 16 to support her 3 kids, but never showed any remorse.

From that day on, I gave up any ideas of becoming a teacher or even any activities that might put me near young girls. As a man, it's just not worth the risk.",irrelevant_usernam3,t2_im7ed,37,0,reddit3

d2wnhxw,t3_4i9smp,2016-05-07 19:39:07,MensRights,"It seems to me, that the government leaning in to the push of parents (mostly mothers), creates an environment where kids never grow up, but remain whining teenagers. Who cry a bit and the government gives them what they want. According to UNICEF, if you yell at your kid, it is emotional harassment. I would be curious whether wives are legally capable of emotionally harassing husbands. There are also complaints that competitive environment hurts girls, so it is better to exclude males from classes in certain cases. So in many occasions females are spared of the difficulties of life by the system. If they choose to go to the STEM fields, quotas might help them. If the quota is not reached after the university declares the score limit to be accepted, what will the university do? They calculate the number of women who have to be accepted to meet the quota. Say the ratio has to be 250:50, but only 35 females made the cut. What happens is, the 15 males with the worst scores are sacked, and the top 15 females **not meeting the score** are accepted. In the 40s there was a similar system in some European countries. If a country had 4% Jewish population, then there could be no more than 4% Jewish people at any given major. Afterward some folks came up with other ""progressive"" ideas.

They might have a compensation at the future in their jobs too. In certain fields, employees will be more likely to hire women, simply to be more ""diverse"" workforce and in case of a discrimination case, point fingers at the women in employment. And AFAIK they are more likely to be given holidays when they ask for it. And after they are in their jobs, the invisible oppressive hand is still working. It creates that sexist wage gap. I came across a study conducted by two women, who authored such studies as **[On Pay Gap, Millennial Women Near Parity – For Now](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/12/11/on-pay-gap-millennial-women-near-parity-for-now/)**, **[Breadwinner Moms](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/29/breadwinner-moms/)**. Now this two women made a [study](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/29/breadwinner-moms/) back in '13 about how much time do men and women spend weekly on work. Both paid work, child care, housework, and leisure. Here is the table for ages 18..64:

 | Men | Women | Diff
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:
Total | **45.6** | **45.2** | **0.4**
Paid work | 33.8 | 23.9 | 9.9
Housework | 9.3 | 15.5 | -6.3
Child care | 2.5 | 5.8 | -3.3
Leisure | 33.7 | 29.0 | 4.7

The same table with children less than 18 years old:

 | Men | Women | Diff
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:
Total | **54.9** | **53.0** | **2.0** \(the error is in the source\)
Paid work | 38.4 | 21.6 | 16.8
Housework | 9.5 | 17.7 | -8.2
Child care | 7 | 13.6 | -6.5 \(error in source\)
Leisure | 27.7 | 25.0 | 2.7

So it is totally clear that men worked more on average for money, then women, in 2013. If you happen to find out what percent is the average women's paid work hours of the men's, you get 70.71%. So if men were paid the same money on average for overtime, then women are even overpaid according to [John Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsB1e-1BB4Y), since he states one LadyBuck is ¢77. So the **Equal pay for equal work** is actually **Equal pay for their work**. See?! That's me being politically correct! BTW, the video is dated 8/25/2014. And it talks about 2013 data.

So the question arises, is it worth to be an MRA? As I see the numbers do not matter. The commander in chief is happy to be a white knight, by taking money out from the mutual piggy bank and giving it to women. It seems to me that there are some hypotheses that never change, and politicians act on them all the time. One is that women are oppressed, were oppressed, and will be oppressed. The second is that women always got it worse. Say I'm the 18 year old John Doe living in Austin, TX. The government clearly does not care about me, and women will be always more important. So I have to smarten up. I say, I support bringing in more immigrants from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Libya. I conform more to their norms, than the average female American. So if they will be the ruling social group, they will start by ""fixing up"" things with women. Why would John Doe care about women being raped on the open street in broad daylight, for not being covered up? That's not me being raped. And as long as not one family member of mine, why should I be involved? Supposedly we already live in a rape culture, so women won't really notice the difference. Say in 50 years the US will be an Islam caliphate. Women are not allowed to drive on their own, can't divorce without permission, there's no alimony, if my wife beats me in the head with a frying pan for picking her favorite scarf from the laundry instead of the oil rag, to wipe the Camry's oil pan, what will happen? I can call the police, without fearing that I will be arrested despite every single evidence and the testimony of my children. I can initiate divorce the next day. I won't have to pay alimony, and our relationship will be totally terminated for both of us. Just like a modern western woman can do today. I will probably get custody of the child, since she was beating on me. I will split up the custody nearly equally. Say she's mad at me for holding her responsible for her own actions, and reports me, claiming I abuse my daughter. Police comes investigates, she tells that I never even raised a hand at her mother when she charged at me like a maniac. My son's testimony backs her and my version. She is put into prison for 2 years, and loses her job in the process. Her parents in the process distance themselves from her due to social pressure. After 15 months into her term, the children visit her less frequently. She develops depression and hangs herself in her cell. There are no news reports about a convicted felon who was found guilty of DV and false accusation. The world moves on. Now is it an equal system? No. Is it a fair system? No. Do I have the liberties, I had in the old system? No. But as a male, do I have better outlook for my life? Sure. At this point I recall the old system, women having all the privileges I can recall but wanted more based on bogus claims. So I say to myself,

>*""Why should I feel bad about anything, than my actions? I did not take part in the overthrow of the democratic government. An equal society was clearly not enough for feminism. This system will for sure move the same direction. But it takes so much time, that my son will have almost the same opportunities in life. Marriage, divorce, parenting will be the same for him as a modern western woman had back in the day. If feminism needs privileges for as compensation of the ancient past, my son can do the same, by saying that his father and grandfather were unable to have a choice whether or not they want to be parents, whether or not they can be financially independent from their ex-wives or ex-girlfriends, and were arrested even for DV despite being on the receiving end.""*

And even if I'm wrong about all these facts, I'm still a patriarchal rapist monster, a member of an obsolete oppressive system. That system already existed at the high point of feminism, so I was pretty much born into it, and social pressure formed me into this person I'm in the future. Other people force me into a role, so I bear no responsibility. And speaking of my daughter, she will have nearly all the rights, as her brother. Okay, for adultery she will probably get harsher sentence, than my son. But in the past of feminism, men got more time for the same crime in general. So that's social justice my friends, to compensating for the past. And if I remarry, I can still help out my wife in the kitchen, cheer her up when she is in a bad mood, go to the opera, buy her a new dress for her birthday. Take her out to the sea so we can swim in privacy, even naked. I can help financially with her studies, if she is missing the founds. I can still handle her as an equal peer, and life long partner. And if god forbid one party cheats on the other, every connection and responsibility is terminated by the state, and we both can have a clear start. So why should I worry if feminism is driving the nails into our society's coffin? What simply happens is we move from one extreme to an other. If we are incapable of acknowledging that the battle has been long won, we will always swing between the extremes. That's so simple.

7 and 8 boys are in an awkward transition phase, they go back and forth from being immature to wanting to be heard and respected or treated like ""men."" Only thing I could suggest would be not to coddle them or treat them like kids. They respect you more if you joke around with them and if you help them do their work in a way that praises them. You will always have a few that don't respond to this, but it works with most of them.

Intermediate is a tough balance to strike. I am generally laid back and have a sense of humor, and take very little personally, but I also won't take disrespect by adolescent boys towards me or female students.How you handle these situations is important not only to show boys how to act, but to show young women what they don't have to tolerate.

I keep things (sometimes irritatingly) calm, ask a student in question to speak to me privately (usually in the hall, door open) and remind them of the classroom expectations. If they won't follow them, or are deliberately disrespectful of me or female students, I don't hesitate to send them to the office.

I'm an engineer and a terrible writer.

Couldn't we copy and paste all the feminist arguments to male teachers? That it's important for men to break this unjust and unfounded stereotype. How it's a sexist and hateful view of half the world population. That men hold up half the sky(actually, the sky is held down blah blah blah). 

Teachers are without a doubt an important part of our society. They truly do help shape the future. 

I don't know why, but a lot of women are willing to buy into a feminist sound bites that are just untrue. Back in the 90s, my 2nd grade class was segregated because the female teacher couldn't handle boys. So, we were taught by a student teacher and he did great. Luckily I was too young to really understand what was going on. But now you read all these stories about how medicated the boys are. How education is being restructure to focus on homework instead of test which benefits girls over boys. 

I feel like I could write a laundry list of why it's important to have male teachers. I'm sure you probably know more reason than I. ",unitedamerika,t2_61vh4,6,0,reddit3

A nurse I worked with would constantly hit on me, call me “daddy” or “baby” and Inappropriately place her hands around my shoulders or waist; several times she came up behind me and did it. 

I even recorded her saying disgusting stuff to me and presented that as evidence too. Only to be told “you shouldn’t have had your phone on you during work hours” and “we spoke to her and she said she was only joking and being friendly with you” the recording wasn’t even seriously addressed. 

Well, I finally reached my tipping point a couple weeks ago and confronted her and this is *after* I’ve filed several complaints through HR and the chain of command— only to be ignored and told it’s not that big of a deal; just workplace “horseplay”....

But guess who was just told that by confronting her on my own and in front of my fellow nursing staff (and respectfully so I might add) that due to my behavior she filed a *single* complaint against me (which was immediately handled) saying... “she felt threatened by me” and “afraid for her safety due to my “rage filled outburst”.... 

All I said and calmly so... “was please stop touching me and speaking to me in the way you have. It’s inappropriate and makes me uncomfortable. I do not like it and it’s not a game” to which she cried and made a scene as if it was my fault for taking offense.... 

Smh, this is the world we live in now and I couldn’t imagine what it must feel like to not even see a stall for “men only” at your job... I guess it’s their way of telling you to... piss outside... if the restrooms are full.

NB: they are 3 cubical toilets (sometime a toilet is 2 urinals) with real walls and full doors (not US toilets) in a big room. And big rooms are segregated. So it's not really like OP because it wasn't think the same way.

But it's well thought, when you have 2 men toilets next to each other, the one below, above or both is for women. So whatever your gender you can find one nearby. And I think HR and secretaries (80% women HR and 100% in secretary) are trying to get openspaces near the women toilets.

I haven't heard anyone complained about this. I worked with a woman on the first floor, near men toilets (women's one are above, below is the reception) and before leaving, if she had to, rather than go up one level then down two, she used the men's one and I haven't heard any complaints either, she didn't come to the urinals to check.

How about this. Youre a spy in ww2. Your role is saving millions. Wearing your Nazi uniform you see three French resistance who you know, admire and care for about to be shot. 

Do you blow your cover and attempt to save them? 

Or do you maintain your cover and continue with the war effort as a spy? 

Lets say your a civil rights lawyer and you sue the police. 

Theres a major protest which youre sure will turn violent. You believe in the cause.

i can careless about bathrooms if it was single stall. but the point is, in above, women are given special treatment.

lets put it like this:

if 4 men are waiting for the rest room, 1 of them would be waiting outside, where as if the gender was reversed, all 4 women can go w/o any problem.

lets put it like this so your simple mind can understand....instead of gender, lets use race for those stalls.

4 stalls total. all 4 can be used by whites.
but only 2 stalls can be used by blacks.

Another thing of course is that what a lot of people think of as ""Europe"" is just Germany, France, Spain, Italy and the UK, which only make up ten percent of the countries in Europe.

Most feminists do hate men's rights and MGTOW though. And I've noticed that most trad con women as well as MRA women also hate MGTOW.

And that is my point. A men's rights activist who calls a man going his own way an incel cannot expect to be taken seriously and not be called an incel himself by another group. You see, as far as blue pilled majority is concerned we are all incels. It's just amusing to see an MRA deploying the same shaming and dismissive tactics on MGTOW as feminists use against MRAs.

>I don't really like MGTOW subreddit because despite originally focusing on getting men's rights

MGTOW has never been about men's rights. If you go to that subredit expecting that, of course you will leave disappointed. It's been about shedding traditional men's roles and responsibilities, nothing more.

>more and more people joined which brought in an influx of incels and people who genuinely hate women

I disagree with that statement. Of course you can read into MGTOW content as ""woman-hating"", but the same could be said (and is being said) about MRA content really. What you read as ""woman hating"" on that subreddit I read as mostly just search for validation of their philosophy. For example if there is a post that reads something like ""Look at this bitch who claimed she 'need no man' but also collects child support"". This could be interpreted as hating on a woman, but it also could be read as a warning to not participate in the institution of marriage leading to this kind of situation.

For that matter there actually a lot more content that can be read as man-hating on that sub. Something like ""Another simp marries a past-wall bitch after she rode the cock carousel for 15 years. What a moron"". They are clearly hating on this man and his choices right? Not really, just validating their views.",illCodeYouABrain,t2_bs3h3,5,0,reddit1

If you follow the link to the study, what they propose is...

>How might these results change the focus of research or clinical practice?   
>  
>► Promoting the regular workweek of 35–40 hours might be an effective strategy for preventing diabetes among women.

I normally would not have an issue with this as long as women get paid for the work they do, but with this *wage gap* horseshit being pushed as a major agenda item, I'm afraid I'll have to oppose this in principle. If women need to earn as much as men in the aggregate for their to be 'equality' feminist style, then women are just going to have to put in the hours.",tenchineuro,t2_3nrxdp,163,0,reddit2

Yes and the connection was negative.  From the abstract of the study referenced:

HR is ""Hazard Ratio"" for developing diabetes.  It was positive for shift workers, but negative for non-shift workers.  So the CNN article is saying there's a ""connection"", implying a positive correlation, when the opposite is true.",Supernumiphone,t2_lztzw,7,0,reddit2

Working more hours hasn’t been shown to **increase the risk of diabetes** any more than living in a crime-ridden neighborhood *increases the risk* you’ll commit a crime.




Working more hours is *correlated with* an increase in diabetes diagnoses. Just like living in a high crime area *is correlated with* crime, and living in a predominantly gay area *is correlated with people who engage in homosexual sex.*


But working long hours doesn’t increase your RISK. Just as living in a high crime hood doesn’t make you more likely to commit a crime (if you’re law abiding, you won’t) nor does living in a gay area make you more likely to engage in homosexual sex.




Correlation doesn’t imply causation.

##The Facts about the Gender Wage Gap in Canada

The gender wage gap is the difference in earnings between women and men in the workplace.

It is a widely recognized indicator of women’s economic equality, and it exists to some extent in every country in the world.

A 2015 UN Human Rights report raised concerns about “the persisting inequalities between women and men” in Canada, including the “high level of the pay gap” and its disproportionate effect on low-income women, racialized women, and Indigenous women.1

Out of 34 countries in the OECD, Canada had the 7th highest gender wage gap in 2014.2 To learn more about economic inequality in Canada, see",tenchineuro,t2_3nrxdp,5,0,reddit2

It certainly *seems* like a problem that could be related to sexism or similar factors.

The answer, of course, is because women don't work in dangerous jobs as much as men, meaning they're rarely in a position to die due to a workplace accident, so it makes sense that a higher percentage of women's workplace deaths would be due to someone deliberately trying to kill them. It's just something that isn't immediately apparent just from the raw data.

To isolate for workplace shooting, you need to remove other causes of death from the equation. Total number of men murdered, total number of women murdered, and compare those % of total people murdered to the breakdown of hours worked by sex.

Dear Mr. Keating, 

I’m writing you to urge you to redress some false implications made in an article you recently authored titled: “Murder is the second most likely way for women to die at work”.

While the title (by itself) of your article is indeed correct, you implicitly state within the 2nd paragraph of the article that the issue of workplace murders “disproportionately affects women”. This is simply not true and is not supported by any honest statistical analysis. A correct interpretation of the stats (once you normalize the numbers and correct for total hours worked) suggests that men are 1.4 times more likely to be murdered at work than women, and more men are murdered at work each year than the total number of women workplace deaths.  

If you’re trying to draw readers attention to specific domestic violence issues facing women, or to the injustice of fellow journalist comrades being gunned down in their offices at the hands of violent fanatics, then your efforts are obscured by playing games of gender politics and pushing statistical misrepresentations. Readers deserve better than this.

Wrong. The problem with the article is false correlation and reversing causality. The rate of death does not influence the rate of murder, but the reverse is true. It doesn't matter how many men die on the job of non murder causes when trying to make a supporting statement of women's safety at work. You look at the total number of men murdered, the total number of women murdered and you compare that to the total number of men murdered at work to the total number of women at work. When you do that the authors assumed position falls apart.

What's even worse about this is women are at much more risk to be murdered outside the workplace. When taking all murders (on or off the job) into account, 66% are males, 33% are females. But when we look at the ratio of male to female murders it is roughly 80% male to 20% female. Now, male to female work ratio isn't equal. Of all hours worked approximately 60% are by men and 40% by women, so that increases a man's chance of being murdered at work some and lowers a woman's chance, but still doesn't explain the discrepancy.

Until you compare it to the odds of women dying. Let's say the odds of a woman dying is 0.01% per hour worked. Again, too small to represent, so you do it like you did the men's.

If you look up total murder stats for each sex and look at risk of being murdered at work for each sex you see that 3% (+/- .5%) of murders for each sex occur at work. What is most amazing about that number is how equal it is. Your risk of being murdered on the job is inline with your risk of being murdered outside the job. 

[Using the authors method, we would assume ice cream sales cause murder](http://blog.minitab.com/blog/understanding-statistics/three-dangerous-statistical-mistakes). The author tries to make a two way causation between a one way correlation. Murders increase the death statistics, but deaths do not increase the murder statistics. It doesn't matter how many men slip and fall, it does not increase the risk of a woman being murdered. 

You'll see this same tactic commonly used in anti-global warming articles. You cherry pick a dataset to show the conclusion you want, you specifically cannot show any other datasets or the visualization disappears. For example if you show two pie charts of just the risk of being murdered on the job they look almost exactly the same.

In truth, the likelihood of being murdered at work could be equal across genders or even *greater* amongst men, but if women are *less likely* to die from other causes then that style of graph will make it appear that women are disproportionately murdered on the job.

For example, a workplace with 50 male employees and 50 female employees could have 2 male employees murdered on the job and 2 female employees murdered on the job. Equal numbers. If however male employees also saw 8 accidental deaths on the job while female employees only saw 2, a stacked graph like that will show that men only have a 20% chance of being murdered on the job while women have a whopping *50% chance!* Stripped of numerical context, this leads many people to assume that women are being murdered more than men on the job or that women have a greater chance of being murdered even though both men and women are *equally as likely* to be murdered at work.

The *honest* way of framing it would be to compare the total number of women who are murdered at work to the total number of men who are murdered at work.

No, it wouldn't. About as insignificant whether you're using the word ""keel"" or ""Kiel"", or ""rudder"" or ""Ruder"". Speaking about ships the word comes from Old Norse, opening a category of ""slaying that is unjustified by Norse morals"", as opposed to normal slaying. We're not Vikings, so <your morals> apply.

> Murder isn't defined by a jurisdiction

...yes, it is. The German legal definition, for example, is rather singular:

> A murderer is any person who kills a person for pleasure, for sexual gratification, out of greed or otherwise base motives, by stealth or cruelly or by means that pose a danger to the public or in order to facilitate or to cover up another offence.

I'm not linking the translated code because it translates both ""Totschlag"" and ""Mord"" as ""Murder"", not the former as ""manslaughter""... which would still be confusing, but much less so. AFAIK most codes of law consider both ""murder"". So, yes, it gets defined.

>  and the abstract concept of unjustified killing does not tell us enough information to know if something is a murder. 

So if codes of law don't give us a definitions, and the abstract concept doesn't tell us anything... so we can't say anything about it. Am I getting that right?

> Not true. Murder doesn't concern itself with if something is ""unjustified"" or not.

A term for a crime that is not concerned with justness? Colour me surprised. Can there be e.g. theft of something that's your own? Do firefighters kidnap babies out of  burning buildings?

It's still not the word ""murder"" though.  It's German, with its own definitions, even if they are extremely similar and often used as in translations.

I think a better example would be corrupt cops that are acting with in the law when committing unjustified homicide.  They won't be labeled as murderers by the government.  The law has to draw lines about what is a crime and how to punish for those crimes.  The term is a specific label for type of homicide.

What the fuck does this have to do with anything?  Who cares?  

The point was that ""government approved murder"" is simply an oxymoron.  That's all my original post was stating, and you are wanting to get into it.  It's a simple concept though.  If it is government approved, it's not murder.  End of story.  German words can be defined differently, but they aren't the English word for ""murder.""

Wrong. The problem with the article is false correlation and reversing causality. The rate of death does not influence the rate of murder, but the reverse is true. It doesn't matter how many men die on the job of non murder causes when trying to make a supporting statement of women's safety at work. You look at the total number of men murdered, the total number of women murdered and you compare that to the total number of men murdered at work to the total number of women at work. When you do that the authors assumed position falls apart.

>3.5% of male murders occur at work.

> 2.5% of female murders occur at work.

Now take that the split between total worked hours is 60% men and 40% women, the entire premise crashes down into the realm of utter falsehood.",,,1,0,reddit3

Why is it ok for there to not be an equal number of sewer workers or street sweepers?  There’s way more of those jobs around than CEOs or partners in law firms!  

The real point here is that feminists only want equal (or superior) numbers of women in plum jobs: that pay well and have status in our society.  If a job is not well paid or not valued by society (ie people doing it aren’t given respect), they don’t care if it’s only men who do it.  As an example, firefighters have a degree of status even if they’re not all that well paid, so feminists demand that women have lower physical requirements so more women can enter the jobs.  They don’t care if it endangers people’s lives to have someone in such a position who lacks the necessary physical strength.  The fire service is respected by people because they save lives, and they want to be damn sure that as many women as possible are getting that respect.  Garbage collectors and sewer workers (not to mention builders labourers) are essential, but are less respected as they don’t so clearly save lives as firemen do.  So feminists don’t care, and don’t demand the roles be made more women friendly.  Even separatist feminists who give out lists of female mechanics, electricians, plumbers etc so that women won’t have to have any contact with a man don’t care if it’s men who collect the garbage or keep the sewer flowing.",Angryasfk,t2_4h5eu4lg,25,0,reddit4

I can see why on this one.  Just ran the jrpat for pre-employment screening, that shit is brutal.  Have to complete it in under 8 minutes, wearing a 50 lb vest to simulate gear.  Drag a charged hose, then sling a high rise pack (70 lbs) over your shoulder (now caring 120 lbs on your frame), and climb the stairs twice (about three-four total flights of a residential home).  Untrained guys are gassed at that point, untrained women may not even be able to shoulder the pack.  Then ceiling push/pull simulator (moving a 70 lb weight on a lever with a pike pole), ladder raise, Kaiser sled (driving a 70 lb steel beam with a sledge hammer two feet, that's a lot of heavy, hard swinging), pull and lower under control a high rise pack 40 feet (once again, that 70 lb weight), AND FINALLY drag a 175 lb dummy like 50 feet.

My training background is powerlifting and running, albeit riding the pine for a year before starting back up a month ago, and it took me 7:30 and was gassed at the end, no wonder women are so underrepresented.

Often multiple flights of stairs are an obstacle if they died at home.  Sometimes a family insists on watching your every move so you gotta tighten strain to be extra gentle and careful.  Some people are hoarders and you have an obstacle course to contend with.

I have no idea what I would do all day if I didn't work- it's especially hard to go do something when you _have no money because you're not working._ Women don't seem to need a real purpose in life though- they're perfectly content to live completely meaningless lives with no actual goals and happy to never achieve anything at all.

Feminism was a complete and utter failure and the fact that 84% of women polled say they want to be housewives is the ultimate proof Feminism failed. And it was stupid from the very beginning.

You're not going to believe this, but women have an extremely difficult time just simply adhering to a set schedule, showing up on time, working all day and coming in everyday and being reliable. Women are insanely flaky and squirrely- exactly the same way they are in relationships- fickle, moody, unaccountable and great deal of that attitude comes from their spiteful nature like some kind of insolent teenager, ""You can't MAKE me do anything, I don't have to do what you say, na na na na na,"" extremely, extremely childish behavior. This notion that TV and movies try to push that it is men who are irresponsible and flaky is complete bullshit and it's the opposite. If men were are unreliable and spiteful and immature as women, the entire infrastructure would collapse.

Women just want STATUS- that is what they really, really want; to be able to say they are some title with some degree, thus making themselves 'better' than others. And of course to just prove that they can finish school and get a degree. But the actual day to day work they despise and see that as below them. That's why the few women who DO go to college and become something serious like doctors or engineers quit after just a few years. 

And it's also why in 50 years since they gained equal rights, 95% of  women have never just rolled up their sleeves and gotten to work competing with men in the workplace. 

They simply don't want to be at work and really 99% of them simply CAN'T work a full time job day after day for years. That's why the turnover is so dramatic with women and they leave the workforce at 3 times the rate as men. Women are just not suited for the workplace; too emotional, always sick, too moody, too volatile, too jealous, spiteful, petty and vindictive.

And women's values are radically different from men and they have drastically different goals. Plus being able to sit at home all day and not have to work is yet another status level they want to achieve to present themselves as 'better' than the rest. ",Ovendice,t2_bb6yt,4,0,reddit1

And women make such horrendous managers anyway because they're so flaky, moody and psycho and irresponsible, even women _themselves_ hate female management. Just one of dozens of studies about that very topic over the last 20 years:
http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-16/women-dislike-having-female-bosses-more-than-men-do

The saddest part of all is that floor manager or the lowest management position is the only thing you can even do with a female because they don't do any actual work and refuse to work under a quota in sales, so it's the only thing you can even do with them most of the time and they can't even manage to do that with any competency at all.

Women are pretty much just dead weight and a liability in the workplace just looking to file a lawsuit based on a false accusation and you can't ever be alone with them in the office without witnesses because false accusations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are now an epidemic:

I had exactly the same experience as her - made redundant from my job and stayed at home with young kids for a couple of months while my wife found shifts as a casual teacher.

Aside from the depression one feels after losing a bread winning job, and the financial stress (we ended up selling our house, pulling the kids put of school and moving in with family before I found work again), I can honestly say it was the happiest time for me as a father.

I really enjoyed the tasks of making the lunches, and once my wife got over the fact that I was in charge of cooking and cleaning but still learning, I think I handled things pretty well. Even hanging out the endless washing was nice, we had a beautiful sunny back yard, and my pre school daughter would potter about in the grass while I sung a song and got the job done. I realised that while I'd been working all that time to pay for it - I'd never actually just been outside on a stress free Tuesday morning in the sunshine doing a kind of pleasant task. when I was working I only ever went out there to more the lawn or fix the fence. But now I was taking time with my daughter to have a nap in the hammock between tasks, or one time we made people goop with corn flour and water.

And yes, the picking kids up from school was kind of tedious - but my daughter loved riding in the bike seat, and my son loved being the only kid at school who rode there on his little bike with training wheels.

Like I said, aside from the crippling guilt and depression from the redundancy and subsequent unemployment those are really very precious memories for me. of course I eventually got a job and all those times stopped and now I have to endure watching my wife revile the only job that ever gave me deep satisfaction.

I had to stop reading when the author started talking about that being a female issue - as if fathers aren't cut to the bone by the experiences they miss out on, as if fathers universally prefer the burden of being the one who gives up on family life for the sake of necessary dollars.

I fucking WISH I was in that woman's shoes, of being able to just choose to not work for years at a time and have my partner just continue to meet all our financial commitments by herself. I'm not exactly complaining - I'm an engineer and my wife is a teacher who can't teach for medical reading: obviously I'm the one with the primary income potential. And my wife is not bad natured about her tasks, I can just tell she is completely sick of it now. If she could find work now we'd be in less danger of losing our house, but if we could find a way of paying or reducing our bills I'd be personally happy with her never working because the truth is I prefer having her around at home and being able to see her friends and family.

I'm digressing. The author of that article can go fuck herself if she thinks that life is unfair if she can't be a full time parent as well as a full time worker. That's something I cope with on a daily basis, but no one asks how I feel about out as a father.

(actually, as it turns out, I work a pretty flexible 40 hours and only work 5 minutes from home, so I've missed out on a hell of a lot less than most, but the fact remains that I'm at work all day and my wife is at home/Dr/shops/post office/whatever)

I wish this article were inclusive of everyone. It should be ""people can't have it all!"" It shouldn't be about women, it should be about families and if not about families then about the individual. The US has a ridiculous demand of its workers and little respect for the family. I'm a nanny and I see the imbalance of parenting styles and choices which occur when one spouse works all the time and the other is home raising the children/doing projects while running the house. 

I've watched kids with families where the mom works and the dad is home and where there are same sex parents - it doesn't matter - if one is working all. the. time or both are working 40+ hour weeks it's the family, and the individuals within the family who suffer. 

I understand the point of the article, which is that women who work (and/or the one with the less 'serious' job) and who have a spouse who also works are often expected to take on the 'main' parenting role. In my experience, this is true, and it causes stress and strain among the parents and an uneven structure with the kid. It isn't really the fault of the parents, it's just how things tend to happen. It's the job of the parents to maintain communication about expectations in their relationship. Yes, the business needs to make exceptions for parents but to place blame entirely on business when the issue is structuring of responsibilities in the home isn't really fair or honest. 

If my husband and I both work white collar jobs which require a lot of our effort and time, and we have children, then it is our job to ensure that we take equal time and attention from our jobs to give to parental responsibilities. 

TL;DR:  We need companies to give longer maternity leave and include paternity leave, and to respect  family units and workers as people. In the home we need to have a better outline of expectations on parenting responsibilities.

This is sexist and gross. Men typically don't write 'whiny articles' about things like that not because they're some virtuous worker who is able to rise above their role but because it has been their expected role for so very long that they often don't feel they have a choice. They're also dissuaded from expressing their personal emotions in front of a large audience and they're treated as an anomaly (seriously, the articles I've read treat them like fucking magical unicorns) if they want to be the one to stay home with their kids.  

Men must put themselves into the role of 'breadwinner', and because they don't get to spend much time with their family, making money for their family is how they contribute. If more men were 'burdened' with childcare in our traditional family structure then they might feel they have more room for complaining about missing their kids' lives or spending time with their SO's. Currently, they aren't expected to even think about those things (or like them that much), only providing for their family. Women experience the exact opposite demeaning role. 

This ties into what men face in child custody decisions and child support payments vs time spent with children - they're not the heart of their family, they're only the money maker, so their cash and not their presence is important.

I actually think that is what the submitter is trying to say here. As many people have pointed out, guys sacrifice a lot to get those high status jobs. The problem that this article illustrates is that a woman in the same position resents the sacrifices and wants advancement without the work. 

I am right there with her. I want the advancements without the work too. Hell, I deserve them. So do you too, probably. The reality is that it is a competition, the one that wins is the one that is willing to do more to reach the goal. 

From the article: 
*I cringe when I hear well educated, successful women refer to their ""choice"" to spend more time with kids rather than stay on a high-powered career track. They should never have to make that choice in the first place.*

Umm, why? You want that success, you have to beat out all the others that want it too. That means sacrifice. Guys have understood that and been doing it all along. It would appear that someone didn't understand the sacrifices that half the population has been making and instead viewed it as privilege. 

However, let's drop the ""bashing"" part of this and deal with a couple of gems in this article: 

From the article: 
*Certainly, it is controversial to suggest that women are disproportionately compelled to want more flexibility and more time at home than men.*

Nope not controversial at all. Often it is an earnings issue depending on the family situation. Maternity leave, etc. This needs to change. 

The change that feminists want is to bring women's pay up to the level of guys that don't take long stretches off from the payroll, but that is unrealistic. What needs to happen is that guys need to reduce their work time and work more flexible jobs, and accept the lower pay that comes with that, in order to not make the sacrifices that this society (Patriarchy even, although in this case, heavily supported by feminists, since it serves their interests) wants of them. (As a beneficial aside, we will have pay equity, even if not the way that feminists want). 

From the article: 
*It will require men to support this effort, since they are the ones who now hold the levers of power.*

Yes, and no. Yes, it will require men to support this effort, since they are the ones that are going to have to draw back on the competing for top status jobs and push society to accept that men want personal time with their families too, and that there should be respect for that instead of looking down on them for not 'pushing to get ahead'. 

No, it has very little to do with 'men holding the power', since the men at the very top aren't really the personality we are talking about. Those personalities aren't capable of stopping being competitive. 

See, the issue is, not everyone gets to be 'leaders'. If you want to realize your capabilities as leader, then you have to make the sacrifices to get there. The reward is pay and status, the sacrifice is time and work-life balance. If women want to compete with guys who won't take time out of their career for maternity leave, then they need to not have children or make their leave as short as possible and push harder to make up for the lost time. It's a competition, and as long as the reward is significant, there will be those, men and women, that go after it with everything they have. 

However, if the 'middle class' guy balances out his life more, we will actually have a much better society, in my opinion. As both genders will have the ability to have reasonable, flexible employment and far better work life balance and their will be more respect for men in the parenting role. (I already believe there is respect for women in the earning role). 

Unfortunately, on the road from here to there, you have to see families accepting to do with less. Since most already need two incomes to survive, it is hard to see how to get there from here. ",Arby01,t2_935e0,3,0,reddit3

ca7bbht,t1_ca76i6i,2013-05-28 06:05:34,MensRights,"Urges mean fuck all. For example, when I see an attractive woman, I have an urge to sleep with her. Does that mean I can force myself on her sexually and eschew consequences by citing my biological urges? Of course not, because civilized society hinges in part on the recognition that individuals cannot freely act on their baser urges at any time without penalty. So the biological drive to motherhood does not suddenly entitle a woman to reproduce and then face no adverse consequences from society. Society needn't modify itself to accommodate a woman because she CHOOSES to reproduce while simultaneously attempting to participate in the workforce. And make no mistake about it...in the era of safe and effective contraception and abortion, it is a choice, and one that rests ultimately with the women.

And your attempt to draw a cross-gender correlation is absurd at best. The concern is not with a woman's sexual activity, but with the real-world consequences of it. If a woman has copious amounts of sex without reproducing, we would not expect it to impair her work, and consequently, it would not enter into any discussion of her career trajectory. When there is a baby, it enters the picture only insofar as it interferes with her capacity to continue working the same quantity of hours. Were she to give the baby up for adoption, and therefore return to normal work shortly after delivery, there would again be no issue. So it isn't about treating the sexuality of men and women differently, but about holding individuals accountable based on their capacity to contribute labor. That it is women who are most apt to change their hours to be more involved parents is not the fault of industry, and is not something which should entitle them to special consideration.

>Then the feminist hoaxers come along and they decide to compalin that women are soooo oppresed by the fact that they have the priviledge to all those choices men don't have. That's tough, how are they going to hoax people like that when its so obvious women are better off?

>Simple: they only count cake. Nothing else counts. They actually pretend there isn't anything else going on at all --- sort of ignore that and hope no one catches on. They scream loudly ""it so unfair that the men have more cake! the women must be given more cake!"".

>They prove men have more cake --- not by comparing men with the few women (eg single women to pierce the analogy!) who chose to only have cake --- those women got just as much cake as the men did. No, they compare the total amount of cake men get with the women, but they don't count in any of the other stuff the women choce to get instead of cake.

Except now, they're actually *acknowledging* that they have the choice, but somehow framing it as a burden. They get less and less rational and fair-minded, more and more childish and delusional. She's proclaiming how much she loves being with her kids. How is that not enough? Where did she get the idea that she could get the best of everything for nothing?

The freedom to decide is too much for her. You could take the ""puts the work-life balance burden on us"" quote and use it to justify putting women back in the kitchen.

True, and the discussion would be how/could/should we remove that option. No longer could you simply be willing to work X more hours than the other person to get the job.

Think of it this way.  Before trade unions there were no laws  providing for a 40 hour work week.  It took men banding together to demand fair pay and time off from greedy employers eho otherwise have no incentive to work employees less tan 20 hours a day 7 days a week, as slave labor.  The workers needed time off, they needed to provide for their families monetarily. According to your statement, it should be ok for industry to demand 80 hours a week for the salary you are getting paid at your job.  Is it a worker's fault for having less capacity to work if he refuses to work 80 hours a week?  Millions of trade union workers that fought for your 40 hour work week didnt think so, and you now legally reap the reward of their effort.

Women likewise are now demanding that industry adjust to their needs as mothers.  Lots of employers recognize this need and provide on campus daycare, nursing time, permit bring the child to work, or flex hours.  An employer who does not recognize this need loses the benefit of her skill.  

It is up to the employer to comply with reasonable expectations of workers and if thy wont do it voluntarily, the workers will strive to change the law to force them to do it.

1. It seems like a bad idea to jump the gun and label every woman who decides to talk about family life and working life a feminist. Like, would it be fair to label Phyllis Schlafly a feminist just because she talked about the need to women to stay home?

2. It also seems bad to fail to differentiate between the different kinds of things that different kinds of feminists say. I will admit that this author is writing about a kind of feminist concern, one in which is most often described as a kind of liberal feminism. But there a problems with the concerns this author writes which aren't readily apparent if one thinks that all feminism is the same feminism. So, the stronger criticism is that though she writes about women, she doesn't reflect the foundation of Marxist, post-structuralist, or much 3rd wave feminism.

This last point is most important (but seems a lot of MRAs seem to resist it) because though sometimes MRAs levy real criticisms at *areas of thought* within feminism as a greater discourse, those criticisms rarely hold because the use of ""Feminism"" or ""Feminist"" (which is so often in all caps). The use of the generic Feminism fails to account for the internal criticism in which the (for example) the ideas of Marxists feminism and feminists of color have taken to liberal feminism. Often MRA criticisms are supported by the works of these other *kinds* of feminists. For example, bell hooks has regularly discussed that the need of black men and women are not addressed at all within liberal feminism.

Initially, I was responding to your criticism that this isn't ""men's rights"" but is instead something to ""dog on women"". 

I think you're wrong. I, personally, absolutely hate the ""this isn't men's rights"" bullshit comments, since it's purpose isn't to explore a topic but simply to stifle other's speech. 

Regardless, this is relevant because it is pointing out a serious difference in employment outlook between genders that has direct implications on a number of relevant topics, such as the ideas of the ""glass ceiling"", and ""equal pay"". 

The rest of the comment addresses both the general idea of your comment; 

>TL;DR: We need companies to give longer maternity leave and include paternity leave, and to respect family units and workers as people. In the home we need to have a better outline of expectations on parenting responsibilities.

and the article in general, as well as pointing out specifically, that this article being posted here is not simply woman bashing as there are specific elements that people should be thinking about. I then provided some of my thoughts on the issues. 

> If the family and individual were taken seriously you wouldn't have to have people doing with less because they're into their families. There are plenty of countries (and companies) that value their workers' lives and family roles and still pay them well - they don't necessarily force them to make those decisions.

I believe that you have confused the rank and file with the apex. Yes, there are plenty of companies that value their workers and their families and still pay them well. Absolutely. They aren't the top paying jobs and no company rewards an employee for being 'balanced'. An employee is rewarded for productivity. An employee that works more is more productive. When I talked about the major changes needed that I think would make a better society, it is this level I was talking about.   

However, the author of the article isn't talking about that level. She is talking about the apex jobs. The executive level. You don't get there without sacrifice, and no company is going to advance someone who doesn't compete hard to get there. 

>It's as simple as companies with sabbatical policies for their employees - they require or leave room for these things without punishing the worker.

Sure, but when advancement time comes around, those who have not taken those breaks and worked hard to put the employer ahead will get the advancement. It isn't ""punishing the worker"", it's ""rewarding the worker who put more time in"". 

> weird sexist undertones (two-way street of sexism).

I am assuming you are referring to my couple of comments on feminism. 
Sexism is a two way street. However, I feel that feminist organizations prop up sexism when it is their best interest (divorce, child custody, etc) and decry it when it works against them (unequal opportunity) and use it as an excuse when they don't have equal outcome (I don't get to be president of my company and take time off and work less hours. This is the thrust of the article). 

As a note, when I refer to ""feminists"", I am actually referring to feminist organizations and activism. Feminist organizations have successfully bastardized the definition of the word ""feminist"" to have such a flexible meaning as to be meaningless. Therefore, I define ""feminists"" by the actions of feminist advocacy and activism groups. Otherwise, you get those chiming in with ""you believe in equality, congrats, you are a feminist"" or ""NAFALT"". So, in my opinion, feminism is defined by it's political actions. Individual ""feminists"" and how they identify with feminism are irrelevant.  

Ultimately, and this is more a response to the article than to you, I feel that the solution is for society to change their criteria for evaluating successful men to not look down on those that balance their priorities instead of chasing employment advancement. That means that the mid-level manager and below will be more balanced. It also means that men's incomes will drop since they compete less. That will have a side effect of providing the ""pay equity"" that is sought. This is the area where sabbaticals, etc will make a difference.  

>You also seem to be washing over the roles and standards that both men and women fight against in society

Nope, I was specifically talking about the expectations that guys face in society and how they have to fight against them to change this issue and how that will improve society, in my opinion, as a whole. I didn't really touch on the societal expectations on women and how that affects the issue at all. Although, I certainly understand your confusion as I buried those statements within my topic.

ca7gdoq,t1_ca7g3vq,2013-05-28 14:34:07,MensRights,"> Think of it this way. Before trade unions there were no laws providing for a 40 hour work week. It took men banding together to demand fair pay and time off from greedy employers eho otherwise have no incentive to work employees less tan 20 hours a day 7 days a week, as slave labor. The workers needed time off, they needed to provide for their families monetarily. According to your statement, it should be ok for industry to demand 80 hours a week for the salary you are getting paid at your job. Is it a worker's fault for having less capacity to work if he refuses to work 80 hours a week? Millions of trade union workers that fought for your 40 hour work week didnt think so, and you now legally reap the reward of their effort.

I don't have a 40 hour work week. In my industry, 80 hour weeks are not in the least bit uncommon. And you know what? I understood that going in, and am not especially bothered by it. Would I rather work 40 hours a week? Sure. Would I be willing to halve my salary? Not really. So, given the choice, am I willing to work 80 hours a week? Clearly.

I have no issue whatsoever with industry self-regulation and the freedom of contract. And I have zero regard for the past efforts of unions. That they fought for a particular set of working conditions, virtually all of which are professionally irrelevant to me, are unconvincing of their need. 

That employees have obligations outside of work is their concern, not that of their employers'. Now, presumably if they have sufficient skill, there will be some latitude shown to them, because of competitive pressure within industry. But to insist that the law enshire said protections is fundamentally objectionable.

> Women likewise are now demanding that industry adjust to their needs as mothers. Lots of employers recognize this need and provide on campus daycare, nursing time, permit bring the child to work, or flex hours. An employer who does not recognize this need loses the benefit of her skill.

And I am fine with that. Corporations are by nature self-interested. And if advantaging themselves requires making certain accommodations, including those you listed, I would never take issue with it. Where I object, and it has nothing to do with gender, is where the proposed reform is mandated by government. 

> It is up to the employer to comply with reasonable expectations of workers and if thy wont do it voluntarily, the workers will strive to change the law to force them to do it. That is why maternity leave laws exist, so your claim that women are not entitled to special consideration has no basis in reality as the law already exists.

This is a silly non-point. Your argument is ""in the past, industry has been bullied by a government that was lobbied by a special interest group, and therefore because it has been done, it should be done more."" Sorry, but that isn't how it works. Governments' past actions were illegitimate, and categorically so will their future actions if/when they overstep their bounds by attempting to regulate the labor market.

A major reason for the low annual hours worked in Europe is a relatively high amount of paid annual leave.[30] Fixed employment comes with four to six weeks of holiday as standard.""

And: ""Over the 20th century, work hours declined by almost half, mostly due to rising wages brought about by renewed economic growth, with a supporting role from trade unions, collective bargaining, and progressive legislation. The workweek, in most of the industrialized world, dropped steadily, to about forty hours after World War II. The decline continued at a faster pace in Europe: for example, France adopted a 35-hour workweek in 2000. In 1995, China adopted a 40-hour week, eliminating half-day work on Saturdays. Working hours in industrializing economies like South Korea, though still much higher than the leading industrial countries, are also declining steadily.""

2. All feminists believe in two things that are relevant to any discussion of men's rights. **A.** Patriarchy **B.** Male Privilege. Their belief in these two things predicate a fundamental reliance on **C.** Male Disposability (for instance who is going to finance this irate feminist's demand that womyn be allowed to work 37.5 hours but reap the rewards of a 90 hour workweek? **Answer:** Men.) With these universal feminist beliefs and their universal reliance on Male Disposability as a means to an end, all feminists CAN be lumped together because their disparate beliefs all contain the same central thread, ""that women deserve the fruits of male labor at no cost."" And when you recognize this, feminism is no different from traditionalism (which you childishly call patriarchy), except in how it refuses to provide males any benefit for their labor. Ironically, Traditionalism kept the carrot in front of men and so men stayed on the hamster wheel, ever running and carrying civilization on our backs. Feminism has removed that paltry carrot and in doing so has awakened a generation of men to the reality that **we are being goaded to work ourselves to death so that others may benefit.** You feminists bemoan the fact that you don't receive the same benefits that men who slave every day gain through their devotion to work while you kick back and refuse to work the same backbreaking hours. You refused to feed the golden goose, the workhorse of civilization and in doing so convinced it that it is better served leaving the farm. And now you are the petulant farmers complaining that you no longer reap the enormous benefits of our labor in exchange for your current pathetic contribution.

Feminism = Traditionalism - Male Privilege. That's the formula, pal. You espouse traditionalist beliefs minus any notion of benefit for men. That's how we recognize you as feminist. Your entire view of the world is one that necessarily relies on the fruits of male labor but rejects recompense. We don't care about disagreement among those who follow your basic behavioral pattern.

Why do we tax people, if this ""collective good"" doesn't exist/does not matter? Why do we have all kinds of regulations for companies, regarding work security and waste disposal? Heck, we even got something as minimum wages in many countries! 

As long as we live in a democracy, the people are (at least in theory..) in power and can set rules, as they see fit. We live in a world with tons of arbitrary rules anyway, but any new arbitrary rules are unreasonable? How so? All of these rules are in place to protect society and it's members. 

Of course companies profit from long working hours and cheap labor. As we can see! The rich are getting even richer and the poor...stay poor or become even poorer. Why would anyone be in favor of that? Labor contracts are arbitrary contracts, since in modern societies you often can't say who produced what kind of worth, especially in service or research. All you get there is some kind of ""going rate"", which is fine per se. But in times of stagnant wages, this results in the said problem, unqual distribution of wealth. People work harder and are more productive, but don't receive equal amounts of money for that increase in productivity.

Why all of this matters? In the end, the people should rule in a democracy. A society that only benefits 10% or even less of society, will get into problems sooner or later. I'm from Germany and our economy is praised all over the news. But the truth is, only companies and their shareholders profit. The bottom lower 50% lost up to 20% in real income over a decade. We have millions of people with full-time jobs, who still receive government benefits, because they can't live off their wages. Our middle class is breaking apart, mostly dropping into poverty. And now you think that doesn't matter at all? Only individuals should decide how much they sacrifice? Well, ask the people at the lower end about sacrifices. Working longer hours, being more productive, still losing 20% income. All of this happened in a certain political climate, which still is in place and will only result in further problems for us Germans and the whole of Europe.

All of this is kinda off-topic for men's rights. But do you think under these circumstances anyone in the bottom 50% would dare to ask for any rights? I've read news articles, where people with 30 year work experience went to work for 5€ (6.50$) per hour here. That is plainly illegal, but still common because people are that desperate to feed their families.

Everyone needs some kind of economic basis for their existance. Especially kids, who can't provide for themselves. I' rather see a society where people can earn enough money through their work to live off that money. Instead of a society, where people work hard and long hours and the shareholders reap the benefits, creating some kind of freakish super-elite in the top 1%, owning some 35% of the wealth of the nation (like in the us). (top 10% 50% of the wealth. Bottom 60% -> 4% of wealth)

Regardless, your entire argument is semantic. The fact that there may be groups calling themselves feminist whose entire activism revolves around some single, unrelated concept does not change either the connection the writer's assertions have with feminist activism, nor do they change the fact that feminist *activism* defines what feminism is in and to society.

Because it seems like you are not doing anything scientific or statistical, but rather you've defined ""feminist"" as ""every woman who seeks special treatment,"" and thus tautological.

I think their is two things to say about this:

2. What do you mean, ""feed the golden goose""? What is it feminists (or women) have *not been doing, that would normally justify the differential in labor between men and women?

You are mistaken. It isn't that I or anybody favors stagnating wages. Rather, it is simply that we do not countenance government intercession in the market, ever.

Many people, both men and women, still believe a woman's place is at home with her children. Those gender roles have not disappeared completely for men or women. 

So to imply that women are totally free to go in either line where men are forced by society to simply have cake is dishonest. Because those things are changing and a man CAN make his choice. He will face ridicule from some, but he absolutely does have the choice to go in any line he wants. It is not ""Cake or death?"", if you will. 

And the analogy also has problems when it begins blaming feminists for keeping men in their line. The fact that men are more free to be stay at home dads is in part thanks to the feminist narrative that women are not the only qualified caretakers of the children and home. If you have any evidence that it's a common feminist belief that men shouldn't have the right to ""the whole buffet"" I'd like to see it.

Moving on - yes people have a choice at family planning. Life doesn't always work like that. When my wife went off contraception after our first, the Dr said ""Well. Wait for about 6 months for your cycle to go back to normal, then about 6 months after that you can start trying for your second."" I swear, she was pregnant within a fortnight.

Family planning is an imprecise business.

And, once planned, it doesn't mean you're not going to be made redundant in your job once or, like me, twice (in two years). Maybe your partner takes longer to finish her degree than planned and discovers a medical issue which prevents her from practicing her chosen profession so your plan for how to fund the children goes out the window. If it's too late to change your mind at 6 months pregnant, it's absolutely too late to change your mind at 6 years old.

The point is that people who choose to not abort are basically making a guess at what their life is going to be like in 10 year's time when the crunch of child rearing is at its hardest. Did you know at 20 (realistically) what your life would look like at 30? I'm 34, and I honestly have never considered what I'll be like at 44.

Almost, but I can't give you any points this time because you missed the most important parts.

My arguement was that *you* don't know what these things mean. I gave the example of *hegemonic masculinity:*

>When feminists like myself use these terms (though I don't believe I use ""toxic masculinity"") we are talking about things that can't be just gleaned from etymology. Selecting just ""hegemonic masculinity,"" I will show how feminists are actually working against common sense ideas of gender and masculinity that the author seems to believe feminists are working to maintain. This term was introduced by R.W. Connell, and in her work The Social Organization of Masculinity, she introduces how to conceptualize masculinity as an object of study like this:

>>... 'Masculinity' is not a coherent object about which a generalizing science can be produced. Yet we can have coherent knowledge about the issues raised in these attempts. If we broaden the angle of vision, we can see masculinity, not as an isolated object, but as an aspect of a larger structure.

>This demands an account of the larger structure and how masculinities are located in it. The task of this chapter is to set out a framework based on contemporary analysis of gender relations. This framework will provide a way of distinguishing types of masculinity, and of understanding the dynamics of change.

>You see, the key here is that the concept of ""hegemonic masculinity"" depends first on gender theorists to conceptualize masculinity as masculinities, a plurality of types of masculinity. Second, these masculinities (and subsequently hegemonic masculinity) are located in and constituting social structures.

>Which brings me to my last point, the concept of masculinities (and by extension, hegemonic masculinity) goes beyond the commons sense notion that their is simply masculinity which is collapsed into common sense ideas of being a man and being male. Rather gender theorists like Connell, go far beyond this. Just to give you a taste:

>>I define[d] gender practice as onto-formative, as constituting reality, and it is a crucial point of this idea that social reality is dynamic in time...

>>We are all engaged in constructing a world of gender relations. How it is made, what strategies different groups pursue, and with what effects, are political questions. Men no more than women are chained to the gender patterns they have inherited. Men too can make political choices for a new world of gender relations. Yet those choice are always made in concrete social circumstances, which limit what can be attempted; and the outcomes are not easily controlled.

>**What I mean by presenting this last piece of Connell's work is to show how by going beyond common sense notions of masculinity, not only has Connell made apparent the multiplicity of masculinity, but also that men are constituted and constitute the dynamic gender order. In this way, men are not villains. This is counter to the assertions made by this author, and in this regard, I think I have made a case against their thesis.**

You see, you don't understand that there are multiple *kinds of masculinity* of which we use the term ""masculinit**ies**"" to describe. A part of this ""multiplicity of masculinity"" is that meaning has become fractured and multiplied, and thus when the author (you) make claims that feminists think *all masculinity* is harmful and bad, you are dead wrong.

----

And now you care why *I don't think her argument is very feminist.* I will be using a Marxist feminist critique. This author's problems are highly contextualized by her racial and class privilege. You see, there are women (and men) who don't get a choice to turn down a 60-hour a week job in favor of spending more time with their children. Rather, there are disadvantaged men and women who *must* work a 60-hour a week job (or jobs), with no benefits, and with no security. These people *don't get a choice* to spend time with their children, and as a consequence miss out on life-opportunities that are normally afforded to white, upper-class, bourgeois women like the women in this article. The concern that this woman has are concern *you can only have* when soaked in as much privilege as she is.

This author, Sheryl Sandberg, and Christina Hoff Sommers are the worst types (the later two being liberal and libertarian feminists) because they are only concerned with equality up until the point they have achieved themselves. Then it's up to everyone else to ""pull themselves up by their own bra/boot straps."" It's such a petty and elitist concern, one which I don't share.",spermjack_attack,t2_asaqt,0,0,reddit3

No one continue to give fucks about that person, but because (probably male) he is antisocial/fucked up, he won't be a useful member of society. He might have all kinds of deficits, might be inclined to drug abuse, to criminal behaviour. Now this fucked up kid#3 robs you in the streets and shoots you in the face, because he doesn't give a single fuck about a society, that doesn't give a fuck about him. Well. Not your responsibility, but certainly your problem. People might be responsible for things, but don't neccessarily live up to that responsibility, thus creating problems for others. 

You pay for his failed socialisation one way or the other. Pay money to educate that person into a good, useful member of society or pay for the damages he/she might inflict on others and prison afterwards. Or do you have a solution for fixing that problem, without paying money for it? I'd say giving good people more room to be good parents might help to fix at least some of these problems. And it's free for you! 

You are free to think what you want to think. I prefer a society that *does* give a fuck about it's members. We should have moved on from survival of the fittest! I'd rather pay taxes for good schools than for prisons.

Just because you don't care about people around you doesn't mean the (potential) connections between them and you disappear. You still live in the same world and might meet each other, one way or another. It's in your interest too, to have good people around you.

It's only a problem if you are expected to work 60 hours+ and have no say in that besides...staying unemployed. Right now you only got the option of saying yes or no. I'd like to see a working enviroment where I could say ""Yes, but only 45hours and free weekends!"" and not be treated like a total idiot for that statement.

I absolutely understand why you would want that. The question is, why are you entitled to it? If you are working 45 hours a week, and I am working 75 hours a week, surely I should be paid more (assuming we work in the same position, for the same employer, in the same market). I assume even you would concede that. So, when it comes time to fill a senior opening, why should I not be promoted over you, assuming we are otherwise roughly equally qualified? I have put in considerably more work. Why does that not deserve consideration?

> You talk about your rights? If I had a kid, taking time off after childbirth would be seen as being super weird, since I'm a guy. If I were a women that would be totally fine and normal here. How is that not unfair? Same thing for working time: If no one starts complaining about it, nothing will change. It's really simple as that. I want more options, not less.

None of what you are discussing is a rights issue per se. The only way in which it might arguably be one is if you live in a country that ensures maternity leave without doing the same for paternity leave. Even then, I would argue that government has fabricated a right for the woman at the expense of the rights of her employer, and the fact that this fabricated right has not been extended to you is no great atrocity. Government should never insure maternity or paternity leave for any duration of time. Companies, of their own volition, should assure some limited form of both for their skilled employees, so that they can compete in the market. It seems as though your employer did that, but you are bitter about the seeming stigma of exercising an option they made available to you. To which I say, too damn bad. They already made an effort to accommodate you, and asking for any more is unreasonable.

>mostly boils down to the idea of treating women's experiences, desires, and feelings as of paramount importance, and that men's rights, freedoms, and lives, and very often also children's welfare should all be modified or even sacrificed for the benefit of women. The advocacy of feminist groups demonstrates that on a regular basis.

It looks to me like you chose to reply to the individual who was easier for you to talk to, not because the reply was more ""worthy of your response"" (a rather egotistical statement) but because my response demonstrated that you either didn't understand the blog post you were criticizing, or you were being deliberately obtuse, and following your usual pattern of attempting to focus the discussion on minute points (a few out of context quotes and a single term) rather than deal with the subject matter. You're queen of the semantic argument, but not much for dealing in honesty or forthrightness.

That's funny, because even in your own comment, *you* quoted me as using the word ""mostly."" Of course, I realize that as a post-structuralist, you might not understand the difference between the term ""mostly"" and the term ""all.""    
    
On a side note - name the branches of feminism which reject feminist theory - especially Patriarchy theory. Then tell me how many legs a dog has if you call a tail a leg. Yes, the two concepts are related. Yes, you've tried this argument before, and yes, I've pointed your error out in this way before. You are starting to sound like a broken record.     
    
> Except now you're saying that this is only the case if the feminism we are talking about is liberal and libertarian feminism    
    
No, I haven't said that. *You* said that, by presuming that advocacy, the goal of which is to garner privilege for women at the expense or to the detriment of men and children, is only found among those groups. The reality is that mainstream, active, having-an-effect-on-the-world feminism does exactly what I've stated. As far as your personal brand of feminism goes, it doesn't matter if you shit rainbows and fart butterflies - if you're not of the segment of feminism that influences government and other organizational policy, you're not representative of the movement. It would be different if you argued this when feminism was a new thing, and there was no feminist establishment. Because there is an entrenched, well-funded and *powerful* feminist establishment, and because it's been around for over a century, the act of defining anything you want to associate with women as ""feminism"" simply because you like the name is meaningless. In doing that, these fringe groups are to feminism what ""posers"" are to every trend that has ever followed an innovation in music, extreme sports, or alternative religion.

even more so, because it shows that you do not get what the argument is; that being that feminists who argue that X-behavior of mainstream feminists, or Y-aspect of mainstream or historic feminist advocacy isn't feminism ""because NAFALT"" are being intellectually dishonest by attempting to use ""Red isn't red because pink has white in it, and some white doesn't have any red in it *at all*"" as an argument, just as you have done here.

I agree with this TBH. My gf gets bad periods and always has to take leave for it. That said, not all women have it so bad they need the day off, and they'll now get an additional 12 days leave compared to their male co-workers, which is quite a lot (most places dont even have that much sick leave or annual leave). 

Also my problem with the thinking ""accept the biological differences"" is that it is not applied consistently. For example - feminists demand equal pay and other outcomes like 50% of executives or the board be women, after they cut their career short to be mothers (or now take period leave). So ignoring the fact men are biologically wired to work more and pursue higher job titles.

  Or demanding 50% of engineers/tech workers be women, completely ignoring the fact men are more likely to enter these jobs from a biological standpoint (men are more likely to be builders, creators, tinkerers).

But studies have shown men have a cycle, per month where their emotions hit them more and they are less productive. Why not just give each employee one more holiday? Would it be so very bad? 

This move is sexist af. Not because it benefits women (periods aren't really a convenience), but it assumes men are machines. Payment for a day counts, it's somewhere around 12hrs per day more that men have to put in, and get no thanks for it.

Exactly. I had maybe one day last year where I experienced deliberating pain at work to the point I had to ask my employer to go to the pharmacy across the street and get some some painkillers. I took the painkillers, sat down in the office for 20 minutes and I was good to work again. 

If the day off a month was paid I'd probably take leave regardless of having my period or not, cause who doesn't want to get paid for not doing work? However, if the day off a month is an unpaid day, I probably wouldn't take it more than needed.

Additionally, like any other policy, the assumption would be that you take it when necessary. I'm guessing that a major concern would be that a woman takes this leave when it is unnecessary or she is not on her period; however this would also mean if she did end up having a painful period she would've used her time (depending on how this policy works ).


By the way, since when are we in the habit of taking companies for face value? How much do we really know about this policy? Is it ""you have 3 days leave for a painful cycle!"" or ""you have three days leave -- with a doctor's note every time of course?'.

One thing I do agree with is that this policy unfoundedly assumes that all women have painful periods; that's not true, and it may become stigmatised to take leave on that basis.

With all that said, why are we criticizing this policy on the basis of ""unfairness"", instead of advocating for more conditions to be included in this policy? And why are we assuming that no sick leave existed, at all, until they introduced this policy? If they're going this far, they obviously either have a majority female employee base, or are particularly progressive.

No they aren't. The day off is explicitly only for women and transgender persons, regardless if they experience period. There are no special day offs for other conditions as far as I'm aware. 

>And 'transgender' probably refers to female to male transgenders 

The policy expressively stated all women and transgender employees. 

>Additionally, like any other policy, the assumption would be that you take it when necessary. I'm guessing that a major concern would be that a woman takes this leave when it is unnecessary or she is not on her period; 

As far as I know, female employees are not required to prove that they're on their period in order to apply for this leave. This is in line with some organisations that provide similar schemes. 

>By the way, since when are we in the habit of taking companies for face value? How much do we really know about this policy? Is it ""you have 3 days leave for a painful cycle!"" or ""you have three days leave -- with a doctor's note every time of course?'.

It's one day per month. I do not think a doctor's note is required as it is not categorised as a variant of sick leave. 

>With all that said, why are we criticizing this policy on the basis of ""unfairness"", instead of advocating for more conditions to be included in this policy? 

Because it's objectively unfair and recognising its unfairness and advocating for more conditions to be included aren't mutually exclusive. There has been some progress for Flipkart where they increase paid paternity leave from 10 to 15 days. That's a good sign but it's trivial when compared to their paid maternity leave scheme, which stands at 6 months with full pay. Mothers also have the option to choose 4 months of flexible work arrangement with full pay (3 months for fathers with no guarantee of full pay) and 1 year (only 3 months for fathers) of unpaid leave. The most blatant discrimination (other than the one in OP's topic) is that adoptive mothers (who do not experience postpartum recovery) get 6 months of paid leave whilst adoptive fathers only get 6 weeks, regardless of extent of caregiving. 

>And why are we assuming that no sick leave existed, at all, until they introduced this policy? If they're going this far, they obviously either have a majority female employee base, or are particularly progressive. I just find this all this outrage ridiculous and out of place, when there's more to be concerned with. 

All employees of Flipkart get 20 days of annual leave, 12 days of sick leave, 2 days of optional holidays and 1 day of special leave. They also get 5 days of marriage leave and unlimited bereavement (compassionate) leave. The introduction of this scheme effectively means female and transgender employees get 13 days of special leave, compared to the 1 day male employees get. 

Flipkart employs around 42145 employees. According to my knowledge, most technicians and delivery personnel are men, so no, I do not believe they have a substantially larger female employee base, not that it should matter anyway.",Solid-Perspective98,t2_8i5ikeia,1,0,reddit4

All humans start with having a monthly hormone cycle function (I believe it’s hypothalamus that does it). in the uterus for those that get the androgen production signal (from SRY gene, commonly on Y chromosome), that cycle function turns off since testosterone production in males follows a daily cycle rather than monthly. 

The hypothesis around why taking estrogen as hrt for transgender women brings back a sort of monthly cyclical pattern is because that hypothalamus function like reactivates. 

cramps, sore breasts, mood swings (what we typically attribute as PMS). Some can like tell when they period week is supposed to be. It’s not for everyone but it has been documented by some.

Actually, No. Equity is best defined as this- 

[https://medium.com/@eec/this-equity-picture-is-actually-white-supremacy-at-work-59f4ea700509](https://medium.com/@eec/this-equity-picture-is-actually-white-supremacy-at-work-59f4ea700509)

And I never saw this as a part of the ""feminist propaganda"".

There are things that I agree with on both sides and there are things on which I disagree with both sides. That does not say that I am tilted/with one side completely. 

In fact, my take on the whole gender issue is this-

If you look at the picture that I have linked above, you will see that one person has advantage and still is being given the same opportunity as the other, when they don't even need it.

I think that is the case on both sides. There are things and laws that women don't need but still they are being given more and also, there are things that men desperately require to achieve equal status in the society but they are STILL being denied those things. But, please understand when I say this, that this does NOT mean that there aren't things that women are disadvantaged at too, just like MEN are Disadvantaged in certain aspects of life!!! Both sides have certain disadvantages where they require some support to maintain equity!!! And while the feminists (the more public ones in my opinion) are only interested in gaining the required support for women, the MRAs (some of them, NOT the majority of them) are interested in gaining the required support for men. Notice that the ratio of people on both sides working ""only"" for the specific gender is different (for feminists, there is a majority like that: and for MRAs, there is minority for that- the rest of the members in both groups are striving for true equity, but sadly the disparity and disagreement between the two groups has not been able to help them achieve the said purpose).

As we know that a lot of ""feminazis"" have always fought for even more and more rights for women even though it may require them to Step on Men's rights to achieve it. They think- ""Hey!! How come Men get to do that!!!! We also want to do that!!!"" - even though the task at hand is something that they don't have a need to do. And that is exactly where we criticize them and distance ourselves from them. But doing the same thing that they are doing just makes us as petty as them!!

I never faced any criticism for my views on this subreddit before and I have always provided with gender-neutral views on anything. This is the first time that my gender neutral view has been soo criticized even though I am not completely disagreeing with you. I have my own opinion which I have formed after having seen both sides' point of view and I think I am happy with my opinion, even if other people may find it to be ""feminist propaganda""- which it isn't. 

I don't think that we should criticize giving them a day off, because periods can be a lot painful for some women. I always thought that a thing like this would always be appreciated in this subreddit because I have seen people in this subreddit being supportive to both genders, not just one, and that is what made me like this subreddit more, But alas, there will always be some people who will always see things from only one side of things and not both sides.

In procreation contexts it means what gametes one produces. female/male is a designation for plants too for example. if we are talking about procreation contexts for humans if can be done but we need to remember that is a very narrow section of human sexuality so isn’t absolute truth. it looks at a human from the perspective of just intercourse for procreation, assuming heterosexual and only having sex for procreation. 

In more society based contexts “female” is a phenotypic sex designation usually, so genitalia shape. That is how the F or M gender marker is assigned. When there is an intersex infant that has a penis that is considered too small for the doctor’s liking, they can perform surgery to turn the infant “female”. Even if it could have XY chromosomes and gonads were supposed to be producing sperm. (yes this is very common for intersex infants who have a penis too small for our society’s definition of male so they mutilate it for the sole reason of fitting into the sex dyad) 

woman is a gender identity and is not synonymous with female.

that average is not indicative of an individual man. grouping by gender isn’t useful in this case when the premise is you want larger and more stronger people to be accounted. There can be women and non-binary and intersex and female and whatever designation of human you want to be put there since it’s not all men or male humans. The premise is to consider humans that are in the larger and stronger end of the spectrum, which isn’t gendered. 

When you gender things it creates a lot of problems. Such as gendering sexual assault. Right now it’s marketed as a woman problem so men have to fight to get it acknowledged for them too. or we could have just not gendered it and it would have eliminated a lot of issues and people would have actually started to understand how sexual assault works. 

not all human female menstruate. women is a gender identity. if you don’t want to be transphobic and want to understand the full complexity around how people work you need to separate female and woman. because really those are different things. woman as human female is a very simplistic definition for those that don’t study human sexuality as a science.

Man and woman is not genetics. Notice how neither are the stereotypes you used are genetics. 

Man and woman are now words to describe gender identities that are on a spectrum. Just like non-binary. Eventually those labels will drop since they keep growing. You have bigender, agender, genderfluid, genderqueer too. Usually when terms keep growing it’s because we are working on a spectrum but people don’t see it this way yet. Sexuality is a spectrum so labels will keep growing until people realize you can’t label every variation and there is no point. So people will just be allowed to date/have sex with whoever they feel like without labeling it. it is difficult to label human experiences into neat boxes. 

Like right now the terms “trans masculine” or “presenting femme” are getting used. Instead of gender identity like man or woman. 

A more higher approach to think of it is forget everything you know about gender. Stop gendering everything like bathrooms, pronouns, clothes, sleeping areas. Stop assuming things about people based off their body parts. You now are left with just humans with various genitals shape, various hormones, expressing themselves as they wish, dressing how they wish, no laws restricting anything by gender or genitals or bodily function. If someone wishes to adjust their gender expression with hormones or surgery then that is easily given to them. 

A world where the concept of gender becomes irrelevant is called gender inclusive which is what we are moving to. It is in essence the point of real feminism. Gender equity. Such that the concept of gender becomes as irrelevant as eye colour. It is possible to design systems such that body parts, hormones, gender expression, gender identity etc. doesn’t impact any part of a person’s life. 

Tip: you won’t see what I mean if you keep thinking in binary gender and that sex = gender. you won’t get it trying to rearrange two blocks. You need to throw out the 2 blocks and think higher.

So I know that kind of pain where fetal position is the only thing you want to be. I mean, I had luck - it got so worse I lost feelings in my legs, called an ambulance and then it was discovered that it wasn't just some muscle-pain but... 2 herniated discs and got treated accordingly. But with menstruation... if it's so extreme that you cry because the pain can be soooo much and it happens every month: Isn't there anything you can do against it?

Sometimes one side is completely right and one is isn’t and sometimes there’s good points on both sides.

I personally think that equity is a bad policy on principle, if you’re constantly adjusting the taps on the quantity of benefits that are given to a group of people in order to make their experiences of hardship equal, you have to either use identity to discriminately apply the benefits or get really invasive about an employees personal business, both of which already have legal restrictions on them for good reason.

Even when talking about equity, there are some women who experience a low to moderate amount of pain and some who experience massive pain. It wasn’t equal to begin with. I’m sure women with pcos might need more than a day some months. It’s going to feel unfair to the woman that has to lay in bed for two days, taking an extra day off, compared to a woman who gets basically an extra vacation day.

Either every disease, condition, and issue is treated with the highest priority, or none of them are. You don’t get to decide what affects someone, to some women their mental health might be way more painful than periods. Why is that not being prioritized? This creates a system that’s chooses what ailments are worthy of sympathy.

I’m not saying pure equality is fair, it’s clearly not. Life isn’t fair to begin with. But it doesn’t create an artificial unfairness like equity does. If the least privilege person is given enough resources to succeed, it shouldn’t matter that the most privileged person is also given the same.

If you have some sexual orientation it has nothing to do with whether you are man or woman.

It's biology not psychology or social studies.

Definition of women is human female and definition of men is human male.

If you want to change definitions to fit your views then you are destroying the language. It's like this is the only true God.

Plus gender at first was to categorize things in genders.

There is a reason why in different languages they don't use translation for gender but go with the English word.

A lot of languages they have three genders masculine, feminine and neutral. For example Germany has Der die das.

English was gendered once too and you have up on that.

Now if you want to go by gender stereotypes. Like okay this woman doesn't fit the stereotype of a woman so it is a man is really weird.

And then once again how would you make sure the person is menstruating.

And even in sexual assault it is good to specify the gender. For example woman is more likely to be SA by a man and vice versa.

And even if it wouldn't be gendered it will be men perpetrator women victim.

Like in all the articles about women being raped in military. Yes tragedy but why it never stated who raped them. In cases of men it states that it is done by other men. In women cases where they are victims nothing. Nothing about the perpetrator. So people will go to default it is men.

That is the point you need the gendered language because there are differences.

The other way to approach this - and this is what society currently wants - is to go full equality. The catch is that this only applies to women.

Definition of woman being human female and definition of man being human male is your definition in context of I guess refusing to acknowledge that not everyone is cisgender? “Female” can mean “produces ova gametes” which apples to plants too. It can also mean a certain genitalia shape like for humans it’s vulva, “female” for humans is more about genital shape because that is how F or M is given on birth certificates. 

It’s not destroying language. It is adding more definitions to account for more complex concepts. we can call heterosexual normal and everyone else disorder, because we used to think that.

what’s the reason for making women have periods when they don’t want them?

Transgender men can ask to not have periods because they cause gender dysphoria. Anyone else regardless of gender identity can ask to not have periods, they aren’t necessary. Because there are currently methods to stop them by taking birth control non-stop. The placebo week is not mandatory. It was there to give periods so people verify they are not pregnant. If skipped then it can have the period not come ever while taking regularly. 

Taking Depo Provera, a shot every 3 months, and having IUD which is in the uterus for 5 years before changed also has the effect of stopping periods. There is no placebo week with Depo Provera or IUD. 

There is also the Naxplenon implant that is birth control but can stop periods. There is no placebo week either. 

I don’t see what’s the point of forcing people to have periods.

Sometimes science asks the wrong questions. 

Majority vs minority is actually what leads to these “oppressions” you guys hate talking about here. If we go off that majority is right handed and build the world around that, left handed will be oppressed. They get less “privilege” sort to speak. Like having to buy different scissors, being forced to use a right handed weapon or experience the shell casing go in their face, having to adapt to computers like switching the mouse location, hoping that in a setting with those chairs with a table attached there is one for left handed people, learning to write in a direction that may be less intuitive than for right handed and having writing smudge.

If you stop breathing, you die. If you stop periods with birth control or surgery, nothing changes. 

Yes transgender men can take hormone blockers. Not all need them, some just add more hormones. And they can transition yes. If transgender men can opt out of periods, anyone else can. There is no point of gatekeeping gender identities. If a cisgender woman doesn’t want periods, they don’t need to have it. 

It takes the right amount of hormones to stop a body function, yes. Just like taking insuline for diabetes. Or taking anti-allergy medication to not have a reaction. It involves taking external substance to achieve the goal. Which in this case is stopping periods. It’s not too much or too little, it’s the right amount required to achieve the goal.  

Nothing wrong with skipping placebo week. I already told you, Depo Provera, IUD, Naxplenon as a birth control method does not have a placebo week. So it’s a constant release of same hormones. It keep the body in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. 
Having less menstrual cycles leads to a lower risk of reproductive organs cancer. Because the fluctuating hormones cause wearing out. There has been studies done that those that were on birth control more of their life or were pregnant for more parts of their life so had less cycles and less of those hormone fluctuations (since birth control keeps same hormone level and being pregnant stops period) has lower risk of cancer in those reproductive organs. 

Then your mom was using a method that didn’t work for her. She should have went and asked for a different method or had the dosage adjusted. The Mirena IUD has the highest dose so is best for stopping periods. 

Naxplenon works for some and not for others. good to ask a gynaecologist and have them try all the options and dosages.

lol what. In Canada yes people can ask to have a hysterectomy.

You know that taking insulin when you have diabetes is to add what the body doesn't produce normaly, with birth control you are adding extra hormones not replacing them?

Birth control is not to stop periods, is to avoid the creation of a fetus. That is the goal with birth control .

You cannot skip placebo week without consequences. Those methods you name have a different way of ""placebo"" week because the ingest of the hormone is different. There hasn't been any actual studies that show that is safe to do.

People before puberty don’t menstruate, people after menopause don’t menstruate, people who are pregnant don’t menstruate. Nothing terrible happens to the uterus. 
The uterus builds and sheds the endometrial lining in response to hormones. like infants with a uterus can experience a mini periods after the hormone drop from being in the womb and getting mother’s hormones. 

I know very well in-depth every part of the menstrual cycle. Gynaecologists know it is unnecessary if someone doesn’t want it. 

The hormones don’t mess with the body. They do what they are supposed to. Seems by your definition taking pain killers for a headache is also “messing with the body”

Birth control non-stop keeps the body from ovulating and along with this effect the endometrial lining doesn’t end up building up or shedding with a hormone drop. A small amount of the endometrial lining must stay to keep the capillaries closed (it bleeds because it’s like a wound, endometrial layer flakes off due to hormone drop so until a new layer builds on top the exposed capillaries have blood come out). If there is no cycling of hormones due to the constant birth control then the endometrial lining stays thin and intact. that’s all. 

Lot’s of people go on birth control to stop periods. 

lmao did you just claim that stopping periods will have a woman die???
Tell me again why that is, I missed this explanation. 

Trans men need hormone blockers only if they start transitioning pre-puberty. That stops the development of puberty we associate with women. They then need to take testosterone hrt to develop the puberty we associate with men. If the trans man went through the woman-associated puberty they just need to take testosterone to get the masculinizing effects. There isn’t like “cancelling out” for trans men that ovaries still produce estrogen. Trans women on the other hand do need hormone blockers at any stage (pre-puberty or post-puberty). Since testosterone effects can overpower feminizing hrt. [notice how since testosterone overpowers feminizing effects in transgender women taking estrogen, it is unnecessary to block estrogen in trans men. They just need the testosterone added on top]

Taking allergy medication or anything really is adding things to your body to get a desired effect. Birth control is no different. If a person wants the effect of not getting pregnant or stopping periods then this is what they need to take to achieve that goal. 

That’s the original way birth control was invented but today we use it for other things. Originally Viagara was for regulating blood pressure. Today it’s used for something else because we found more use for this invention. 

There are no consequences to skipping placebo well. There have been many studies done to show this is okay. where are you getting your information from? 

No lol. Tell me how an IUD has a “placebo week”. Tell me how Naxplenon has “placebo week”

Then your mom should go to a doctor that will give proper methods for her goal. If she was getting pain then that’s not the right method. 

How is stopping periods unsafe?

What’s the problem with the number of hysterectomy going down? Our birth control is free up to age 25 so maybe people are choosing that method to stop periods. Anyone can access transgender health care. Don’t want breasts? Say they are annoying and lowering your quality of life, and free mastectomy.

Before puberty the body is getting ready to menstruate. After menopause we stop because the body got rid of the ""eggs"". And during pregnancy the ""period blood"" is what helps the baby grow. There is a reason women have periods naturally.

By flowing the body with too many hormones without knowing the consequences.

>Taking allergy medication or anything really is adding things to your body to get a desired effect. Birth control is no different. If a person wants the effect of not getting pregnant or stopping periods then this is what they need to take to achieve that goal.

You are using a law for transgender people as if is valid for cisgender women. That is not how it works. Also long-term effects of hysterectomies: it can increase the risk of stroke, bone loss, heart attacks and urinary issues. Most hysterectomies are done to women above 35.

I was on depoprovera, the side effects were extreme for me. Depression, extreme anxiety to the point where I couldn't eat, painful acne that I couldn't get rid of no matter what and am still battling after being off of birth control, mood swings, irritability, constant headaches, constant bleeding, weight gain, extreme pain during sex, tearing and bleeding in my vagina, and complete lack sex drive which kind of defeats the point of being on birth control in the first place. I would bleed every two weeks for two weeks straight. I never had an irregularities in my period before. I switched for my physical and mental health.

I tried a different brand of bc pills, less side effects than Depo, but I still didn't feel like myself and it still made my life more difficult than necessary. 

I have been off birth control for a whole year now and I am finally in a good place, I can feel emotions again, I have a sex drive, my periods are regular and manageable, I'm not crying all the time, I'm back to my normal size, I feel good and life is really good for me. I'm not gonna go back on birth control just because some guy on the internet said I should to stop my periods (which bc doesn't even do for me in the first place actually just makes them worse). 

The point is, every person is different. SOME people are able to stop their period with bc and like it that way, but that IS NOT the case for every woman and it may be a good decision for some, but for others it's not what's in their best medical interest. And you cannot just ignore the adverse effects the medication does have in the body, it is a major hormone alteration and it's not as simple as you think it is.

It’s not too many hormones. It’s a certain amount that is needed to get the desired effect. It would be the same amount as what your body produces itself during the luteal phase. Anything more would not be useful so doctors can regulate that to be the amount.

I think everyone gets caught up in outrage loops, so they don't realize when they are being irrational and simply getting swept away by our feelings.

As a society we really need to step up more and help each other recognize when we are engaging in distorted thinking patterns, because these are unhealthy and unproductive.

https://positivepsychology.com/cognitive-distortions/

Men in this sub and women in feminist subs - for the most part - have been traumatized by either the opposite sex or because someone they care about has been traumatized by a toxic member of the opposite sex. This leads to distorted thinking patterns, and part of that pattern is an over-attribution of the negative to a group, when the reality is that it only takes 20% of a population to victimize 80% of a different population.",tomowudi,t2_t578n,9,0,reddit1

A lady was found in a forest burned alive the morning before class so the police had no idea what happened yet they couldn't even identify the body.

at class the girls were literally say ""this is why all me must die"" and other misandrist statements 

I silently looked at ever other boy in the class and it was clear all of them were thinking the same e thing but it was like their was a voce grip I'm the class preventing the males from talking.

I finally open my mouth to say first off we have no clue who killed her and secound even if it was a man that is no justification to say the kind of things you are saying that's highly sexist.

the response was more men are evil and women can't be sexist.

until of course my female teacher came along said literally the exact sane thing I just got done saying for all of the girls to shut up and think.

of course when I said it it didn't matter but when she said it all of a sudden she's enlightened.

it reminds me of how when ""red pill guys"" says tge hook up culture is bad for women their misogynistic.

That is is just logical. You would not have enough worker to enforce the law. On top of that, you would have no valuable money nor supplies to pay and motivate them. 

Yes, right now you cannot imagine being with a woman since you are not naturally attracted to them, but there is a difference between sexuality and sexual behaviour. A good example is how suddenly there is an increase of homosexual couple in prisons. No other gender, only one option. Another example is how sexual assault in prisons are just common especially cause it is barely to never punished, like if there was no law enforcement like in my example in my first comment. Except my example covers a whole country/world and not just a secluded place. Sex is not a primary need or desire? Then you would deny every major industry which profits out of the natural desire and all the prison relationships and or rapes (including women prison). What is a natural desire and without discussion is the desire for dominance. Which rape is primarly all-about. And in a country where there is no more laws and enforcement of those, people's brutality to satisfy their aforementioned desires will express itself. If it is so hard to believe that women will assault other women, look up the abuse rates of lesbian couples. This should prove my point. And this is what happens in peaceful countries with stability.

I really won't get much into the ""pointing fingers at the other gender"" arguments. But to just give you some counter-arguments: I am afraid I will be accuse of assault because a woman is with me in the elevator. I am afraid I will accused a pervert because I accidentally looked into the direction of a female colleague. I am afraid people will think I am a pedo because I go out with my niece or because I carry her home.  I am afraid people will accuse me of being a ""toxic man"" just because I give them a stern look for once. All of those fears and more are there because people judge me and my entire gender due a minority which is not even close to the majority of ""us"" doing those said crimes. All of that because ""we"" were forced to carry the sins of those that did shit 200 years ago. 0 of all men I and my wife know did any of these things you are afraid of. And I do not say it by any hyberbolic sense, I mean the coldhard fact that literally zero men we know ever did any assault on women especially. Your sexist stereotypes prove that I should be still afraid of being accused of nothing.

You wanna do any of the many many essential jobs. Then go for it. Every Western country is happy to do so. You are legally allowed to do any job and by all accords, any man would be glad if more workers, regardless of gender, would relief them of the daily back pain of their cracking bones. The truth is, most women do not want to even think to dirty their hands and not do an office job. Which is fine, as long as you don't hide it. Besides, you think that any of your current rights and I mean any, would not have been achieved when fathers, husbands, brothers, cousins etc. did never ever wanted their female acquintances that they care and love to have a good and fair life? Do you think ""we"" liked it that a bunch of fat and rich elites denied that? Keep believing that equal rights have not been achieved by equal amount of help. And keep believing that women are innocent of an crime. Even in a sytsem lf anarchy. You accuse us of ""blind rage"" yet here you are exploding on me in a theorotical scenario and give me a whole sexist paragraph when I was talking calm and rationally.

isyjiuv,t1_isy6sdm,2022-10-19 17:12:50,MensRights,"Can you become an electrician within 3 weeks with no training and just the internet? More than 90% of electricians are men. Same with sanitation workers, garbage men, and truck drivers. Even with actual teachers, it takes years to become a capable electrician. Without teachers, it would take much longer. Given that electricity and will go down  within the month, it will take much longer to become an electrician. That means Society would go without electricity for years even if they could learn to become an electrician somehow without accidentally shorting the entire power grid. Another thing is transportation. Without most of the people working on oil/gasoline refinement, and without truckers, after a month, just filling a car much less ships and planes would be basically impossible. Each continent would be completely isolated from each other. Even if the trucking part gets filled, it would also take years for anybody to learn how to work on oil rigs and refine gasoline. That skips the whole part of getting to the oil rigs. Even if they don't accidentally break the oil rig, it would take years to learn what to do and how to do it. Also, food. Around 70% of the farmers are men. so, most of the food you are dependent on is now gone. It takes years to learn to farm. Most mechanized farming equipment will not work anymore too, so the female farmers would be able to farm much lower areas and as such, food production would go down more than 70% again. More than 90% of construction workers are men too, so nobody will be able to fix the facilities that get destroyed. No sanitation workers means no clean water too. That job again, takes years to learn.

Summary: without men, even if women do learn to take up the jobs men have, the world will be without electricity, clean water, food, and gas for years. It would be a miracle if humanity could relearn everything without accidentally breaking stuff(shorting the power grid & breaking oil rigs). Before you argue ""those jobs would be easily filled"", You're right, they would easily be filled but that would be after 5 or more years of constant study and practice but would society still be standing at that point?

People exist within society, it’s disingenuous to ‘take them out’ of it for the sake of a point. Society influences people’s actions and behaviours, a reality your comment doesn’t necessarily give fair consideration to 

A lot of the problems you mentioned aren’t problems because women themselves aren’t making certain decisions, this would be an unfair oversimplification. rather, society itself deters men and women from making certain decisions, whilst encouraging others. It boils down to gender roles

to use some of your examples, women’s fashion has typically been steered towards aesthetics, and away from function. this isn’t the fault of women themselves, but rather a sexist society that places certain expectations / beauty standards on people. If people defer from this norm they risk ridicule or ‘othering’, and as such the majority will conform 

It’s all very easy ‘saying’ what men and women should be doing, but the reality is people will be drawn to norms and stereotypes because those norms and stereotypes are the least risky, more comforting / consistent ways to carry out your lives, as clearly demonstrated by say, the significant lack of men in primary education",-Soggy-Potato-,t2_rbmk0wd,-15,0,reddit2

jf3sj28,t1_jetn1xw,2023-04-05 21:19:25,MensRights,"i say historically because women haven’t always had an equal chance at education

Looking at the UK, it took up to the 1950’s for women to be universally awarded degrees, (early as 1878 if we look at the earliest example) 

and this isn’t touching on the social side if we look at gender stereotypes. Even up until relatively recently higher education was dominated by men, only now are we seeing women outperform men regarding university attendance / achieving degrees (and also in primary education)

these traditional gender norms encouraged women to prioritise things like childcare etc rather than a career. Alternatively, men were socialised into into this breadwinner role, and these gender stereotypes still influence how people choose to live today (evident in how still, women on average take on a majority of domestic / childcare related roles within the family 

so yes, historical education absolutely favoured men. And now, more recently, there’s been a ‘feminisation’ of education, with the pendulum swinging, but people are still influenced by these norms.

So to sort of simplify what i mean, the educational mechanisms now likely favour women in many areas. BUT, socially, women are still dissuaded from pursuing sectors such as STEM and Engineering because they are socialised away from them.

i’m explaining how society influences how people act and behave. It’s not ‘men pushing women out of roles’ as the comment I’m replying to says, rather it’s society dissuading women from pursuing certain paths in order to conform

and how blaming women for conforming to gender norms is inappropriate, because they are not at fault

the problem is not women themselves, it’s society, and as such the solution is not to blame individuals like women, but rather blame the wider structures, society. 

With this more appropriate understanding of what the problem is, it means as a whole we can actually tackle the real problem, the thing that perpetuates these harmful gender stereotypes, the outdated social norms

i think the problem is your own unrealistic expectations. People are products of their environments, they are heavily influenced by societal conditioning. This is what generates these averages and trends that we can see

it might help to do more research into conformity as a general theory? because i fear your being much too simplistic with how you’re viewing human behaviour, we are much more complex than you’re giving credit

Yes. I agree. It was a generalised statement. However, in this current climate, there are many single men & women who must independently work to pay their bills. The percentage of men is likely higher yes, due to women being more likely to be primary caregivers.

i don’t really know much but i’ve heard this idea of ‘productivity’ being thrown around. and how this tradition of working 9-5 isn’t best suited for the average person. people aren’t productive for the entire duration and some sort of work day reform definitely warrants discussion. 

although on the general point you’ve made, i would say you might be overestimating slightly how much impact this has? Or at least, being a bit too distracted by this facet of what work based implications ‘being a woman’ can bring. I view the primary influences on the gender wage-gap as being based around gender norms, relating to the type of profession / likelihood of working at all

I.e. women are more likely to work part time or not be a breadwinner due to the traditional gender norms of taking care of / raising the kids. Or in the same way, traditional gender norms incentivise often lower-paying professional sectors such as childcare, with the opposite being the case for men

although this is one of those things that’s changing, e.g. women are currently graduating university at higher rates, social trends demonstrate more women are working than they did in the past, dual-earner households are rising, as well as many choosing to prioritise work over family

but like, all i’m doing is explaining the gender-wage gap, im not comfortable with making some sort of statement to the solution, because right now i can’t quite see a ‘solution’ to the physiological differences men and women experience, all i can do is try and place it in its wider context to suggest maybe there are more significant dilemmas with simpler solutions to tackle first",-Soggy-Potato-,t2_rbmk0wd,1,0,reddit2

this is just an issue of being uninformed 

If we are raised in a culture that says for example, ‘boys don’t cry’, boys are likely to shy away from expressing their emotions. 

For me, i am not going to blame men for not showing their emotions, because i understand the reason why this behaviour is being exhibited, and how it’s a result of the society they were socialised in. if your whole life the world around you teaches you one thing is normal, the other is undesirable, people will conform to what is comfortable and safe, in turn avoiding ridicule or othering. I made this point before but idk if you didn’t understand it, this example should make more sense though.

I get you want to make it simple, but human behaviour is not simple, your way of understanding it is wholly unscientific and inappropriate. I recommend you look into some material concerning say, conformity. It’s a good psychological topic that would help address some of the inappropriate conclusions you’re drawing 

> No, the problem is you don't consider women people. Society is created by people. Their choices form the social norms you are complaining about. Women absolutely contribute to those norms by making individual choices. They are responsible for the results of those choices and the society that comes from them.

we are products of society, we maintain the norms and traditions passed down from previous generations 

and evidently, attitudes are improving, we are making positive progress. Just look at the steps made in virginity for example. Compared with previous generations, society is much more accepting and tolerant of a woman having sex before marriage. or of more acceptance around people having more active sex lives. This is progress, evidently there are still lingering influences from a more traditional time but these outdated ideas ARE being changed 

Totally reconstructing how we view certain topics within society does not have an individual solution, rather it is a collective and gradual change. The values surrounding sex *are* changing, it’s just slow, and made even slower by these embarrassing sexist analogies that act in opposition to progressive change 

> People having a tendency to conform does not remove their responsibility for their own actions. Especially in a liberal society where they aren't arrested or punished for it.

I agree there is some responsibility but i also can comprehend that that responsibility is not something to be used as a weapon in order to victim shame

we do not attack men for killing themselves because they don’t open up about their mental health. We know that men are discouraged from seeking emotional support due to sexist stereotypes of being ‘stoic leaders’ who ‘show no weakness’. Because of this knowledge, we are collectively and gradually, as a society, pushing for these outdated traditional views around ‘masculinity’ to change, in order to provide better support for men with mental health issues 

i think the main issue is you’re getting hung up on a single area of how gender stereotypes affect people. And this is creating a double standard. 

Ultimately, i think you’re arguing from a position of ignorance regarding conformity, and how that interacts with wider social structures / gender stereotypes. This is why you are blaming individuals for a wider structural problem, and failing to understand that changing these ingrained values takes time, and is not up to the individual, but rather down to slow collective change",-Soggy-Potato-,t2_rbmk0wd,1,0,reddit2

Management that are reliant on that director to do their jobs might consider complaining, but in every company I've worked for, if someone substantially above you was a bit of a wanker, you simply square your shoulders and do what it takes to get the job done.

The point isn't the truth in the accusations... that would be EFFORTLESS to prove, if someone was as bad as OP suggested they were, you could even ask the secretary at the front desk about the times they come and leave and get an accurate and unbiased picture. In a major company you might even have FOB swipes or security footage that could flawlessly articulate the time they come and leave... Everything that's important about OP's post is in HR's reaction to his reply, they didn't CARE that she was undermining the performance of the entire company, just like nobody cared that he was essentially performing the work of a director while the company wasted $130k a year on her salary.

The suffragettes were from **extreme** wealth married to senators, and CEOs of plantation/slave trade and mining companies that exploited men at the bottom. They (suffragettes) wanted to inherit that wealth from their dead husbands and inherit the companies like mining, gold, construction, shipping etc.... When they inherit this wealth the call it 'feminism' but don't share the money back to working class families in mining or share with Africa as it was accumulated from slavery/oppression.  They essentially knew exactly what they were doing.

Women at the bottom have not felt that benefit either as they inherit debt from their dead poor husbands or don't start off at the same level as privileged women. 

**To highlight this as an example:** We see the massive changes in education when girls go to university more and do better in education, but working-class women and racial minority women in no way whatsoever have gone through those same changes of flooding into universities. It is exclusively privileged, privately educated white girls who have gone through this change. Then we look at who feminists are; privileged, privately educated, white women. So their DAUGHTERS are the primary beneficiaries of their MOTHERS'/GRANDMOTHERS' activism while minority girls are not really involved. Minority mother can't correct this either because they don't hold the reigns in women's organizations, white women hold the control of how a programme is set up in school. You don't need to be a genius to see through it. Feminism is for women and girls at the top. **Another example** is women's employment networks. Rich white corporate women (feminists) drain hundreds of millions of men's taxes and set up a women's network which pulls in other rich well-connected white women (their girlfriends), while again minority women are very much uninvolved in any of this.

We could then ask why there's so many white, privileged females in feminism, women's studies, sociology etc..? and so little Asian/Black women or working class women in feminism? It becomes obvious why white females love it so much and minority women seem less likely to go into professional feminism. Most likely because they've less to gain from it. White females in their 20s/30s are in absolute adoration of feminism and are the most hostile to critiques of feminism, moreso than minority women. Because it's run and designed by themselves, benefits themselves, and caters to themselves. Why wouldn't white, privately educated females be most interested in feminist studies more than minority women; they absolutely love all of this.

jsrnl4o,t1_jsr0gr2,2023-07-20 19:10:16,MensRights,"Sorry for the wall of text below, but its kind of a complex topic. Basically /u/Current_Finding_4066 is saying that for most of history, most men weren't allowed to be financially independent either.

Most men were bound to the land that they had to farm for their lord. Who used the food produced to pay taxes to the king,  and to provide a certain number of equipped military troops and afford their own lifestyles.  Serfs were allowed to build a home on the land, and grow a small garden to ensure that they didn't starve but it wasn't allowed to interfere with the production quotas. Their personal grain was normally limited to a single acre, as that was just enough to avoid starvation of a small household while being small enough to only take a single day to plant and single day to harvest per year.

If you wished to leave your land for more than a couple days, you needed permission from the lord, Who would likely give your house to someone who was willing to farm it. Over time a few regulations to the practice were added that prevented the very worst abuses by the worst of the lords, but only because mismanagement that caused serfs to starve, ultimately hit the king's bottom line. there was an improvement after the black death, because there weren't enough men  left alive to farm all the land.

 Serfdom was a way to keep a slave class, while giving them responsibility for managing their own production. (similar to wage slavery in a company town)  Prior to Feudalism, Farm owners might have slaves, or hire day labor. but the farm owners were a sort of middle management class.  They would have had to pay the taxes and the like, but they were directly involved in the day to day running of the farm. it gave many of the laborers a slightly better life in comparison to slavery, or day labor, They would be allowed homes, wives and children, but completely gutted the local level economies by concentrating the wealth at the lord level because the land usage restrictions placed upon the serfs meant that they never had any spare money.  Skip a few meals a week for a year to save up for a new farm animal, and then you hit a rock with your plow and need to pay the blacksmith to fix it.  It was a level of poverty where things like metal sewing needles were a luxury, even though the technology had already existed for thousands of years.

Keep in mind that  between 1 in 7 and 1 in 14 men reproduced historically. Many women died in childbirth, so wealthy men who didn't work risky jobs would regularly have multiple wives throughout their life time. but in the medieval period  97% of men were kept low without education, and literally bound to their land by law and religion. Their lord was their lord, not only because it was his job, but also because God put him there to order his serfs around, and therefore only he could determine what rights you needed.

In classical times, slavery was extremely popular, and between 30-60% of the population of most states were slaves.  But that meant that a significant portion of the population had rights, and the potential to get grievances aired in court. Feudalism was a ""step forward"" for slaves while also eliminating the middle class. And that middle class generally wanted their slaves to at least be provisioned to work effectively. As with most businesses efficiency is key to profit. Slaves had an actual resale value, so  masters generally cared if their slaves were wasting away. Which meant that although their food wasn't generally high quality, it also was generally guaranteed to be sufficient for the work completed by the slave.

on the other hand if your serf couldn't produce anymore, and he didn't have a son old enough to take over,  a lord would simply kick them off the land and replace him with the second or third son of another serf who had managed to get lucky enough to keep his farm in good repair and feed his family better.

Feudalism is where we get the idea of peasantry from. before feudalism, most of the poorest weren't expected to be responsible to figure out where the next meal was coming from, or what needed to be done next.  By ceding that responsibility to the lowest classes without educating them, and designing a system that keeps the lower class competing with itself to tread water, Grift was maximized while keeping social mobility low, preserving the social order for the next generation of Nobles.

I shouldn't have to say this, but given that it is reddit:People should not be possessed by other people. Slavery is wrong, and evil. But the move from slavery to serfdom, is very similar to what we've seen over the last 50 years  in America with Small businesses having difficulty competing with mega-corporations, and how these corporations are hiring fewer Full time employees, and more contractors. Technically a contractor has more personal rights than a Full Time Employee,  (technically they can set their own start times, and choose their own health insurance, etc.) But in reality it works that it simply removes the responsibility of the corporation to ensure that you can live off your wages, and ensure that you have the health coverage you need to live well.

This is also similar to how Pensions were replaced with 401k.  previously, your employer was responsible to ensure that those who worked for them for decades could survive once they could no longer work. Now its the employee's responsibility, but without an increase in pay, and the rich are allowed to use the same tax dodge that makes a 401k based retirement remotely possible.",RemCogito,t2_4jukf,12,0,reddit4

Presumably because she now has to take care of the home AND take care of work - like everyone in the fucking world... and her frustrations are dead on. The current 5 day work week was fought for **IN BLOOD** by labor unions at the turn of the century. 

It was a trail blazing policy at the time but it is outmoded and suitable for a different time and different needs.

We live in a time when production has sky rocketed, but salaries and labor free days have remained relatively unchanged in comparison to the production people bring to companies and employers. Mainly due to technology, education and all sorts of other things. 

So what's my point? My point isn't that this is necessarily a labor rights issue - more specifically it isn't a women's rights issue. The reason I advocate that it could be a labor rights issue is that something like a 4 day work week could help alleviate the kind of exhaustion she's describing. Regarding the labor rights argument - my point is that this problem can be resolved through that lens... not removing women from the work place or lambasting the fight women made to have the right to work.",Hazzman,t2_dc7rj,3,0,reddit4

Free Market Socialism. Workers own the workplace. Capital starts from a large group of Cooperative Banks, which compete trying to fund successful enterprises. Coops prevent oligopolization, work ownership prevents capital accumulation in a few hands, company comes first before profits, workplace becomes more agreeable, no more pissing in a bottle or fear.",utopista114,t2_5g34425,1,0,reddit4

You're wrong. You have the definitions of capitalism and socialism wrong, which is not a coincidence. Oligarch peddlers have for decades obscured the meaning of these words.

Capitalism: CAPITAL owner takes profits due to being owner of the capital, not working. It's called CAPITAL-ism.

Socialism: the value created belongs to those that created it. In Coop Socialism, or Free Market Socialism, or many other flavors, this means the workers in each company.

When they say ""private property"" what they mean is ""private property of the means of production that give rights to profits without working"".",utopista114,t2_5g34425,1,0,reddit4

Nope. Not a one.

(Before anybody complains, I don't dispute that some women are very good at their jobs, high-ranking or otherwise, and that some women do aspire to be in those positions based on merit.

If we are going to put quotas on male dominated areas, then the reverse should also apply.  By the same logic female dominated fields should have female quotas.

Here's a quote from William Costello, somebody I've been listening to a lot recently:

> research shows that less than 5% of young women desire relationships with men who are unemployed or work part-time (Dernberger & Pepin, 2020)

So... of course, men could be homemakers or stay at home parents, thereby opening jobs for women (naturally, without the need for forced quotas to cram women into roles that are otherwise full), offering choice for men that women have but men often don't, and it could help rebalance the dating market too.

But apparently women don't care for that sort of thing, they don't like ""deadbeats"" who aren't ""bringing home the money"" (even if they too are making bank in their own jobs). We don't think that way about most women, do we? Especially if they choose to have children. No, we praise them as housewives and dedicated mothers. We actively provide them resources to be able to perform that role.

This! Their blatant hypocrisy is so fucking annoying as is the constant insult to our intelligence. How much longer are they gonna lie and say it's about equality when every move they make is to ensure female superiority?

Feminists wish to build a society where merit and personal ability don't matter. Where one sex gets given scholarships, financial aid, is hired and is promoted based off their gender alone while the other is repressed. They keep crowing on about their bullshit equality all while creating a society that is incredibly patronizing to women and favours them in every area. They want the power structure of a matriarchy while keeping the protections and benefits they obtain in a patriarchy by constantly portraying themselves as the victims that they no longer are.

>actually discriminated against until there weren't. Now that women vastly outnumber men? Well, it's just because women are better students. It couldn't possibly have anything to do with how we've stacked the system against men.

Lmaoooo exactly this! When it's more men than women it's never because of merit or ability but because of systematic discrimination but when it's more women than men, oh that's just merit based hiring. Give me a fucking break.

It is complicated and recently changed to pressure men into taking more leave. It used to be less for men and upto 3 for women. Now there's a system were both women and men get X amount of time and a party can give a portion of their time to the other party (can't remember if it was half or a third)

(Okay checked, so both get 160, days of full parental leave, and max 63 days can be given to the other partner, then after this period of time one can go to hoitovapaa ""caring leave"" which is different were one can be until the child turns 3 during these roughly two years the parent receives a government benefit, but no salary, this can be divided anyway the parents want, I didn't find the information on how it goes if the parens can't agree on it.)

So in theory yes, but I wouldn't necessarily call it equal since women are the ones who make the decision on reproduction, and men generally outearn their wives.

Women still do take way more parental leave than men for more or less obvious reasons

+ Women get 40 days of pregnancy leave which men do not get

ibj05s6,t1_ibiqngr,2022-06-07 20:10:29,MensRights,"Thanks for that, I appreciate it. When I said about Europe's track record, I wasn't talking about conscription at all. I was talking more about there's a precedent there of European countries when setting quotas to set them in such a way like: 30% must be women, 30% must be men, the remaining 40% can be either. I'm not even saying that all EU countries do it this way all the time, I don't know, but I have seen it done this way and I think it's the most sensible and fair, and I would be disappointed if they don't do it for this quota.
Conscription is a different argument, I don't think it's fair that men get drafted and women don't,  but luckily we don't have this practice in my country.",pumpkinpeopleunite,t2_jv43m0sm,2,0,reddit1

I live in Ireland. We don't have a draft, so women here don't get to vote without the responsibilities men have. Both men and women have the same rights and responsibilities as citizens, which is how it should be.

History says otherwise. Commonwealth (I know Ireland is not part of Commonwealth but it still applies) countries are especially disgusting and deceptive in their use of conscription. They have and will continue to (imo) use to   
male only conscription when are facing troop shortages in a war. This is specially disgusting since most of these men are not trained at all and are only there to serve as meat shields.

No it doesn't.  Ireland, as an independent country (Republic of Ireland) has only existed for about 100 years. We do not have a draft, end of story.



>Commonwealth (I know Ireland is not part of Commonwealth but it still applies)


What?! No it doesn't still apply. Laws of one country don't apply to other countries. I'll repeat: Ireland does not have a draft. Men here do not have any extra responsibilities as citizens than women do.

I don't give a flying fuck how conscription worked in the past or currently under British rule. I live in Ireland. We are no longer under British rule, and we don't have conscription here.

Since I don't live in the US, I wouldn't have a clue (although I'd hazard a guess that it's so that women's right to bodily autonomy won't be so easy to erode in the future as it seems to be right now) . But I hope you're going to enlighten me?",pumpkinpeopleunite,t2_jv43m0sm,0,0,reddit1

Called me uneducated.

Stop dishing it out if you can't take it. So fragile. So hypocritical.

>I don't give a flying fuck how conscription worked in the past or currently under British rule.

If you wilfully choose to be ignorant about history then don't argue about it and certainly don't call someone a uneducated.

Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it or something like that.

>although I'd hazard a guess that it's so that women's right to bodily autonomy won't be so easy to erode in the future as it seems to be right now

Same thing applies to conscription, nothing is stopping the legislators from creating a conscription law in the time of war.

And BTW a Supreme Court ruling is the next best thing to a constitutional amendment. Congress changes every 4 years, Supreme Court judges are for the lifetime. So it not ""so easy"" to abrogate RvW.

No I didn't. If you read it properly you'll see that I said you shouldn't argue about things you are uneducated about. Nobody is educated on everything, people who try to argue about things they are not educated about often make fools of themselves. That's in no way the same as calling you uneducated. 


I'm not going to respond to the rest of your comment because it's just more gibberish about something you don't fully understand. Maybe stick to arguing about US issues, because you seem to know about the US political system. You know next to nothing about Ireland. 


I'm just going to leave you with this thought, which is coming from a good place:  You are the definition of a pick me girl. I mean, not everyone on this sub is a misogynist, but there are many of them here, and you are aggressively defending them by attacking people like me who say anything other than ""women bad, men good"". Do you think they respect you for that? They respect you as much as they respect any woman, that would be zero. In fact, they are probably laughing at you, they don't have to respect you but you still do their dirty work for them. 


Now, please resist the urge you are probably feeling right now to attack me further, I won't be responding to you anymore,  this conversation is over. I'm just saying I think you should take a step back from this sub and consider why you feel the need to attack others online in defense of misogynists. What's in it for you? That's a rhetorical question, there's really no need to reply, as you won't get a response, just something for you to think about. 


 In the future when you've matured somewhat you will likely look back on some of the things you've said in this sub and cringe with embarrassment. Also, I really hope you never speak to people in real life the way you do here, it won't serve you well. I hope you will find it in yourself to calmly consider what I've said, and I wish you the best!",pumpkinpeopleunite,t2_jv43m0sm,0,0,reddit1
