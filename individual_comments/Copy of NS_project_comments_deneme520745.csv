That won't cause any problems, none at all; not causing men who are better qualified to resent women getting the job instead, or women being insecure about the fact that they aren't confident they got the job on merit or capability, or sending the message to the broader spectrum of men that if you have a vagina you get special VIP entry into top jobs that *most men don't even have*, or poor company performance because half of the board is just there to fill seats and collect cheques.

Nope. Not a one.

(Before anybody complains, I don't dispute that some women are very good at their jobs, high-ranking or otherwise, and that some women do aspire to be in those positions based on merit. But if you have 10 seats on the board, at most 6 of them can be male, let's say there's 2 really good female candidates. Who are you going to put in the remaining two seats? Who else is applying, and what qualifications, experience, or aspirations do they have?)",bottleblank,t2_652q8518,245,0,reddit2

What is also unfair is the one sided way proportionality is viewed.   It’s a title ix violation if slightly more men choose to go out for athletics, but no problem when aerobics, yoga, palates, etc are 95% female.   

It was a crisis that more men went into science, but not a problem that more women went into psychology, sociology, education, the arts, etc.  

If we are going to put quotas on male dominated areas, then the reverse should also apply.  By the same logic female dominated fields should have female quotas.    Hospitals should require 40% male nurses, schools 40% male teachers.   What about men vs women being able to stay at home and be supported by their partner?   Shouldn’t we put quotas on that?

Men and women make different choices, we shouldn’t be limiting peoples ability to choose because of their sex which is precisely what quotas do.

So... of course, men could be homemakers or stay at home parents, thereby opening jobs for women (naturally, without the need for forced quotas to cram women into roles that are otherwise full), offering choice for men that women have but men often don't, and it could help rebalance the dating market too.

But apparently women don't care for that sort of thing, they don't like ""deadbeats"" who aren't ""bringing home the money"" (even if they too are making bank in their own jobs). We don't think that way about most women, do we? Especially if they choose to have children. No, we praise them as housewives and dedicated mothers.

This! Their blatant hypocrisy is so fucking annoying as is the constant insult to our intelligence. How much longer are they gonna lie and say it's about equality when every move they make is to ensure female superiority?

Feminists wish to build a society where merit and personal ability don't matter. Where one sex gets given scholarships, financial aid, is hired and is promoted based off their gender alone while the other is repressed. They keep crowing on about their bullshit equality all while creating a society that is incredibly patronizing to women and favours them in every area. They want the power structure of a matriarchy while keeping the protections and benefits they obtain in a patriarchy by constantly portraying themselves as the victims that they no longer are.

>actually discriminated against until there weren't. Now that women vastly outnumber men? Well, it's just because women are better students. It couldn't possibly have anything to do with how we've stacked the system against men.

Lmaoooo exactly this! When it's more men than women it's never because of merit or ability but because of systematic discrimination but when it's more women than men, oh that's just merit based hiring. Give me a fucking break.

>Fuck these people, and the damage they've been allowed to do to society simply by abusing western civilization's built in compassion towards women. It's despicable the way they've abused that to get what they want.

It is complicated and recently changed to pressure men into taking more leave. It used to be less for men and upto 3 for women. Now there's a system were both women and men get X amount of time and a party can give a portion of their time to the other party (can't remember if it was half or a third)

(Okay checked, so both get 160, days of full parental leave, and max 63 days can be given to the other partner, then after this period of time one can go to hoitovapaa ""caring leave"" which is different were one can be until the child turns 3 during these roughly two years the parent receives a government benefit, but no salary, this can be divided anyway the parents want, I didn't find the information on how it goes if the parens can't agree on it.)

So in theory yes, but I wouldn't necessarily call it equal since women are the ones who make the decision on reproduction, and men generally outearn their wives.

Women still do take way more parental leave than men for more or less obvious reasons

+ Women get 40 days of pregnancy leave which men do not get

No it doesn't.  Ireland, as an independent country (Republic of Ireland) has only existed for about 100 years. We do not have a draft, end of story.

What?! No it doesn't still apply. Laws of one country don't apply to other countries. I'll repeat: Ireland does not have a draft. Men here do not have any extra responsibilities as citizens than women do.

If you wilfully choose to be ignorant about history then don't argue about it and certainly don't call someone a uneducated.

Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it or something like that.

>although I'd hazard a guess that it's so that women's right to bodily autonomy won't be so easy to erode in the future as it seems to be right now

Same thing applies to conscription, nothing is stopping the legislators from creating a conscription law in the time of war.

And BTW a Supreme Court ruling is the next best thing to a constitutional amendment. Congress changes every 4 years, Supreme Court judges are for the lifetime. So it not ""so easy"" to abrogate RvW.

No I didn't. If you read it properly you'll see that I said you shouldn't argue about things you are uneducated about. Nobody is educated on everything, people who try to argue about things they are not educated about often make fools of themselves. That's in no way the same as calling you uneducated. 


I'm not going to respond to the rest of your comment because it's just more gibberish about something you don't fully understand. Maybe stick to arguing about US issues, because you seem to know about the US political system. You know next to nothing about Ireland. 


I'm just going to leave you with this thought, which is coming from a good place:  You are the definition of a pick me girl. I mean, not everyone on this sub is a misogynist, but there are many of them here, and you are aggressively defending them by attacking people like me who say anything other than ""women bad, men good"". Do you think they respect you for that? They respect you as much as they respect any woman, that would be zero. In fact, they are probably laughing at you, they don't have to respect you but you still do their dirty work for them. 


Now, please resist the urge you are probably feeling right now to attack me further, I won't be responding to you anymore,  this conversation is over. I'm just saying I think you should take a step back from this sub and consider why you feel the need to attack others online in defense of misogynists. What's in it for you? That's a rhetorical question, there's really no need to reply, as you won't get a response, just something for you to think about. 


 In the future when you've matured somewhat you will likely look back on some of the things you've said in this sub and cringe with embarrassment.

Gentlemen, do not place your jobs on the line just to make a point. If you feel the need to take extra precautions around female coworkers, do just that—but do *not* announce it, at least not in such a brazen manner. That's just going to make it easy for feminists to target these strategies and cry sexism. 

No, this needs to be subtle and covert. It needs to come across as something men have to do in secret, because the deck is stacked so heavily against us. It needs to be something hard to nail down, so that awareness of it ebbs into the societal consciousness slowly. We don't want to appear aggressive here, this needs to be viewed as what it is: a defensive posture we're being forced to take. 

Personally, I don't feel the need to do this, and I don't encourage men to do it if they don't legitimately feel threatened. Maybe that's a mistake on my part, but if so, I'm sure I'll learn the hard way. I just think doing this as a form of protest is likely to backfire on us.

dr4hcto,t3_7j7fzt,2017-12-12 05:48:11,MensRights,"You're not supposed to announce your practice of the Billy Graham rule because, let's be real, it is indeed sexist. Just like women fearing all men as a potential rapist. But the reason the rule exists is for practical, safety-based reasons. The word of a woman is far heavier to the ears of people than the word of a man. Especially these days. Weighed against each other, people will sympathize with a woman over a man. A woman claims a man did something wrong to her, then he must have.

I experienced a false accusation and practice the rule to some extent. It is just smart after what I'd been through in a previous workplace. Everyone knew better than to believe her, but the company had to cover itself. She was fired for losing her temper constantly and damaging company property as well as arguing with customers. She was rehired when she claimed I groped her and two other coworkers berated her, causing her constant stress. HR moved my shift and gave hers back. I moved to a different company location instead, she got fired again and bizarrely claimed I was still harassing her at work but HR was fed up, I hadn't been on that particular location's security cameras since I moved employment. She stayed fired and will likely have a hard time working anywhere again. My boss from the other location gave me an apology afterwards, she was distraught that this kind of thing could threaten someone so much and how close I apparently was to being permanently black-balled or worse all for a lie even HR knew about. She was directly told by an HR representative that they knew this was all BS and they just wanted this all to blow over neatly and quickly.

Bottom line; sexual harassment is an easy way to get an entity that values its image to do things for you and against a man, whether you actually hate him or he is just an unfortunate pawn. Even a lame accusation like the one leveled against me is enough to make things happen. I keep to myself less, as it makes me a better target to have no social backing. Just a tip. I like people a little less for my experience, but I appreciate their occasional sense for judgement.

Practice the rule privately. Understand that if you have a false accusation against you, you still probably shouldn't talk about it. People don't care what you have to say, a woman said you did something wrong to her. Just be safe and be quiet, you don't have the privilege of being a victim whether something happened to you or not. Women? Women are victims by default.",GreyTortoise,t2_12kbki,63,0,reddit3

Could already be happening for all we know (and indeed is, in the case of eg feminist opposition to shared parenting, fair domestic violence policies etc.)   I mean it's not like any of these alleged acts of ""sexual misconduct"" have been proven in a court of law, and in some cases at least they seem to amount to ""this guy I find unattractive flirted with me at work.""  

A labor politician in the UK has already committed suicide over an unproven allegation.   The Orwellian term ""sexual misconduct"" is so broad it can mean practically anything.   

I'm starting to think the end result of this (ever escalating) feminist hysteria (whistling at a girl is now a ""hate crime"" in the UK) is going to be the return of sex segregation.   Already some men in the workplace are refusing to be alone with women; Japanese men are demanding their own train cars so they won't be falsely accused of groping; and the whole ""MGTOW"" thing seems to be growing like wildfire.   

I'm also starting to wonder whether female complaints about unwanted male attention are the whole reason ""patriarchy"" was established in the first place -- or at least certain elements of it.   What feminists are demanding -- eg that ""unwanted speech"" be classified as a crime in France -- is really an expansion of traditional gender roles, not a repudiation of them.   It's just that feminists want the entire state to act as a gigantic chaperone (and enforcer, and provider) rather than individual men.   Jordan Peterson has even argued that we are entering a new era of female totalitarianism.   

One of the problems with a potential matriarchy (are we already [living](http://www.realsexism.com/) in one?) is that women have in group bias, whereas men do not.   There appears to be a very large empathy gap that may be instinctual in nature.   This is dangerous stuff, because whereas females have all sorts of privileges under patriarchy (women and children first etc.) there is no reason to suspect that males will be granted a counter-balancing set of privileges under matriarchy.   

Indeed Karen Straughan has argued that under patriarchy it is ""women and children first"" off the lifeboats; under a matriarchy it will be ""women, children and the women's luggage first.""  ",audiotraxx,t2_nwu262y,32,0,reddit3

And yes, I do think this man is being an idiot. He's deliberately provoking women on a very serious issue for them in a way that suggests he's not taking it seriously at all. 

That the response to the prevalence of workplace sexual harassment of women by men is a gross overreaction does not negate the fact that many women have suffered this crap for a long time. Our response needs to be commensurate with that overreaction, not an overreaction itself. To the extent that men do feel unsafe around female employees, they absolutely should take precautions, and if that affects women's career prospects...well, that's their problem. But boisterously shunning women like this just makes men look like fragile snowflakes, more concerned with their ego than their actual safety. 

I'm saying let this be what it is: a reasonably defensive response to a misandrist political climate.

A woman's word has been held in higher regard than a man's for a rather long time.  The difference between pre-and-post #metoo is how covert contracts are considered, not who will be believed.  Being believed wasn't the issue, who would speak up was.  

The casting couch isn't a new idea, but the willingness to stay quiet about it used to be embedded in and enforced by the community.  Speak up, get black balled.  This is still an issue (ex. Terry Crews), but the folks that don't rise to the top no longer have a reason to stay quiet anymore, and some of the folks that do rise to the top can afford to shine a light on what's going on.

 I have been around some crazy feminists but my close friends and lovers were mainstream if they were feminist.    

Most of my friends are women and I like individuals more than groups so I am always breaking the Pence rule.  

I like drinking but don't mix it with sex much, especially with a new partner.  For the first time I like us to both be sober or close to it.  

All my lovers come from real life. I have never used any kind of dating service.  I am not particularly attractive to most women.  I have no game.  I can do very basic flirting but only started learning in my 30s.
I offer my phone number, not ask for one.  I seldom approach strangers.  

I have never been in a situation where I was aware of a woman expecting me to pay for her.  That type and I just repel each other.
Same goes for women who require the man to initiate or lead, I don't want to know.  I do my share and wait for a response.  

Yeah, I don't  get laid as much as I could. But I have never regretted anything.  There is not a single woman I have been with  that I would not be pleased to run into again.  

I have read a lot about false accusation including case histories.  But it seems like a different world, I don't really mix with that sort of person and situation. If something goes wrong we deal with it.  

My lifestyle won't suit many men but I don't think I would be at all worried about dating strangers or even having sex with people I hadn't known long so long as alcohol is not a factor. ",JebberJabber,t2_o9m32,0,0,reddit3

It's a toxic and dangerous movement, it conditions people to hate and identity certain individuals as ""the enemy"". This is something called **milieu control**:

[milieu control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milieu_control)

>Milieu control involves the control of communication within a group environment, that also may (or may not) result in a significant degree of isolation from surrounding society. When non-group members, or outsiders, are considered or potentially labeled as less valuable without basis for stated group-supported and group-reinforced prejudice, group members may have a tendency to then consider themselves as intellectually superior, which can limit alternate points of view, thus becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy in which group members automatically begin to devalue others and the intellect of others that are separate from their group, without logical rationale for doing so. Additionally, Milieu control ""includes other techniques to restrict members' contact with the outside world and to be able to make critical, rational, judgments about information.

White men are conditioned to be seen as the ""enemy."" However in your co-workers case, I think she is a psychopath and I absolutely think she did it on purpose.

You cannot give these people an inch or tolerate it for a second, you have to call it out directly and immediately when you can sense it happening.

Just a week before I was to start I wanted to go there and sign the papers and everything, but the guy told me there is some trouble I'll have to call next day.

He calls me next day apologizing profoundly, because apparently a colleague of mine had applied shortly before and she was female (I actually know her) 

He said she definitely has less qualifications than me, but she is a woman and he was overruled by HR and they _had_ to chose her.

That actually happened twice, but in this one instance I _know_ from the manager himself that I was taken away that job because there was another applicant that was female.

In looking over your list of ""infractions,"" this is exactly the kind of complete bullshit that I have observed women in female-dominated environments blowing completely out of proportion. There is a tendency in these environments for gossip to spread and one minor uncomfortable interaction to take the form of ""harassment"" after enough rumor and embellishment have taken hold. Once they think you're the ""sexist"" one, they'll just keep looking for more ""evidence"" until they've cooked up some crazy narrative that has little connection to reality. Which, clearly, was the case here.

Female-dominated environments are going to be a pain in the butt for almost any guy and if you have even the slightest interest in speaking your mind without literally being the company president/owner, you're not going to be perceived well.

For sex-based societal discrimination, the instructor asked me what I thought, and I said ""legal discrimination, for divorces and custody battles"" and she nodded and smiled and started writing it down and I continued ""it's much harder for men to get custody and they're more likely to have to pay alimony"" and the instructor looked outraged and said ""No! That's not true!"" and then explained that maybe it had been the case at some point but it was now the opposite.

This shut me down for a while, but then she asked about discrimination in prison, starting by saying that PoC get charged more for the same crime (which is true) and asking what other population was more likely to be imprisoned. None of the students were answering, so she turned to me again and I said ""Men?"" and the instructor, again, looked extremely disappointed (and possibly even disgusted). She said something like ""yes, but I mean, unfairly"", shrugging it off as men obviously being in prison more because they commit the crimes and women don't.

After that I shut up for good and figured next time she asked me to participate I'd remind her I'm not supposed to.

The next day, I was informed that I wasn't a good fit anymore and I was let go.

I'm a woman, too, so just pointing out these things gets you into trouble, even when you aren't a white cishet man (although if you are, you don't need to say anything, you're apparently guilty already).",Avistew,t2_7u7hb,1,0,reddit4

I have copped so much BS over the last 10 years and it's getting worse. I just don't say any opinions anymore and just do my job. But clients have said all sorts of shit to me over the years. I once lost a major client because the entire office except their boss (in her 50s)  went nuts. It's hard to explain without sounding sexist, but they were out of character for a few days, and I suspect they were all in sync with that time of the month. They'd snap at me, change their mind about decisions they'd made, they even sent an email with me CC'd, saying how bad I was at my job. I wasn't. I moved mountains for them and was always responsive, undercharging to keep them happy etc. Because they had an emotional moment, they cost me a large slab of my income and I nearly went out of business. 

As I'm into my 30s, still struggling with keeping my head above water, I've noticed a trend behind the instability and stress... women. The best clients I have had were men, but they made up only about 5 or 10% of them. I can't verbalize this without sounding like a misogynist but I crave a diverse client base for my sanity. I've lost many clients over the years due to maternity leave; my main contact will go on leave or quit to pursue family life, but they won't hand me over to their replacements because they don't reveal they're not coming back until their leave is up etc. Or they quit (and can afford to because they're married to someone making good money), only to be replaced by another person who also moves on soon after. But it is always my time and energy in getting them up to speed. 

I always thought so highly of women, I thought the best of people and gave them a shot. I'm not suicidal, but I do wonder whether the injustice towards men these days, will spark a movement which turns everything on its head. I do think all this BS you're experiencing isn't an isolated incident and that it'll start making people crack. I do hope there is a positive and reasonable outcome before this happens.

Add in the fact that it is seen as perfectly OK to discriminate against white males and it’s an uphill battle. Think about a jury. Even if it’s only 50% women you’ll be hard pressed to find 100% agreement unless you can discover iron proof evidence. 

If your in an “At Will” state and not covered by a collective bargaining agreement (Union shop), you can be let go for any reason, or no reason.  As long as they cover their tracks and you are under 40, you can’t claim discrimination. 

The environment sounds toxic. So while it sucks to be getting the boot, it may turn into a big favor to you.  It’s only a matter of time until this woman starts turning on the others now that the obvious (male) target has been removed.  $20.00 says the manager will be the victim of a list soon enough. 

Is this place the only one in your area that can use your skills?  Maybe look into a niche area of the same field.  If you’ve been there a while your experience will speak for itself. Just try to minimize the conflict part of the separation. Perhaps frame your leaving due to a change in management that made you uncomfortable. Or if you felt something could be improved maybe point to that as the catalyst. 

Don’t volunteer that you were retaliated against. Or that there was a personality conflict in the office.  Hiring managers ears will perk up, and your prospects will be down the toilet. Nobody wants to hire a troublemaker. ",creepyfart4u,t2_t44fr3m,1,0,reddit4

My manager has also commented on my appearance more than once, which is sexual harassment, and I reminded her of this (although I didn't put it that way). I stated that I felt this was incredibly hypocritical, but it didn't matter;

Life pro tip: In literally any context, this juvenile response will get you ignored by your manager and any reasonable person will immediately take the side of the other person.

A reasonable response is a defense of yourself-- you didn't say those things, those things were said in a context that affects their meaning, and to a lesser degree she never came to me with this and I would have been more careful if I'd realized how she was taking them. You briefly mentioned you said this, but very quickly moved past it to the rest of your ""defense.""

But as soon as you say ""well she said this and that and I could have been offended and wasn't"" or ""well you've commented on my appearance and I think that could have been sexual harassment to"" you sound exactly like a 6 year old saying ""BUT HE STARTED IT!!!"" 

The above is true without further explanation.

But in case you want additional context/information, here's just one of the many reasons the above will never work:

Context, as you noted yourself, does matter, and your manager currently does not know the context of the comments or the specific wording. She wasn't there when these things happened, and she is in the position of you said- vs your coworker said. She has to decide who to believe and how to respond. From her point of view, 3 things are possible: 1, you are guilty of sexist or insensitive statements and your young co-worker is not, because the context and phrasing of your statements were sexist, and the context and phrasing of hers were not. 2, you are both guilty. 3, she is guilty and you are not.

Given that you never complained about your co-worker and were never offended, there's no reason for her to assume 2 or 3. Why would she think your co-worker is guilty of sexual assault/insensitive comments if you only brought it up as a defense when you were accused of the same? Why wouldn't she just assume that you are a dick and don't realize when you're creating a problem, or that you willfully misunderstand context?

Additional note: you accused your direct supervisor of sexual harassment, but again, you never spoke with her before. How do you expect that to go down? We can basically consider 2 possibilities: one, she breaks down, realizes the error of her ways, and radically changes the way she speaks to you and looks at you. Two, she has had plenty of training and from her perspective does not feel she's ever said anything inappropriate, and she will then assume that you're either ignorant of context and phrasing (and therefore in dire need of sensitivity training) or that you're just making up shit to get out of trouble, in which case she will immediately assume that the same is true of all your other complaints. 

You said ""commenting on your appearance is sexual harassment"" which is nonsense. If that's what you think sexual harassment is, you need sensitivity training. It's unfortunate but true that many men really don't understand the difference between ""that's a really nice pair of earrings, I like them!"" or ""is that a new haircut? It look sgood!"""" which is fine and not sexual harassment, and the many creepy things you could say that would be sexual harassment, like ""You look really hot in that shirt,"" ""wow you look really attractive today,"" or ""you're the most beautiful person in the office."" 

So your approach here, regardless of any of your views on the terrible societal harm that men face and your desire to correct those wrongs, is juvenile and would never be attempted by a competent person in a professional workspace.

I'll go ahead and read the rest of your comment now, but I feel like it's important that you know this going forward with your life.

Edit: By the way, I dont' really care when you expand on the context. I get that you have a defense of everything you said, and honestly believe you never said anything wrong. That's irrelevant to what I said above, which is about how your response is likely to impact her perception. 

And edit 2: The fact that you came to a misogynistic echo-chamber to complain pretty much confirms that you were in the wrong here. Don't get me wrong, I see a very small place for a Men's Rights movement that is also respectful of feminism and its goals and works within the various movements towards greater social equality and fairness. But to me the fact that you were aware of this subreddit and your response was to come here and vent tells me you are very likely not the fair and balanced non-sexist person you claim to be. There are other subreddits for workplace-related complaints, venting, etc. But you have already assumed that any site that isn't dedicated to correcting injustic towards men will be unsympathetic to your views. You have a sort of vibe of ""the world is out to get me with their feminist liberal nonsense and the only way I can get a fair hearing is to come to the home of the good ol' boys and complain to them, because they too see the injustice of the world.""""",realvmouse,t2_104k08,-6,0,reddit4

It's so damn obvious to the sane person that white males are increasingly being belittled, bullied, minimized, sidelined, in a world consumed by SJW insanity. White males have little power to fight back against the SJW mobs, as well as no privileges, and less and less rights, because the Feminazis are busy trying to deny them to men.

Despite that it's hard to believe there isnt more to this story. I find that when people use the ""black friend"" argument they tend to also minimize their own behavior. That being said, you genuinely appear to be a therapist who knows what they're talking about. My question to you is what models do you use? CBT? Anything else you draw from a lot? 

My expectation (which could very well be wrong) is that you aren't a big fan of postmodern constructivist approaches like Narrative. If it is not, I wouldn't be surprised by your flippant use of such an argument. If you are, I'd point out the power of your decision in such a situation - having female friends who validate your list as not being problematic takes the onus off of you to actually understand if anything you said could genuinely be offensive and places it on your accuser who, judging by the context you've provided, could be expected to respond the way she has. I dont know your situation. What I do know is things do not seem to be adding up here.

I mean this genuinely - if you have an understanding of why much of your behavior could be interpreted as problematic and also believe that the problematic actions have not warranted this level of action, then I am sorry for patronizing you and I wish you all the luck I can. When people take what we say and manipulate it in a cruel, uncaring way that is truly despicable. If you cannot genuinely say that you understand why and how what you said **could** be interpreted as problematic, then i suggest you really question how it could be taken that way (especially if you fight back when its pointed out).

I really believe this young lady made up her mind about me the moment she met me, and everything I said and did went through a filter she had. And my manager as well had very strong opinions about men so when this list was presented to her, I don't think she handled it fairly.

I want to make a few things clear, though. I am not suggesting someone *shouldn't* be offended by the things I've said. So when I say other female friends didn't find these things offensive, I don't mean to imply ""see! They're not offensive!"" different people are going to find different things offensive. That's not my point or my concern. This is my point and my concern: I think there is a difference between someone finding something offensive and problematic behaviour. What I mean by that is what people are offended by is very subjective. I think there are things most of us would agree are offensive (eg racial slurs, etc) and so most of us would probably agree someone saying those things is problematic. But then there are things that most people would agree aren't offensive to most people, but some people will still find them offensive. And these are things you don't necessarily know will offend someone until after you've already said it. Furthermore, if this is just a difference of opinion, at what point are you not allowed to express your opinion on the off chance it might offend someone? Another concern I have is that *intention* is completely disregarded when you offend someone. NONE of my comments were intended to be offensive, malicious, mean-spirited, or anything like that. Most people would agree they weren't, some will agree they were. But my intentions don't matter; all that matter is how they are perceived. And this is frightening. I brought an extreme example up at our team anti-oppression training. I said what happens if we're talking in a team meeting and I make a comment about how I want to lose weight. Could that not be interpreted as me suggesting there is a correct body weight and therefore I am now body shaming? Intention needs to hold weight. Because anyone can be offended by anything and we can't just go running around trying to destroy anyone who offends us.

My other concern is how it was handled. Think about it from my perspective; me and this young woman disagreed on things from time to time, as humans do. But she took some of these disagreements and added them to a list, either taking me out of context or completely misquoting me.

In short there, the family was being subjected to a MASSIVE and COSTLY investigation by CPS and the OCFS because the OTHER household had the mother OD on heroin and speedballs or something almost died, AND the KIDS were THERE!!

My suggestion was to the family (that wasn't OD'ing on speedballs innfront of the kids) was to decide whether or NOT they wanted to cooperate with the CPS and OCFS. Something that is in their right to do. Then someone piped up about WHY they (OCFS-CPS) would want to RUN such a HUGE investigation on both families when one family was clearly NOT fit. 

My comment was an offend (but sometimes accurate) postulation that the ""could"" want to inflate the budget.

BAM. Lifetime BAN.

>it's a thing in Canada. 

If by ""It"" you're referring to non-continuation of contract employment, then *no fucking shit it's a thing in Canada*. It's a thing literally everywhere. That's the entire fucking *purpose* of contract employment, there's no commitment from any party aside from the terms of the contract. 

And additionally, non-continuation of contract employment *is not discrimination*. It's not discrimination when it happens to men or women, black or white, gay or straight. It just exists. And implying otherwise is fucking pants on head retarded ""my man"".

>It definitely applies to the conversation and the whole idea of people hating on white men.

No, ""it"" doesn't. Because the ""it"" you're referring to is a completely different area of employment law that is, by definition, not discriminatory. You would not call non-continuation of a contract held by a gay person to be sexual orientation discrimination. It's just non-continuation of a contract.

All of them are being paid far more for the job than they probably should be. Those are not inconsistent positions to have.

It's absolutely cheering someone to get paid less so you feel better. I actually laugh a bit because this EXACT thing happened where I'm working. Someone found out another guy got paid more than he did, then got a raise, then everyone bickered, and then the two guys both got pay cuts.

The article and his complaint is intentionally trying to stir shit when he admits he grabbed the job with no negotiation because he was worried about his job prospects. The additional fact that he isn't arguing he's more qualified leads me to think there's stuff left out.

So JBP said, ""well, all these things mimic female sexual arousal - lips blush during sexual arousal, as do cheeks, the high heels tip the pelvis up and forward mimicking sexual readiness, and the form-fitting suits display the 70% hip/waist ratio indicating fertility""

The interviewer absolutely didn't know what to think or do. He had clearly *never* thought about that, ever.

I disagree. Women don't like it when men use their power to get sexuality in the workplace. They don't mind it when men they are attracted to use their sexuality to get power in the workplace.  The thing is that Most men aren't able to make most women swoon.  

I've been flirty in the workplace many times to get benefits. Whether that was when I was 19 and selling laptops to college girls, or when I was nominated for an internal company award by a Female VP that I would talk to on my smoke breaks. Or the time I was put forward for promotion when my boss was leaving, a few weeks after we went on a ""ski-trip"" that she had organized, that I had thought she was bringing her boyfriend to, but was actually just the two of us in a room with a jacuzzi and a single king size bed.   


And more generally, When I was a teenager, I was flirty with all the teenage cashiers in the local fast food joints, and they would give me their employee discount. (I was a growing teenager, who moved heavy boxes 4 hours a day 4 days per week, I was hungry.)  

Women are just as vulnerable to these tactics as men, The only difference is that average men will get that way about average women. Average women only do it for men that drive them wild.  

Most of the time its a lot less overt than that. I'm charming, and I'm a born flirt, So when a female manager  flirts with me, I play ball, while treading the line of exactly what I say.  Its helped in situations where I've gone into a meeting with a bunch of higherups, And a few of the female ones, aren't listening to a word I say, but are watching me with rapt attention.

  Suddenly my idea has a whole bunch of traction, even though no-body understood a word I said.  (I work in IT.) When I worked at an MSP, when escalations were slow, they would send me to client meetings to meet the female controllers (basically the lead accountant).

There is a trick to avoid cleavage staring or glancing. 

I swear it works. 

When a woman with nice cleavage is looking at you , ONLY focus on one of her eyes. Only one eye. It must be done as the first thing you do when a woman speaks to you and gets your attention. 

Here is why it works.  The female face is like the letter (V), the face is like focal points in an art painting, drawing the eye around the painting. 

A womans face naturally draws the viewer down to the cleavage and all women are acutely aware of the power of their cleavage. 

Try it , I cannot resist looking down at cleavage, it is like a directional sign pointing down. 

But if at the onset I only look at one eye, pick one , does not matter and keep the focus. 

Pull up beautiful woman with cleavage on Google a see for yourself.

I’m friendly to everyone at work, but usually carry an air of friendliness to the point where they might wonder if I’m flirting and it’s worked well for me. I think men and women have different strengths and weaknesses, so it makes sense in a way for a woman to use her sexuality (if she’s attractive) and for men to use their stereotypical masculine traits (if they have them) to make waves.

I think the key here is for everyone to realize that workplace dealings, especially the field you mention, are artificial for the most part. Had a boss who was a hard ass, a man, he was what I think society deems an “alpha male.” Made a few men cry, but they respected him and got the job done. Outside of work though, like during happy hours, sweetest man ever. I have had slightly flirty exchanges at work where both parties left with a bit more of a spring in their step, and the key there was recognizing that it was just fun banter…No expectations because it’s work. However, when it came time for reviews and deciding who got raises, my positive exchanges were enough to get my name mentioned in the discussion. 

With that said though, I keep hearing about a sizable group of men who don’t get much attention, so I can see how this sort of workplace politicking could be harmful for them. …I’m not sure there’s a solution to it though because humans will human.

When a woman flirts in that scenario, she’s not actually interested in pursuing the man and won’t harm him or his company if he doesn’t welcome it. Most men, also, welcome it. That’s why it works so well.

When a man (who is the client) flirts, he is actually pursuing the woman herself, not any benefits for himself or the company. There is a real drive there, and it instantly makes a woman uncomfortable because she doesn’t know how he would react if she didn’t return the interest or rejected him. Would he make her lose her job? Would rejecting him lose him as a customer? Hell, he could even stalk her. In worst cases, get violent.

That’s the difference right there. If a man rejects the woman’s advances, 9.9 times out of 10 nothing happens. He just didn’t take the bait. If a woman does.. you don’t know what can happen. That’s what make it feel so high-stake and uncomfortable.",Izzetinefis,t2_96ok23nq,1,0,reddit3

And far too much of it falls into the ""watch my show because you *should* enjoy it just because I'm so persecuted and I'm under-represented in media and life is so much harder for me than for most people, but also fuck you for daring to think you can sympathize with me because you're the problem and you can't possibly understand my suffering, but still watch my show and call it brave and inspiring and genius"" milieu, which is, quite disappointingly, a thing.

Sex Education on Netflix is insulting. The female characters are toxic, constantly putting down the straight, male characters, which is somehow supposed to be endearing. Even when they blatantly show their toxicity, they blame *their own behavior* on the mythical ""Patriarchy.""

Gillian Anderson's character is disgusting. She invades her son's privacy incessantly yet guards all information about herself like her life depends on it, and instead of calling her on this hypocrisy, it blames male characters and makes them look bad to divert focus and just forgets all the horrible stuff she does. How about when she actually starts a serious romantic relationship and goes out of her way to hide it and lie about it to her son, who lives in the same house and sees her every day? No, no, nevermind that, back to what the men are doing wrong. She even tries to publish a book about her son's deepest secrets, then says she was writing it to get closer to him. Then why did she try to have it published!?!? What did *that* have to do with getting closer to him? Really, it was just so she could prove what power she had over his private information, but the show completely forgets about that and lets her off the hook. When her gathering of the students'  secrets through her *confidential counseling sessions* with them leads to all the kids' private stuff becoming public, it also gets blamed on a man. No, no, pay no attention to the fact that she collected it at all in the first place so she could write a book about it. Quick, look what that bad man is doing!

And the Maeve character is ridiculous. The show continually tells you how super, incredibly smart she is. Why she's practically the greatest genius of all time! Well, it's a good thing they constantly tell you that because you would have no idea from anything she ever says or does. Her choices are endlessly stupid, but, no, really, she's just so underappreciated. And, also, she's totally oppressed by the ""Patriarchy."" That's why none of her behavior makes sense.

I don't even want to get into the ""struggle"" of the nonbinary characters. Gay men in real life have been violently attacked and even murdered for being gay. But the nonbinary people in this show are oh-so tragically persecuted because they're politely asked to adhere to the dress code of the school they chose to attend and because they're shown a sex education video that doesn't include them, though exactly what that means is unclear since they still have the same reproductive organs as the other students.

And that show is just one example. I can't stand Disney's Marvel shows. The superhero shows on the CW got real old real fast. They've become about representation and whining and not quality entertainment. I want good TV, regardless of the color or gender or sexuality of the characters. The new Queer as Folk is overly pluralist garbage with selfish, irresponsible characters who want recognition just because they're not heteronormative. But what do they do that's actually worth recognizing? And, really, as if real people's groups of friends are so incredibly diverse, making sure to include as many types of people as possible.

igfi9u9,t3_w0jwdi,2022-07-16 19:28:00,MensRights,"> Nevermind that Top Gun - an arguably patriotic, male, testosterone, action movie has done billions of dollars in GLOBAL revenue for these same companies.

Top Gun: Maverick is telling a story that is not available to audiences right now, and therefore the movie is able to capitalize – with record-setting numbers – on that huge, unmet need in the marketplace. Considering how ""Maverick"" stands out among its contemporaries, isn't it strange how all these supposedly ""diverse"" shows are exactly the same? If you stop and consider the last few years, it's clear that this ""diversity"" push only gives us predictable and repetitive content (note: I feel it would be wrong to refer to such boring and lazy products as ""art""). Well, the reason for this is that Tinseltown is applying ""diversity"" at the wrong level, by trying to fit the concept into individual stories. Simply put, companies could employ the same racial mix of acting talent if they filmed Black Panther (all-black) and Peter Jackson's LOTR (all-white) as separate films, but instead they are idiots and choose to make two movies that have identical racially-mixed casts to try and achieve the same end result. There's actually a term – level confusion – for this common type of mistake in mathematics and statistics, because of how easy it is to do when dealing with groups of objects. Our brains and language naturally don't deal with multiple levels of things, so we get confused and believe things that are impossible. And speaking of impossibilities: ""diverse show"" is actually an impossible construct for the type of diversity they want to achieve (mathematically speaking, there is no such thing as an average, or variation from a median/mean, when the sample size is ""1""). I mean, if you could have a ""diverse show"" – a contradiction in terms, but let's say for argument that such an impossible object could actually exist in reality – then all you would need to do is clone and repeat that show, and you would successfully create a ""diverse"" industry. It's madness. If your presuppositions lead to the conclusion that all shows must be identical to each other in order to achieve ""diversity"", then you're doing something terribly wrong.

Unfortunately, I doubt this problem will be fixed anytime soon. People in Hollyweird lack the intelligence and long-term thinking required to apply diversity properly at the **industry** level, like they should be doing. And even if they could see their mistake, the problem is that they aren't strategically applying these quotas – and monitoring/measuring to find out when they are no longer needed – to combat actual attitudes of prejudice and injustice across the vast realm of arts and culture. No, they are doing it out of blind cowardice and a selfish, personal fear of being labeled an ""istaphobe"" of some kind. Just look at the recent way the GoT and Friends creators are bending over backwards to apologize for the ethnic ""homogeneity"" in those shows.

The dilemma is that apologizing and showing weakness like that only leads to more attacks and shakedowns of their business. Mature, strong leadership at the industry level would result in a much different response to any such attempts to slander these existing properties (and by proxy to try and stain the entertainment business as a whole). Imagine this statement instead from some overarching body or group: ""The entertainment industry remains committed to telling a diverse range of individual stories, whether primarily white or black, male or female, straight or gay, and more, including mixed casts of those groups as well, whenever the particular narrative being represented means it is appropriate to do so. Telling good, genuine stories means confining the setting to a specific time, location, and group of people, and we know this will – in time – give us a wonderful, diverse range of individual shows that will be very different from each other. As an industry, we are dedicated to telling a story for *everyone*, whether that is based on identity, socioeconomic, politicial, religious, or other group traits. We support the individual stories told by *Friends* and *Game of Thrones*, in the same way we celebrate all the distinct and personal creations in our industry.""

If these ""adult pretenders"" fail to stand up to the bullying, and don't fix their ""diversity incentives"" to stop discriminating against white males like yourself (though I hear that black males do get largely similar treatment...unfortunately, having a black female allows a company to check *two* ""protected class"" boxes on the budget refund calculator), then the industry will eventually die and be replaced (see the recent rise of Japanese anime/manga, South Korean TV dramas, independent content creations from YouTube, etc, Bollywood films, and more, as the beginning of this long-term trend).",RoryTate,t2_ghli7,4,0,reddit4

If you’d like to go further down the rabbit hole, look into *who* invests into companies like Netflix, Amazon, Alphabet (YouTube/Google), and other publishing companies. 

One principal culprit would be BlackRock (which, ironically, I bet you haven’t heard leftists criticise), the single largest and most valuable entity in history, who owns Vanguard among other things. They use something called an ESG score to decide which companies to invest into - this score ranks companies based on their environmental consciousness, social issue awareness (read: diversity quotas) and governance. In other words, companies are literally being paid to discriminate against white men. It’s not just BlackRock which uses ESG either, dozens of other multinational banks and investors use it in order to facilitate the “woke agenda”.",4damW,t2_6hg8nb4j,4,0,reddit4

It's infuriating in multiple ways. I could do a whole essay just on the insanely hypocritical, self-important, insipid, agenda-skewed, reductive, and manipulative sins of Good Trouble, which is a spin-off of The Fosters, which ended but was popular and almost as bad. But the biggest thing is how it does that thing I see under-represented groups do that I absolutely hate: attack their own allies. Or would-be allies. It blames and insults the very people they're simultaneously asking for sympathy and support from. It says ""you *have* to support me because you owe me, but, no, you're not supporting me *enough* and also it has to be in exactly the way I tell you to, and you have to flog yourself while doing it, and I'm not going to support you back because you suck, and don't you dare notice the people I hurt when I feel like it because I'm allowed to do that, and, by the way, you're welcome for my allowing you to do my bidding.""

It's the kind of thing that actually drives supporters away, and I can't stand how pleased it is with itself while being a terribly-written show. But my roommate watches a lot of stuff without noticing how awful it is. Some of it has been stuff we watch together, though.

Woke-ness ruined American Gods. And another adaptation of beloved Neil Gaiman material is clearly continuing the trend. I'm a huge fan of The Sandman comic, but I saw the trailer for the new Netflix series and said, nope, I'm out, before it even starts I'm out.

And it's not just American shows. Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, from Australia, has a feminist bent, but the main character is mature and fairly well-balanced about it, and the rest of the show is fun enough without making woke tendencies too much of a thing. But the spin-off, Ms. Fisher's Modern Mysteries, set decades later with the niece of the previous show's mc, goes completely into ""men are dumb brutes and women need to do everything for them and are the only ones who know anything yet men have all the power while women are deprived and oppressed because Patriarchy"" territory.

Doing the above will show very quickly what sort of relationship you're in, in this situation if she can't win, she'll try to hit you if she's trying to win, or she'll start to scream and yell uncontrollably. - Abusive relationship.

Or she'll calm down, go all submissive but attempt to manipulate you(you'll see this in real time) if you counter and pull her up on in, she'll revert to the fight response. - Abusive relationship.

i can only say( with respect) the lack of awareness of what they do is not entirely true

I believe many know what they do is wrong, but they justify it for many reasons( usually enabled by various groups in society).

The article shows a person committing emotional abuse and then calling it emotional labour, along with controlling behaviour.

It doesn't matter if you acknowledge it because you are not going to doing anything about it, or if you do, you would only change your behaviour for a very short period before  slipping back into bad behaviour.

&#x200B;

I'm more concerned about the slippery slope this has led to, especially that 2nd link you provided.

That kind of abuse( and yes it is abuse) leads to other forms of abuse such as physical abuse when they realise that they can't get the kind of fear response they want from you and then psychological abuse. I consider psychological abuse to be far worst because its the one that is hardest to pinpoint and the longest lasting( sometimes leading to indirect death through mental health, depression and suicide).

maybe the worst part of all of this is the double standards that are applied to people based on their gender by letting women off the hook for their behaviour, but somehow men are monsters if they do this( I don't believe it is acceptable for anyone regardless of gender).

This has a very detrimental effect on society, and we only have to look at the legal system to see how my damage it does to men,women and their children.

fathers very often have little choice but to accept all the abuse in its various forms or to risk never seeing their children again( even when they become adults you will lose them)

There are women complaining that their spouses are lazy, and thinking that applies to all men. There are men complaining that their spouses are abusive, and thinking that applies to all women. Can we just acknowledge that a certain percentage of people in general suck, and that this isn't a male or female thing?

The emotional labor argument can be a real thing. Sometimes there are couples where the man expects the woman to do all of the cooking, cleaning, planning, etc. when they're both working full time jobs. Those are reasonable expectations for a stay at home mom, but not for someone who works the same number of hours. Those women are rightfully upset at the men who refuse to do their share.

And sometimes it's the opposite, a man doing his part but a woman who doesn't do her share or endlessly nags her spouse because nothing is ever good enough... and occasionally those women claim to be the ones being wronged because they're doing ""emotional labor"" of being a never satisfied control freak. But that doesn't mean the first scenario never happens.

Anyway, I'm sure the reverse of this will show up on TwoX any day now, how ""nagging"" is the term man use when they want to be lazy but still insult the person doing all of the work, or something like that...",chocoboat,t2_4ure3,11,0,reddit1

h41kvai,t3_odi2ma,2021-07-04 17:35:37,MensRights,"I think there’s a disconnect here between what women are saying regarding emotional labor, and how it’s being interpreted here. Emotional labor in general is a pretty broad term, but it encompasses a variety of different soft skills which are easy to overlook.

While it can seem as though nothing is enough, that’s not really true. Think of it this way, a relationship is a house, and each person involved helps to build the house, working together on the foundation, individual rooms, and so on. The things that go into building this house can be just about anything you do as a couple, whether it’s dates, lunch, chores, meeting with friends, watching Netflix, making decisions together, etc. So when the term emotional labor is used, it usually means some kind of imbalance which either wasn’t agreed upon or hasn’t been addressed is going on while constructing this house. For example, a woman planning a Mother’s Day outing for her mother might find the number of tasks between deciding where to go, what to get, what to make for dinner, etc. overwhelming, especially if there isn’t much time do so. This is where her partner could make her life significantly easier, whether it’s in the physical tasks of preparing the day or the emotional/mental labor of planning parts of the day. While it may not necessarily be “your job”, it clearly demonstrates interest and engagement with both your partner, their family, and the relationships that your partner has with their mother.

We can extend this into everyday living with your partner, whether you’re building your house with a date, a dinner, lunch, meeting with friends, all of it requires some amount of planning, most of which can be fairly open ended(“What should I make”, “What should I wear”, “Where should we go”, “What should we watch”, etc.). If you’re in a relationship where your partner is making most of those decisions, then over time it’s going to come off as though your partner is doing most of the labor to build the house, while you’re just enjoying the scenery.

I don’t want to discount the fact that, inevitably, emotionally abusive women exist, in the same vein that emotionally abusive men exist. But by jumping to categorize all women, or most women, as one thing or the other, we lose their perspective and don’t get to appreciate the nuances between people that make each of us who we are. A little empathy can go a long way in understanding where exactly many women are coming from whether they’re frustrated about emotional labor, or another uncomfortable experience they’ve had. 

Hopefully all that makes sense, feel free to message me with any other questions though.",allyeet,t2_42osunau,-4,0,reddit1

Edit: You should probably use those cRiTiCaL tHiNkInG skills everyone always preaches about in these manosphere subreddits to consider The Federalist is a right-wing rag, and that your post is making several fallacious assumptions to paint women with a broadstrokes mentality that will do you more harm than good. You made some very tenous hypothetical scenarios to portray a ""bitchy"" and abusive woman and sloppily applied terms like ""emotional labour"" to this strawman argument that I do not quite understand, other than it sounds very similar to a very hyperbolic and toxic mentality of ""NiceGuy"" or ""NotLikeTheOtherGirl"" types. Perhaps a controlling woman is controlling, but that doesn't make things like ""emotional labour"" an oppressive tool that *every woman uses* in some conspiratorial end to what, erode your sense of self worth and masculinity? This term can also be referred to as emotional intelligence and it isn't necessarily an exact science or measurable trait so much as a practiced quality of individuals' personalities and an area of psychology. To have a high degree of self-awareness or be a high self-monitor might mean lower neuroticism or higher conscientiousness and other big five O.C.E.A.N traits that might describe emotionally competent people.

One bone I have to pick with your post is your framing of that bazaar post in a very dubious light. The sentiment of the article of ""Women Aren't Nags - We're Just Fed Up"" is that an incredulous partner ought to pick up the slack in what today is a more equitable world anyway. It's a very childish mentality to think women in domestic partnerships today asking for a thoughtful gift like a house cleaning service for a day is somehow an indication of being an abusive woman. How about the schlubby husband who's too cheap to want to do that but instead do it himself (maybe poorly) or buy something else to appease a very simple need? How about the front facing roles women are often relegated to in the workforce still today (bUt wHy dOn'T tHeY jUsT gO iNtO STEM?) have to deal with disproprtionately more emotionally draining people in their services, all while being ""nice"" or a ""bitch"" if she shows any dip in emotional job intelligence of her own? And then when she returns home from work and her husband is too incredulous to have that understanding, it sounds like yeah, maybe he *is* a bit of a dud. All of your post oozes some angry frustration that women don't know their place, and if not, I'm all ears given my unfair generalizations must be the only ones in this thread.

If not, you're undeniably participating in a toxic part of reddit and general online culture of the so called manosphere that bleeds over into the MGTOW movement, TheRedPill, WalkAway, Incels and other nefarious or sketchy parts of the internet that lend themselves to fostering hatred and bigotry in men in particular.

.1. ""Emotional labor"" is just a shit test BS term. Ignore it or agree and amplify it into ridiculous levels. 

.2. Why are you doing chores trying to please her? No seriously, why? I can think of 3 reasons.

a. You want her to be happy because then she'll give sex. **Answer**: Doing chores will never impress her in a fashion that makes her want to have sex, full stop, if that is your only reason just stop now.

b. You feel guilty because she is berating you about things you haven't done. **Answer**: Clean up your shit before she has a chance to talk to you about it, own your mess and be an adult. If you are already doing this but she doesn't give you even 5 minutes to clean up after yourself before then she doesn't respect you and this is just a symptom of other relationship problems.

Why are you ""helping"" around YOUR house? This is your house, whatever you do isn't helping her, it's your God damn house. Even if she is on the deed/lease too, that just means it's half hers as well. Change your mindset immediately. You aren't helping her, you're helping yourself.

c. You've been slacking and you feel the need to announce it when you actually do something. **Answer**: See the above. be an adult. Hold her to the same standards you set yourself.

.3. If any of the above is true, fix yo shit. You don't have to listen to her complain, but her complaining is just a symptom of relationship problems that she doesn't know how to fix, and really only you can fix them. 

Men and women aren't equal when it comes to, well nearly everything besides civil rights (really not there either, women currently have more civil rights).


.4. (SITUATIONAL) If she is a stay at home type while you work, why are you doing anything again? Unless she is working from home or raising multiple children of YOURS, you need to be clear with her on her expectations and delegate that to her. Be a leader and tell her what to do if she isn't doing it.


99% of this is fixed just by you being a proactive leader in the relationship instead waiting around for her to complain. Being a proactive leader will have the side benefit of making her panties moist too, so it's a win win for both of you.

If I change the place of something she goes berserk and won't rest until that something sits at a spot she likes. It doesn't matter that something impedes me or she, or it's more logical. If I protest that's a fight. If I don't do work, she complaints to her friends that I am lazy. 

So to avoid fights I have to change how I act, move, do things, say things and still it's impossible to avoid fighting unless I just leave and avoid her. 

And I am %100 sure that if she had the physical strength she would beat me every single day. But much emotional work such labor. Wow.

>Any confidence you had in yourself is gone, and you stop doing those things you wanted to; you always get them wrong, anyways. This is the real kicker: Now you'll be blamed for not doing enough.

You should already know exactly how to do the thing, to the last detail. You should already know all that, and the only reason you don't is because you're not good enough.

She has to remember all the birthdays and upcoming events, she has to plan anything they're doing that requires planning, if they have a kid she does most of the child care.

h41i2tw,t1_h41dx6q,2021-07-04 17:13:03,MensRights,"Let's put it like this.

I understand it's a problem to have a nagging controlling partner. I know it can make you feel like some domain of everyday life just isn't your own because they're acting like they own it.

But the man in the story sounds like he doesn't consider household chores his obligation. When he does them, he feels like he's ""helping out."" He feels like he should be told what to do. Should grown adults be told to wash the dishes or do the laundry or are those basic things just expected of everyone? And then he complains he can't read her mind because he wasn't told to do a normal everyday chore that everyone should just do.

Of course, the situation is different if she's not working and he is. Or if they have some agreement on who does what and he does his own fair share, but then she expects more.

But the way it was written makes it sound like the men feel virtuous or helpful for doing basic things they'd be doing anyway if they lived alone.

Again, if they were made to feel that way by a controlling woman who always considers herself a manager of the household, but then gets mad when others start expecting her to be, I get that. But I'm not sure from OP whether that's the case or whether the man didn't do his fair share to begin with.

EDIT: Or even if he did his fair share, did he consider that as a favor to the woman because he thinks of it as her responsibility somehow.

h44ga6f,t1_h43q3le,2021-07-05 12:40:07,MensRights,"To get started I’ll first disagree with your use of always, only a Sith deals in absolutes 😉. As far as why men are more often told to empathize, while I’m no expert and havent educated myself in women and gender studies, as I understand it boils down to a very large set of historical and cultural trends between 1-3rd wave feminism and the long standing historical status of women who’ve generally had less economic, social, and political power than their male peers. So what’s expressed today is generally a reaction both to those historical developments, and to those individuals in someone’s life who demonstrate a lack of empathy or interest in engaging their partner, with the affirmation of others who’ve experienced similar circumstances of disengagement.

Regarding the “oppression olympics”, that has to do more directly with what I mentioned above with men historically holding the majority of economic, social, and political power, and oppression typically operates from those who have more power against those who have less, but that is not to say anything of someone’s individual circumstances. Individually and interpersonally we’d need to get back into the nuances of someone’s personal life, not necessarily to “out-oppress” someone else, but to understand who they are as a person, because obviously broad generalizations inevitably hit walls when reaching individuals, and that nuance can easily be lost when talking about historical and systemic trends.

The house if fine being it whatever condition it finds itself in, it is the people in the house who have the problem.

If there is such a thing as ""emotional labor"" to begin with, in a partnership the degree to which it is shared must be agreed upon...just like every other shared resource or liability in the relationship.

People have different standards and tolerances for the conditions in a household. I have no problem letting the pre-rinsed dishes stack up in the drying rack until there is enough to run a load, but my wife insists the ""correct"" place for them is in the dishwasher.  Am I an immature partner because I don't do it her way?

My wife likes to let (clean) laundry pile up around her part of the bedroom rather than put it in away. I like to put my stuff directly into the closet and dresser. Is my wife immature because she refuses to put her laundry ""away"" like I do?

Problems like this occur when people have different expectations about a shared experience, and do not effectively communicate it with one another.

>Really look at what your doing, your making up a hyper specific situation, one where not only is there no children, and the women doesn't work

I will not agree or disagree about the situation being hyper specific, but this is a common enough occurrence to talk about. OP is talking about when a lot of relationships fail between men and women, the woman will only highlight her good doings and not do a proper self reflection while only focusing on what the man couldn't be to her. The term emotional labor comes into use by these woman. Now how can you quantify and measure emotion, it is not something very tangible and fluctuates making it harder to pinpoint an issue.

I'm missing the point of this paragraph please elaborate on how this ties in?

>Most women arnt nagging their husbands for no reason, their nagging them because it's they have asked them to things a dozen time before

I'm not pretending like men are saints here. They have got to get their shit together. Nagging isn't something you do to a partner, it is something for close family or a marriage that has lasted a long time deserves that privilege. You communicate and you break things down, and if thing don't improve you leave. But in many relationships it is not one sided.

OP is talking about when a lot of relationships fail between men and women, the woman will only highlight her good doings and not do a proper self reflection while only focusing on what the man couldn't be to her....


The point I'm trying to make is that there I massive differences between ""emotional labor "" and poor communication. And I think you get that, but I think it's important the the misuse of a concept by people does not invalidate the concept as a whole. 

>You act as if there is a natural balance in the workload in any given household. That by God given grace, we achieve balance with out any societal changes. And that women pointing this out is abuse. Our societal standard were build when women didn't work. When women didn't have a right to vote. When domestic abuse was all but legal. 

What I'm trying to get at here is the focusing on why the term exist, when feminist we talking about the idea of the ""second shift"" and emotional labor, it come from a place where we as a society view the work that men and women do as inherently equal. Feminist were try to vocalize a feeling that alot of women have that there was a level of inequality, one that as you say was not easily quantifiable. And further more one which they were forbidden to talk about In the past.

> I'm not pretending like men are saints here. They have got to get their shit together. Nagging isn't something you do to a partner, it is something for close family or a marriage that has lasted a long time deserves that privilege. 

This confusing me, on one hand you dismiss nagging as poor communication, but on the other you seem to understand that once a relationship has gotten to a certain point is understandable. I think there is something thats important here which is the whole ""mind reading"" side. I think it is a sign of a healthy relationship where you know what your partner wants, and I think it's natural to want a partner who understands you. It almost seems like your saying ""women are expecting a level of intimacy on to a relationship that is just not present"" which is fair but is def a case by case issue.

> I do not belive that emotional labor is exclusively on the men like women presented in this post say it is NOT women as a whole

>This confusing me, on one hand you dismiss nagging as poor communication, but on the other you seem to understand that once a relationship has gotten to a certain point is understandable

Yes, in a relationship you do not talk AT your partner, you talk to them and with them to problem solve together. Nagging is after decades of being together and still being able to focus in what's important to maintaining the relationship. Women should not be nagging men because in a general sense men are working a lot of hours and so may not be 100% when getting home or even on a day off. And this comes to the next pint of your quote,

>. I think there is something thats important here which is the whole ""mind reading"" side.

This should never be a full on expectation. I expect my partner to do basic tasks and handle responsibilities, the ""mind reading"" aspect is something that only happens after long-term commitment and truly being able to work through issues. Relationships can be fun but they are work and a lot of people (mainly women) seem to not understand this, and if they do they want to have it as easy as possible.

Some of the issues we're seeing here in regards to emotional labor is its invisible and outright dismissal. Take for example OP post, the idea that ""planning stuff"" is framed as not really work. When it most certainly is, we literally have whole occupations for this, secretaries. So when these issues are brought up and discussed it is important to realize, it's not just about the work being unequal, it that the work is unequal, and we don't even realize how unequal it is.

That is not to say men don't ever do anything that women don't recognize, but I think it is important not to dismiss trying to be more open about the rolls people play. Often times I hear in response to how much women do, is this kinda pissing contest of how much men do, which I think is the wrong approach. 

Like imagine we we at a job together, and I was venting to you about how hard I work, and how I get no help from other staff members, and your response was, well I work hard too, sometimes harder! It just comes off as tone deaf and not really solving the problem. 

I do think we should be more open about the work and effort men put into a relationship, talking about things that are taken for granted. like men being forced into leadership roles in the relationship. If mens rights issues are to be taken seriously>!!< that's what should be done. But, it can't come at the cost of attacking women's issues, issues that historically and even currently in some areas, have been silenced.

> times I hear in response to how much women do, is this kinda pissing contest of how much men do, which I think is the wrong approach. 

I understand but part of the reason is that a lot of women today hold high standards and expectations of men to do a lot for a job. Then on top of that they need help with house work. Men have to do a lot because of womens standards of men today.

I do believe we need to be more open about these issues but there won't be true equality because we will always have to pull weight more in some areas vs others. Does this mean men should be slobs and careless no. I even notice women complaining about their man not doing enough but they don't say they help with car jobs, they don't go and grab a lawnmower to cut grass etc, and that is with little to no kids or if the kids are in helping age.

Let me put it another way, I don't care to get a laundry list of what each person does and compare the two. I think it's honestly reductive and ultimately unhelpful in the grand scheme of things. What I do care about is talking about the things that one or the other don't know is happening, or how much work it actually is. 

I already know the wife does the cleaning, and the husband mows the lawn. Why should we talk about things we already know? Why not focus on the thinks that are not very apparent, like how stressful it can be constantly have to keep track of everything in the house, how hard it can be to maintain a calendar, or the checkbook. Most people take for granted the idea that these things happen and are easy, but they're not and can be a burden. Where as mowing the lawn, I know hard and time consuming that is.

> I even notice women complaining about their man not doing enough but they don't say they help with car jobs, they don't go and grab a lawnmower to cut grass etc, and that is with little to no kids or if the kids are in helping age. I would like to hear your thoughts on this.

You talk alot about cars and mowing the lawn, but you realize these are things that happen once a week at best. Realistically Most care stuff is once every 3 months at best. And that's assuming that a man is doing that. Depending on your income bracket it's not all that strange to take your car in for an oil chang instead of doing it yourself ect. Where as dishes and cooking are done every day, cleaning is an ongoing process, and keeping track of appointments and what you have is constant.

Like again I really don't want to compare and contrast here, but when we are talking about emotional labor, saying men do thing once every so often vs the constant burden of maintaining a household it will come off as shallow. To use an analogy women are put in to role of manager and work, while men just get to be worker. When talking emotional labor, women want men to take some of that Manger role.

Like we live in a world where men and women almost work jobs almost just as much. Especially if there are no children it's pretty rare for a couple where 1 is full time and one is stay at home. Why should we hold to a standards of a time where that was the case?",xlem1,t2_hxwv6,1,0,reddit1

hd5ljmv,t3_ppkfjn,2021-09-17 01:40:52,MensRights,"Bro, lots went on here 4 sure & bet u got a few lessons too. Dude's have been straight up raped & ended up in jail for week while we ""investigate"". Shit u have to have seen the videos of a dude getting hit by a car & still he caught the charge. Anyway u know u fucked up reporting it as ""man up"" & ""handle it"" is always expected of men.

So here's the advice: hit up the coworker friend. You need a witness 4 sure. It might be to far gone to 'win', but a witness will at least soften the L.

I've been the witness. Work buddy fired & I knew the whole situation. HR never talked to me & just issued the axe. So when he called asking if I'd be a witness & his lawyer thought it would help. I said ""absolutely it's the right thing to do"". I then went to my own HR guy as I still worked for the company (same guy that fucked up the termination). I told him what was asked & if there was some policy I'd violate or something. He said no violation just say what happened. (He then did finally interview me on the situation. Month late but that's his problem.) Anyway a week later literally ""on the clock"" I'm on a call as a witness against my own company! Bosses I'd never met, a mess of HR people, lawyers & a judge. All I did was answer questions & state the facts. Purely a witness. I'm no judge; that parts not my job, so nothing to worry about. 
Long story not short because I'm telling it. Buddy ended up winning his wrongful termination & my company had to pay his salary (including back pay) until he found another job. I kept working for the company for 3 more years. The HR guy that fucked the whole thing was gone in less than 2 months. 

Morale of the story: use all the resources u have to not get fucked!! Then learn your lesson: that even if u get shot!! Keep your fuckin mouth shut!! Your a man; nobody gives a shit anyway.",stonedkc350,t2_1pcfk5yf,9,0,reddit2

>The law protects you from [retaliation](https://www.eeoc.gov/retaliation) (punishment) for complaining about harassment. You have a right to report harassment, participate in a harassment investigation or lawsuit, or oppose harassment, without being retaliated against for doing so.

Since you have already been fired, you need to obtain a lawyer and file a complaint. 

>You always have an option of filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC to complain about the harassment. There are specific time limits for filing a charge (180 or 300 days, depending on where you work), so contact EEOC promptly. 

**Firing you AFTER you made an accusation of harassment is particularly damning.** If they do not demonstrate just cause - including documentation of steps taken to remediate unprofessional behavior - then they are very likely to be in deep shit.

Get started on this *now.* For a major hospital system, you are looking at quite a bit of money. At minimum, you might be able to get your job back, missed income, and interest.

hd5bud5,t1_hd4conf,2021-09-17 00:24:19,MensRights,"I worked in a female-dominated workplace that was toxic with bullying. The HR Manager, also a woman, was one of the bullies.

I watched a manager berate someone for a mistake until they were in tears. It maddens that they're all getting a pension now for being abusive assholes. 

[Women have an in-group bias.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8226295_Gender_Differences_in_Automatic_In-Group_Bias_Why_Do_Women_Like_Women_More_Than_Men_Like_Men). Men do not. Yet one more reason that patriarchy theory is not based on facts or science.

Men don't generally work together to help other men. If men are working together, it's usually to promote class interests - whether they be rich or working class. 

However, what I'm wondering is what why aren't we reacting to the scientific fact that women have an in-group bias?

The Woke will accept that the hiring managers at Google have an implicit bias against women they can't seem to purge - or find in the first place - but won't do anything about the **fact** that female hiring managers will automatically prefer other women over the men there?

What difference is there between rape and consenting sex?

Only what  was in her mind at the time.

She can claim she didnt consent. is there evidence she didnt?

The entire thing is a terrible issue because sex is so common and proving what was IN HER MIND is literally impossible, unless there are other factors. This is why judges used to ask ""what was she waering"" back when women didnt wear slutgear unless they were cruising for dick.

Because that is a secondary indicator of her state of mind. As good as it gets. Just like a text ""I want your dick"" is STILL only a secondary indicator, becuase she could text that, but then laugh at him and turn him down if he tries to make a move because she's ""joking"", either truthfully or because she changed her mind and is gaslighting him to save face for herself.

So even a text saying she wants sex doesn't prove that she consented AT THE TIME to the act of sex. It could be that she wanted to, cahnged her mind, so he raped her because he didnt want her to go without him getting laid.

In that case, the text would ""damn her to rape"" because ""she was asking for it"", just like in the history of feminism they complained judges asking ""what was she wearing"" was ""asking for it [to be raped]"", which was COMPLETE BULLSHIT, but which was a cornerstone of their malicious arguments.

This is the office that sets the agenda for which issues of sexism get addressed, and controls the dynamic our government sets as standard in terms of gender power relations.
In terms of who is responsible for what, it's far more reasonable to suggest we're a matriarchy than a patriarchy.
It's also worth noting that this office, 2/3rds women (who are paid more than their male counterparts, and that this trend is escalating), is the same office that refuses to countenance mens issues being on the agenda, and routinely pushes a doctrine that erases mens issues.

Notably, they also tend to push for more women in areas in order to achieve equality, but not more men in several professions, including their own office. Their pay gap also suggests that the culture of this particular office is slanted in womens favor, and I remind you, this is ultimately the office that sets the stage for how gender power dynamics are addressed and refined. Crucially, they also tend to push the idea misandry doesn't exist. No shit they think that, barely any of them experience it.

My suggestion would be to balance the numbers by explicitly hiring enough mens advocates to bring the ratio to 50/50, which would still leave then underrepresented, but more represented.

To call us a matriarchy seems more apt than calling us a patriarchy using the kind of feminist logic that would bee similar to calling a government environmentalist, when every single position in the environment agency was given to and held by climate change deniers who set policy according to that belief.

Mens issues not getting a fair hearing is almost certainly due in part to this institutions bias and lack of diversity, causing them to set an agenda that ignores mens experiences and issues.

Since this institution is the one that sets the agenda for gender relations, I'd call it matriarchal.",azazelcrowley,t2_eu1ns,6,0,reddit3

But at the gym it is a different story. I don't look. I don't touch and I only talk to if I need to use the machine/bench they are using. It's always a ""good morning/day/evening how many sets do you have left in that machine/banch"" ""thank you"". If I notice headphones I put my hand in front of their eyes (at a distance) so they notice I want to ask something. With dudes I'm way friendlier and even ask for spots or offer to spot. A girl I don't care if the bar falls on her back, I'm not reaching out to help unless I can do so without any physical contact and I don't even look at them.

I used to be neutral and behave with them the same way I do with dudes, but once I approached to use the squat rack, toucher her shoulder after she finished her set and asked how many she had left. She took the headphones out and loudly said ""get off me you creep, I have a boyfriend"". I quickly replied that I wouldn't touch her even with her bf's dick, turns out the boyfriend was in the gym and wanted to get physical. No fight happened but all eyes were on us and I got a warning from the gym manager (her boyfriend too, but not her). So I concluded it just isn't worth and I can avoid any comments if I reduce interactions to the bare minimum. This had never happened to me, probably it happens more often with unattractive guys. I'm far from a Brad Pitt but I do take care of myself. The thing is, no matter how attractive you think you are, there will always be a dumb cunt who'll use the opportunity to lash at you due to her bad day or her period or wtv.

Exactly...       

The laws themselves are biased.. That's why men need to protect themselves from biased laws.   

Paternity fraud- absolutely legal.   
F on M - legal unless there is penetration.    
Parental alienation - legal.     
False allegations - legal and encouraged.

Men can't really approach that problem any other way then ignoring women silently. Its a damned if you do and damned if you don't kind of thing. 

While im very aware that feminism is about women's issues, the thing is just that when we are talking 'about equality between the sexes' then *that* is somehow the thing that feminism stands for. Feminism doesn't champion equality between the sexes, it wants every by them perceived 'privilege' enjoyed by men in society while at the same time refusing to let go or even look at their own privileged position within society.

The problem that is described isn't so much that men are ignoring women in the workplace, the problem is that men in the workplace don't feel safe enough to engage with these women. There just is no upside for men to engage women in their workplace, most of the time they'll just get called in to do the shitty jobs that the women refuse to do.

Of course we should continue to spread awareness though whenever possible, despite the attacks.  

The only effective response I can come up with is simply non-compliance.  Don't help women, don't talk to women, don't hire women, do not be friends with women.  Foster strong male relationships.  Spend time with your father, with your brothers.  Create male bonds.  Start male groups for hiking/camping/fishing/hunting.

They will only respond when male absence is strongly felt.   When no one shows up to help them change that tire, lift that sofa into the house, fix that broken door etc.  They don't care one bit for our statistics of male suicide, our cogent explanations of why the family court devastates men etc.  They just don't care.  Nothing you SAY will mean anything to them.  It's what you DO that counts.  And what we need to do is simply stop complying, stop showing up to help.

It's only made hard by our biological drive to have sex.  Aside from that internal battle of penis vs brain, we would have no trouble at all walking away.

But their reaction sadly proved my point. Denial of problem and anger towards men...

So what can men do?

1. If you are falsely accused - don't apologize. Trying to be nice, calm and appease is the biggest mistake. They have not much proof, until you acknowledge any wrongdoing. Even if you think you didn't do anything really bad, your words will be perverted and used against you. Now you seem guilty and people who could sympathize you won't help you.

2. If you are aware of a colleague being accused without proof and have at least some reasons to believe him, side with him. This may damage you, but silence is worse. You might be next.

3. Don't alienate all women. Cutting off social contacts with women is not giving you much security, but makes you look bad and in the same time powerless - connections are power. There are plenty decent women. Make friends with them. If you are in danger, they might protect you. Still, you should be very careful, sociopathic and sexist women are dangerous and it is important to understand who is who.

galw6b4,t3_jkut2w,2020-10-30 15:24:44,MensRights,"Yes, this fear is real and it sucks. We should listen to men and hear out concerns.

It seems to me this is similar to (albeit a bit aged) concerns of men falling into infidelity at the work place. Some men would use guidelines/rules to prevent it. Think of Mike Pence-he gets slammed in the media for his rules round what he can and can’t do and where he can and can’t be with women. He doesn’t eat alone with women, for example. 

He gets slammed for this in part because it is assumed that he does eat alone with other men-and that’s how this “hurts women.” It’s not necessarily that there are restrictions - it’s that the restrictions apply specifically to women and not to men. I don’t think Mike Pence’s rule in itself is bad. Marriage is hard. The troubling part it it’s only limiting for women.

I think there are lots of gender neutral ways to address this, some of which we’ve already seen, such as clear glass panels/windows into offices so there is privacy of conversation but both parties can be seen. Encouraging work lunches rather than happy hours/dinner, so there is a return to work after the meeting. Setting up a mentor program with guidelines. Only meeting up after work hours in groups. Paper trail showing consensus on when and where and how long to meet...etc.

gao2kz6,t3_jkut2w,2020-10-31 03:28:00,MensRights,"There are several ways to mitigate this problem:

 -  Character.  How you behave over time gives others an impression of who you are, and how you are likely to act.  If you constantly push the envelope, or get involved in controversy, people will be less likely to vouch for you when someone points the finger at you.  Same goes for keeping your nose clean.  I have written character references for people who I've known for years, and trust, and others did the same, and it saved them.  On the contrary, I refused to do so for someone who had many problems over the years, and would always antagonize while never quite crossing the line, but one day, it finally got the best of him.  Your reputation speaks volumes.

 - Mitigate time periods where you are alone with someone without a witness.  This is especially true for those you don't know, those who act/dress provocatively, or have questionable work ethic.  

   - Get a feel for those you don't know to build their character.  For the actions/clothing, if a woman is being overly flirtatious, or dressing/make-up like she's going on a date/social gathering more than she's dressing for work (how do I put it... making ""heads turn""), it could be to bait people into bad situations to be able to push a harassment button.  As for the poor work ethic, when they know the walls are closing in and their job may be in jeopardy, they may be looking for a way to save it by making harassment accusations.  Don't be the one that gets caught up in that.

 - Lastly, the most difficult is dealing with those who have a rap sheet of filing sexual harassment complaints.  Like the one who overhears an off-color joke or comment, and she made a bee-line up the chain of command to HR to snitch instead of handling it ""at that level"".  Someone set something down next to her, and accidentally bumped her butt; stuff like that.  We all know the difference between snitching, and not.  Someone who has done this (snitched) is more likely to do it again, and they are also likely to play the ""being blackballed, ostracized, etc."" card, when people are wary of this person for these reasons.  It can be difficult to maintain professionalism around these types, and you should avoid being alone with them or doing certain tasks that require physical contact that could be in compromising positions.  If it is unavoidable, bring this up with a supervisor alone, and if that doesn't work, address it in public.   ""Hey, I don't feel comfortable working just 1-on-1 with (name) due to pass misunderstandings.  I require a more open setting, or need more people assist with this task?"".

Lastly, it shouldn't be some political battle or an ""us vs. them""/ male vs. female sort of thing.  People who have got caught up in bad situations view it more cynically, and rightfully so.  Most of the time people are good to each other, and in the instances they aren't, we need to be vigilant and protect ourselves.",XiJinpingPoohPooh,t2_8ljiqqjk,1,0,reddit1

Be careful... right there with just that one sentence and nothing that followed, you already showed sexism in the minds of many.  Even this sentence shows sexism to many: 'My job at work isn't to make people feel better.'  By discounting feelings as anything less than crucially important to your job, many feminists will argue that you are being male-centric, and insensitive since it is a ""male characteristic"" to value facts and raw performance over feelings.  Sadly, I have to deal with this attitude all the time in my work.  

I work in academe, but the infection of this sort of thinking is spreading outside of academe.  Our basic hope at this point is that it will suffer a sort of negative natural selection halting the spread before it reaches too many of the societies more vital functions.  Normally this would happen naturally since since such thinking intrinsically embraces attitudes and approaches that don't work.   But I'm increasingly not optimistic for the patient's survival.  The parasites who embody this sort of thinking seem to be able to evade normal immune responses that organizations mount against people working against the organization.  The mechanism for this immune evasion seems to be linked to a complex system of virtue signalling that allows parasites to pretend to be normal employees until their numbers are high enough to effect a local take-over of some sub-tissue or department of the organization.  At that point the infection is able to change policies and practices to match their habitat preferences and also to more overtly pressure out non-parasite employees to consolidate control.",Lucretius,t2_4341,32,0,reddit1

gao3rfy,t1_gam8sj2,2020-10-31 03:41:53,MensRights,"Men should not be forced to interact with people who have the levels of in-group bias women have.

It is entitlement to say men should mentor women simply because if men don't, womens careers will suffer. Maybe if that is the case, women should become more appealing mentorees instead.

On treating them the same, that's largely the point. Womens in group bias and warped perspective makes that impossible and they often refuse to come to terms with this. There's studies out there showing women perceive a lack of favoritism for women as hostility to women. They are literally not capable of understanding what equality looks like.

(As an example, if you gave both a man and a woman 5 dollars, the woman would see this as misogyny. Rarely would they in such a blatant example because the cognitive dissonance would be too great even for them. But that gives you the idea. Instead, the woman would expect 7 dollars to the mans 3, and she genuinely believes this is equal treatment. This attitude pervades all their interactions with men because it has not been confronted and because women are willfully ignorant of it by clinging to feminism).

So if you want ""Men and women treated the same""? That's what is happening. Men would not want to associate with or mentor men who behave the way women do.

Insisting men mentor women anyway and ignore all this is yet another example of women demanding they face no consequences for their behavior.

Suppose we forced women to mentor men who were just openly misogynistic all the time and threatened to fire the woman if she didn't. That would be what we call a ""Hostile work environment"" now wouldn't it, and it would be something they could sue the company over.

It is unreasonable to expect men to tolerate a hostile work environment merely because women need them to tolerate it or they'll be worse off. If women are capable of changing, they should change and become better people so that men will associate with them again. If women aren't capable of changing, that's a big can of worms to open.

But we won't know until we start punishing women for behaving this way, and one way of doing that is to harm their careers.

The level of normalized misandry and gynocentrism in women makes associating with them a toxic environment for men. We should not be forced to do it in the workplace, and that is why men are opting out of doing so.",azazelcrowley,t2_eu1ns,2,0,reddit1

This is a typical expression of gynocentrism that deflects criticism away from women, as usual, and thus ensures they never improve. 
You're also taking an outlier and applying it to men, whereas I am discussing a fault with women as a group where the fault is the norm, and the positive exception is the outlier.

It's you acting like ""This jar contains pure alcohol and one drop of water, and is thus equivalent to the jar that contains pure water and a drop of alcohol."".

Finally it ignores that one major reason for mens violence is the lack of societal and institutitonal support for them, whereas the reason for womens in-group bias and entitled attitudes is decades of supremacist propoganda.

> And, the research on women's in group bias that I've seen is old and hasn't been replicated that I know of. I've looked for it.

It's been replicated dozens of times, but I was referring also to the study by Amy Yeung.

> If the work environment mentors people, then the people that work there need to be mentored. End of. How do you mentor the men and not mentor any of the women?

Quite simply. By recognizing you do not have to subject yourself to a toxic workplace environment.

> But it should be able to be done in a way that leaves all employees feeling safe. That's not impossible.

Let me know when women are being instructed on how to be better MRAs and taking it on board instead of lashing out about it.

> There are going to be men who don't think a vagina makes a person duplicitous. They can mentor.

I wouldn't exactly call it duplicity, that would require conscious intent, but i'll address your overall thrust;
More fool them. It's precisely the treatment of these kind of men that leads others to abandon this position over time and the isolating of women in the workplace to be normalized. It does not take long for men to figure out that women telling men ""Treat me like an equal"" is not what women actually want, but that they want special treatment and concessions, and not only that, but are vitriolically hostile to it being noted and pointed out. As such, women will be mentored only by men willing to adhere to those demands and subject themselves to a toxic workplace environment, as well as men who mistakenly believe women want to be treated equally and who then face hostility and possible litigious behavior from women convinced they are being discriminated against when that man actually does treat them like an equal. (Again, see the Yeung study).

> It would be an excellent reason to promote more women, so there will be female mentors available.

What makes you think men would be keen on having more women as bosses if they're toxic enough that even having them as employees is a burden?

Because it would be good for women? Why should men care? ""White supremacists don't have enough of the economy under their control, we need to be nicer to them and help them out more."". Um... No? This is the entitled attitude i'm talking about. You seem unwilling to consider that perhaps women simply don't deserve the thing you're asking because of how women think and behave. You are not owed solidarity when you offer none in return.

> But if the company discriminates, I support the women that work there taking them to the cleaners.

You're failing to deal with the point that women outright expect discrimination in their favor and are not capable of understanding that equal treatment is not discrimination against them. We've studied it. As I said, you're being treated equally. If men behaved the way women do, men would not mentor men either. That's not discrimination. It would be discrimination to say ""Well because it's a woman doing it, I should ignore it."".

> And, please, you don't seem to like or respect women very much. So, kindly keep yourself safe by not ever mentoring or supervising any woman.

This is an example of what i'm talking about. You are not capable of understanding that not receiving preferential treatment in your favor is not the same as treating you unfairly. You should read the Yeung study, it might make you question why you assumed I don't like or respect women, because that's exactly what the study lays out, that when women receive the same treatment as men, they think that means the person doesn't respect them and hates them.",azazelcrowley,t2_eu1ns,2,0,reddit1

They have this twisted, distorted world view is due to one of two possible ways of growing up. One being with not a-lot of hard-ship and being told fairy tales about how the world should be through movies, cartoons, etc. The second one being the opposite, growing up in minor to moderate hardship (example being growing up with only one parent, possibly with a couple other siblings and never turning to crime and struggling occasionally with things that life throws at you, which makes the person believe that they should 'get a break' when it comes to work, also mostly due to the media that's been popularized thanks to ""The American Dream"". Granted both of these childhood varients might not give a person this twisted world view, but there's a chance of it. This lack of hardship that might break  a weaker person creates the world view that everything should be handed to them on a silver platter because either A) ""THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE! THAT'S HOW IT'S BEEN ALL MY LIFE!"" or B) ""I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING ALL MY LIFE, NEVERMIND THE PERSON STARVING ON THE STREET, THE PERSON WITH HEALTH ISSUES THAT MAKE HAVING A NORMAL LIFE MUCH HARDER, I'VE SUFFERED ENOUGH!

""In Study 1, I manipulated the target’s gender and responses on a
subscale of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (high HS, low HS, high BS, or low BS). The low BS male
target (compared to high BS male target) was judged to be higher on HS, less supportive of female
professionals, less good of father and husband, and more likely to perpetrate domestic violence. Ratings
of the low BS male target were as equally negative as those of the high HS male target.  ""

I.E, if you go around saying women are outright inferior and stupid, but give them preferential treatment on the basis of them being ""Useless"" and ""Needing"" it, women will think you are equally sexist to someone who actually treats women like equals. Because what women *think* equality is, is receiving a bunch of privileges and special treatment while being praised for it instead of denigrated.

(See principle-agent games to understand why. The distance between equal treatment and what women want (privilege) is equal to the distance between what women want (privilege) and hostile patriarchal attitudes. From their standpoint of wanting 0, there is a difference of 1 in both directions, so they cannot perceive a difference. Women, acting as principle, judge both egalitarian and traditionalist men as equally bad for their desired goal, which is retaining sexism against men and female privilege while removing any of the downsides.).

Womens brains have been completely fried by decades of gynocentric propoganda on the topic and their perspective is completely broken.

if they don't listen to reason, as a young child like you mentioned might not, if they bite you, you don't play with them for a bit, they can't watch the TV or whatever they want to do.

Pretty simple to illustrate that if they do that they get reprimanded and then things they don't like (that dont have to be biting) happen.

Kids are fairly smart and by 3-4 years old they can understand that if someone they do was done to them, especially if it has happened in the past, and they didn't like it maybe they shouldn't do that to others.

I really dont think women are like children tho, I think some people male and female can completely disassociate from the impact of their actions which is what you are alluding to here, but dont follow the radical feminist logic of, one person of x gender did something bad so now all 4 billion of them are bad.",aboi142,t2_4j4cwaeg,0,0,reddit1

gaq5o9p,t1_gapku39,2020-10-31 19:40:38,MensRights,"Your premise seems to be that all women are equally fried. All women experience in group bias. So for some combination of these reasons, you are going to treat women radically differently than you treat men in the work place. You are saying this is equality, because if men were acting similarly badly you would respond to men the exact same way. In addition, women are going to respond to discrimination as though it’s discrimination but they will be wrong. Because it’s actually their being treated as equals for once. Do I have this right?  

Having in group bias is not the same as having out group hostility.  

And I think you show bias yourself. Women are all equally fried. But men don’t all share some of the characteristics that lead men to overwhelmingly commit violence. Each man is a unique individual who has reasons for his acting out. Whereas for women it’s their nature. 

And, this reminds me of an essay I recently read. Where in certain areas, men are seen as bumbling their way into unfortunate circumstances while women scheme and plot. Headlines of a recent case in the UK. He didn’t mean to strangle her, it just happened while he was trying to pull her out of a car. Whereas the headlines noted, she was going to inform his wife about their affair. This “provocation” reduced the charge to manslaughter. 

So he fumbles his way into murdering someone, she was scheming to get him in trouble. Which on some level justified his response. What happened wasn’t a “kerfuffle”. 

So we all have to be aware of biases and tropes that influence our thinking. 

As for the rest, of you are the boss or work in a place that doesn’t care, treat women however the hell you want. I doubt many leaders are going to be dumb enough to allow easily proven blatant discrimination in the workplace. So I’m not worried about the venting that’s going on.

That's good. I'm fairly skeptical you'd have handled it well, but it's a step in the right direction from the sounds of it. 

> I’d like men and women to trust and care about each other. 

That would be nice, but it's not within men's power to force women to care about them, and it's not in womens interests to do so because they are a privileged class and beginning to do so would undermine that privilege. The solution is to make womens attempts to retain privilege harm them more than it benefits them, and that's necessarily a hostile stance that involves things like economic boycotts, social derision, isolation in the workplace, not supporting things like Roe V Wade unless LPS is packaged with it, and so on. There has been no liberation movement that didn't adopt that stance prior to succeeding, and recognizing it means recognizing that ""Yes, we are here to hurt women and make their lives worse until they give up their privileges. Once they do, we can begin to forgive them."" is a necessary component of the movement. That is not an atmosphere trust can arise from. The opportunity for women to be decent people has been there for decades and they have refused it at every opportunity, and the manner in which men achieve their liberation is not for women to decide on the basis of what they would prefer.

The civil rights movement, anti-colonial movements and so on were similar. Because womens interactions with men are based on exploitation of men, men should seek to turn those interactions into net losses for women until women capitulate. When the cost of attempting to secure their privilege is higher than the benefits of it, they'll change, and not before hand. It's not a matter of ""We can both have it all"". It's a matter of ""If you insist on stationing troops in our country to force us to extract resources for you, we're going to sabotage the shipments, and those troops still need paying. You'll also need to pay more of them to keep order soon"". That's how Empires fall.

Your cooperative attitude is not one that has ever worked and won't work here because our interests are fundamentally at odds. Women will not benefit from equality, they will substantially lose out. So they have convinced themselves of a bunch of nonsense to try and avoid feeling like awful people for upholding the status quo and entrenching it. Again, the solution is to make retaining their privileges even more costly to them than equality would be, and again, that necessitates hostile actions aimed at worsening their wellbeing, status, and material incomes. 

They call this ""Anti-woman"". In some sense they're right, but that's a separate matter from it being unjust or unequal, they have merely fried themselves with decades of nonsense into not understanding the difference, and because they feel that hostility to women means a thing cannot possibly be good for society or produce good outcomes, as they are largely self-absorbed and gynocentric. ""If it's not good for us, it can't be good for society"" and so on. This is why your cooperative attitude fails. You want us to find a solution that is good for both women and men. There is no such solution. The only trajectory for women is down. That's the consequence of building your livelihoods on exploitation of others and privilege. So attempting to find a ""Solution that works for both of us"" isn't going to work. There is no ""I know we've stolen half of your money, but let's figure out a way for us to both benefit from this situation."".

There's only ""No, you give it back to me, or I shoot you and take all of it."". Women aren't prepared to handle that both because it squarely places the moral blame for their own behavior on their shoulders and they are psychologically incapable of it after having their whole identities based on victimhood, and because it makes them worse off materially (As as I said, they've convinced themselves that these facts alone are enough to say something is evil, because they are selfish) And yet, it is the only way mens liberation can be achieved.

This is seperate from some women accepting this and helping men achieve that goal, however. Some do because they place more value in being a good person than having material and social benefits. That will always be a minority of any privileged class however. The compulsion they have to ""find some way for us both to benefit from this me mugging you situation"" is too strong. It produces farcical self-serving delusions like the white mans burden for colonialism, and feminism for women, lies the exploiting class tell themselves about how their abuses and injustices are for their victims benefit.

I also put it to you that even if a cooperative approach *could* work, men are under no obligation to utilize it (see the Imperial Federation for a colonial example), but women *are* under an obligation to acquiesce to whatever approach men do decide to take. If it is the case that men are now just sick of women and don't like them very much, it's your job to cope with that and nonetheless end the injustices you're doing to men rather than continuing to do them while you try and convince men that if they liked you more the injustices would stop.

If it turns out that the world post liberation is a lot colder and there's less good feelings between the sexes, but still equality, that's an improvement nonetheless and still a victory for mens liberation. We're not required to be your partners if we want a divorce, and if men decide to hate you, you have to cope with that rather than locking them in the basement. You are not entitled to our approval or friendship. We *are* entitled to justice. That can be difficult to come to terms with, i'm aware, but it's still the truth. Ignoring it is just another in the long line of examples of women wanting to avoid responsibility for their own behavior and avoid any negative consequences that arise from it boiled down to a facile example of it; ""Just because i've been an asshole for 50 years, doesn't mean you should dislike me and want a divorce. You're not allowed to dislike me, it makes you a bad person."".

You did concede that men have a right to be angry and it's good, so I should think this would be something you can understand. I'd point out though that i'm not angry, i've moved passed anger into indifference.

This is largely because the values society has have shifted considerably. The attempt at equity (rather than equality) traditionalism provided fulfilled the needs and desires of both sexes for most of human history until the values people held shifted. It's not a matter of women resisting and suffering under the yoke for thousands of years like feminists would have you believe. Once the values changed, it didn't take long for women to demand change and for it to be provided. Meanwhile, men have been demanding change and been ignored. 

You're imagining men lack womens resilience because you're imagining a history that doesn't exist, where women put up with unfair treatment for a thousand years before finally having enough of it, but men can't handle even a few decades of it. The former part of that is based on assuming women in history were basically similar to women today as opposed to having fundamentally different values, chiefly wanting security, stability and so on, and with less use for freedom, equality, self-sufficiency, etc. They weren't suffering under traditionalism, they were supporting it and helping to define how it should look. There are still women with that value set working to try and enforce it. Feminists delude themselves that such women are agents of men or brainwashed as opposed to independent persons with their own preferences and agenda, because to recognize the latter means recognizing there was no ""Oppression"" of women.

Compare/Contrast the one-sided behavior of feminists and the dirth of male support for their agenda.

Using the vote as an example, the reason women didn't have it is that they didn't want it. Not because men were keeping it from them. When women demanded it, they got it, because traditionalism relied on support for an equitable partnership. This reliance on equity has been exploited by feminists to push their demands further and further to the point that mens support has collapsed, and as such I am contending we need to behave more like feminists in order to adjust to the new dynamic rather than continue to hold an equitable view.

You claim you want men and women to work together to come to some form of agreement. What you fail to understand is, that's what traditionalism was. A new agreement based on equality rather than equity would look considerably different to be sure, but that goal has been largely made impossible by the behavior of feminists and the aforementioned ""Nowhere to go for women but down"" issue. 

By turning gender into a conflict, women have placed men into a position where they have no real choice in the matter if they want to be treated fairly but to fight back. You have managed to ""play us like a fiddle"" because many men don't want gender to be a conflict, but it is one anyway. I think this is also revealing of a repugnant mentality of yours that i'd draw comparisons to the appeasement era to. You seem to think that attempts to appease an aggressor make the aggressor strong and the appeaser weak, and that can be a valid view, but it's not a matter of ""Playing them like a fiddle"" more so than one side being drunk on belligerence and the other wishing to avoid conflict. Eventually though, that mentality gets you to a Danzig situation.

> Meanwhile, women are playing society like a fiddle, and you all just can't pull it together.

Well it's good of you to admit it. And as I said, the way to pull it together is to stop trying to appeal to womens reason, understand their interests are fundamentally at odds with ours, that we should stop appeasing their demands and instead accept we are in conflict with them, and so on.

> So, suddenly biology is unfair? Tell me why I should break female solidarity to to stump for LPS instead of laughing my ass off.

I mean, it's good of you to admit you don't care about men or equality.

> I don't think you have any weight to throw around, quite frankly, and have nothing to threaten women with.

And yet you're whining about measures like the OP. What you're not understanding is that your refusal to help us is the status quo, it's not a net loss for us. But if we decide to refuse to help and cooperate with you in return, that causes a considerable loss for you. I'd also note that you claiming we ""have no weight to throw around"" is an admission by you that we lack power under the current dynamic that women have. You also seem to be assuming that mens rights will (or should) be the only civil rights movement in history without a violent contingent, and women should be the only oppressor class in history against whom violent action doesn't occur. Which is folly.

Regardless of mens situation, we still have our bodies to throw around. Even Slaves had something to threaten masters with, and men have more than that. An inevitable consequence of growing consciousness of mens situation and womens complicity and exploitation of it is that some men will decide to use violent means to rectify it, especially if women begin replying in the fashion you have here to the dynamic being noted plainly and honestly. Nothing quite like ""We know we're exploiting you, we're not going to listen to reason, and there's nothing you can do about it"" to convince someone to pick up a pitchfork.

In addition, currently men earn more money than women, but women spend 80% of all money. This causes corporations to skew heavily into pandering to womens mentalities and perspectives, which as we mentioned are misandrist, gynocentric, and so on. A simple action men can take is to simply not allow women to spend their money and to spend it themselves. Transferring that money back to men would mean corporations would have to immediately backpeddle on their pandering to womens delusions of superiority to try and convince them to buy products. This would impact the media we consume and the advertising we see, the initiatives corporations undergo to win good-guy points, and so on. 

There is *plenty* men can do. They just need to be convinced of the dynamic, and they will draw their own conclusions on how to proceed.

> I've made it pretty clear I mean illegal discrimination.

Here's the thing. Words and discrimination require interpretation. If it becomes the norm for men to see nothing wrong with doing this, then that's how they'll interpret it in union tribunals, as judges, and on juries.

> There's no supporting or not supporting a Supreme Court decision. There's only voting parties in that will or won't appoint pro choice judges to the court. That roe v wade is a wedge issue that's been used for political posturing has been going on for decades. Nothing new under the sun.

There's a reason for protesting in support of it, and a reason a lack of male support for those protests would have an impact on their efficacy. Men are aware this is the case because we have experienced the lack of female support for male liberation and how that renders it almost impossible. In many ways the threat to Roe V Wade is emblamatic of the collapse of support for womens issues among the male populace as a result of men coming to terms with the conflict. Your current status and privilege was built upon our cooperation, and if we rescind it, it comes under threat. We don't need to be hostile to roe v wade, we simply have to no longer care about it, and it becomes considerably more at risk from those who seek to overturn it, because they can offer us one cent more than you offer us to achieve their goals and we'll back them on it. This also has the advantage of a forcing a bidding war for mens support. If you want us to back you, give us more of what we want than the people who are your enemies, pretty simple. You can no longer expect appeals to ""being fair to you"" to work, because you have pissed away any good will you had left by refusing to accept that argument when men made it.

A rollback on womens status has basically already begun as a result of womens alienation of male support and their lack of understanding what a growing number of men realize about the dynamic in place. You seem to think just shouting about how you need abortions to be treated fairly will work, because it has in the past, and don't understand men have concluded (rightly) that you aren't interested in fair treatment as a standard, only maximizing your own interests while ignoring mens (See again those studies.), and so men should understand you waffling about fairness not to be a moral argument we should entertain on the basis of a just society, but a plain statement of your own interests. We do not share those interests. Find a different argument, or pay us in what we want.

This is why there's ""Nowhere to go but down."". You need our support. Until now you have had it for free because you felt entitled to it and conflated justice with receiving it, despite not giving it in return. Less men are buying that. A simple game theory example would be the dictator game.

You have demanded 10 dollars and offered 0 continuously while demanding we accept the offer, and we have been. If men begin to reject that offer (Which in the game, forces both players to have 0 points), you are forced to offer at least 9 and 1. Even though this is not equality, it is a worsening of your circumstances and a bettering of mens. 

Your entire attitude seems reliant on the idea that if men withdraw support, women can do so too. You have fundamentally misunderstood the dynamic. You're already not giving us support. Your enmity is not new to us and the open expression of it will only galvanize opposition to you, as I pointed out. One might even say that;

No, women fought for what they got.  Do you think women asked nicely to be free of harassment at work?  And all the men had a moment of clarity, and decided that it wasn't hilarious to grab a secretaries ass?  No women sued.

Women don't only have free agency when they are choosing to follow traditional values.  All women, whether they marry a red pill dude, or become lesbian separatist, are making their choices.  

> When women demanded it, they got it, because traditionalism relied on support for an equitable partnership.

Yes, they just snapped their fingers and it happened.  Leaving aside being force fed in prison and throwing oneself under the king's horse.

> What you fail to understand is, that's what traditionalism was.

An agreement is entered into when everyone has equal power and equal options.  Now, I'm not one to say all family was patriarchal and bad.  That's ridiculous.  When it works, it's from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.  

Some of your stuff I don't know where to begin with, frankly

> In addition, currently men earn more money than women, but women spend 80% of all money. This causes corporations to skew heavily into pandering to womens mentalities and perspectives, which as we mentioned are misandrist, gynocentric, and so on. A simple action men can take is to simply not allow women to spend their money and to spend it themselves.

Sure, start taking over the chore of going to the grocery store and being responsible for buying for a family.  I mean you could choose to spend it yourself, but women don't do that with the money.  Why the hell do you think it just so happens women spend 80% of a family's income anyway.  And if she works, it's not ""his"" money.

> Here's the thing. Words and discrimination require interpretation. If it becomes the norm for men to see nothing wrong with doing this, then that's how they'll interpret it in union tribunals, as judges, and on juries.

Yes, there's backlash in place but I don't think it's coming from where you think it's coming. It's coming from the far left, who are as misogynist as any on the right.

You all need women too.  You have no solidarity or in group caring.  You have empathy for women but not each other.  You kill yourselves and each other. You send each other off to die in stupid pointless wars.  Men send other men down to die in the mines.

You ask us where your march is.  You ask us when international men's day is, even though it's the same day it is every damn year and you all don't do a thing for it.  If women try to address men's issues, all we hear is pissing and moaning about how we're castrating harpies putting masculinity in a bad light.  So do it yourselves.

You have all the wealth and almost all the power.  Things got this way under your watch.  When NCFM sued about the selective service, they had the support of NOW.

I have wondered if MRA would be better served by sperating MRA from the criqtiquing of feminism as technically they arent even the same thing.

And the draft is much less relevant than you make it out to be, because women never served in front-line roles in significant numbers, and they won't start now.

Yeah, if you are hoping that a men's right's movement is going to come from the left, that's a sucky place to be in.  I hate men's lib because they are so condescending to the guys who come there with problems.  It's not a liberation movement's place to educate people about how they are supposed to look at their problems, it's to center the actual problems and center the people who have the problems.

Nah, this is the trope since Eve was written into the bible that women are sneaky and underhanded.  We couldn't possibly have just made our case in the courts and before the public and won in the marketplace of ideas.

You keep thinking in blank slate ways. The fact is, women have a stronger in-group bias for their own sex, and it's probably biological. Men won't change themselves to be women so that you won't have to tackle hard moral questions.

(Bonus points, feminist theory keeps pushing this blank slate view of human nature that keeps you and other women from even noticing your own biases.)

> We couldn't possibly have just made our case in the courts and before the public and won in the marketplace of ideas. 

You could have, but you didn't. Read about Sokal Squared, for starters. A lot of bell hooks reads like Adolf Hitler, which is not unusual. And a lot of the so-called feminist scholarship is emotionally evocative unrigorous garbage, and it is now fortunately coming out as such. (Your ""trope"" would fit right there.)

> I'll support any org. that's helping men. I'd like more men to being doing things to help each other.

You'll pinch pennies together for men all the while playing a hand in maintaining an unjust system of power that keeps already-available billions away from the most vulnerable of us? You are so generous, lemme go fetch my pedestal. If only people who run soup kitchens didn't have to vote intelligently, or support just laws. (Would you be OK with me giving $1000 for charity and then voting Trump forever?)

EDIT:

> ...I don't need to care.

So you will care, but you will also never permit the society to think about issues affecting men systemically on non-feminist terms? No thanks, I'd rather live in a world defined by someone who doesn't care, as long as they aren't quite so blind.

> Why bullshit cuz you think it makes you look better?

The basic problem with arguing that ""discrimination A"" is justified by thousands of years of ""discrimination B"" is that there are an infinite number of ""historical injustices"" in the historical record. Within the living memory of most of the people on this forum, blacks and gays were discriminated against. In the 1940s, Japanese-Americans were rounded up and put into prison camps. Way back when, Native Americans were systematically destroyed. Even further back, native peoples of Siberia were conquered and marginalized by Russian settlers. Even further back, the Anglo-Saxons systematically wiped out the native Celts of England, and the Romans did the same...on and on, all the way back to prehistory. An infinite number of historical injustices.

So who gets to pick and choose which ones should be corrected? Choose any one of them, and an argument can be made that they should be rectified. It's an arbitrary decision, whichever one you choose.

Regrettably, some people think they've figured this all out for us. They tend to lump every male into the category of ""historical oppressor"" and every female, person of color, differently-abled person, every nonchristian, every gay or bisexual person into the category of ""oppressed"". It helps them to ignore certain inconvenient historical details that could undermine the idea that all men are bad and all women are victims. 

Yes there WAS a Ku Klux Klan women's auxiliary. Yes women nobility in Europe and the Americas DID own slaves. Yes there WERE women camp guards in Nazi Germany. Yes Victorian white women are just as culpable for what was done to Native Americans, Africans and Aboriginal Australians as white men are.

The principle of equal rights and opportunity for all shouldn't be based on the ""historical record"", because the historical record is a dog's breakfast. IMHO, it SHOULD be based on the principle that today, here, right NOW, all human beings are equal, regardless of whatever happened in the past.

crnil9z,t1_crnge0a,2015-05-28 11:10:13,MensRights,"No, women were not oppressed, women were protected and coddled. Women always had easier lives then their husbands. When people complain about how women were oppressed you're talking about a man who risks his life and health in a coal mine to pay for a wife who works in her kitchen. The idea is ridiculously narrow minded and shows no grasp of actual history. If you look at the progression of society you see that women chose to work less as quality of life increases. Go back far enough and women are in service, or working in fields. A few decades later they are housewives being paid for.

*All* women have been able to vote since 1928, just 10 years later than *all* men in 1918. Those men got the vote for fighting in the war, the women for working in the factories. For 100 years before that it was related to owning property. The required value of property gradually dropped over time so that 40% of men could vote in 1884. For all of history before this period, nobody voted on anything. The voting thing is a blip in history and yet you never hear about that. Those ten years are treated like they stretch back to people living in caves.

You might bring up that women had few legal rights, thats true because they also had few legal responsibilities. Men were held responsible for women throughout history, if a wife committed fraud, the husband would go to jail. This still applies now, although its less explicit, and feminists try to reinforce that position as much as possible. The rhetoric is frequently that women need protection and cannot be held responsible for their crimes but men can. Feminism is traditionalist, it is regressive, the MRM wants actual change.",baskandpurr,t2_8oyrl,5,0,reddit2
crnpwj0,t1_crnge0a,2015-05-28 15:30:04,MensRights,"1928 actually 

10 years after universal male suffrage was granted. At the end of WW1

Price that men had to pay to get suffrage - 1m dead.

Price that women had to pay to get suffrage - A lot of bitching, and some daft tart throwing herself in front of a horse. 

The universally accepted idea of female oppression thought history is INCREDIBLY revisionist and moronic once you actually think about it.

Yes, throughout most of history women had fewer rights than men. 
But if you consider that lack of rights more troublesome than the backbreaking, dangerous and expendable lives that males lead at the same points in history, while also being held ENTIRELY responsible for the debts and misdeeds of their wives, and compare that to ""oh noes, I can't own property or vote"", I find it very difficult to come to any outright conclusion that women were ever ""oppressed"" compared to men. 

Not among the working classes that's for damn sure.

How is a man in the present responsible for the actions of others from the past? How am I responsible for decisions my great-great grandfather made? I personally refuse to live in guilt for things so far out of my control. If you want to, by all means. 

Let's play for a second that I would feel guilt over the past. I have Native American blood and English blood. So, am I the oppressor or the oppressed?

Now, let's get into a little bit of history. Were you aware that many slave owners taught their slaves to read and write even though it was illegal? Many, if not most slave owners treated their slaves very well. After they gained their freedom, they were free, but for a majority of them life got worse. If you want to look at another group of people that really were mistreated, look at the Irish who drained the swamps in Florida. Or the Chinese who built the railroads.

One last point I would like to present is one that /u/ThePedanticCynic already made but you never responded to. That is the point that affirmative action creates advantages for minorities. The *forced* diversity makes companies hire people that may not be fully qualified, just to keep a number on a spreadsheet within specifications. When you force something like that, everyone loses. I definitely see the value it had 20-25 years ago, but today? It's unnecessary. 

You should look at the demographics for unemployment and college attendance. And one last tidbit for you: [White people won't be the majority for long.](http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/15/news/economy/minority-majority/)

Regardless, I think the general applicability of freedom of speech assumes some things about the nature of the human race. If people were impossible to trick, then it wouldn't matter. 

It also assumes that people are divided exclusively on ideological boundaries. I think this assumption's effect on what free speech means is subtle. That all tension between peoples can be resolved by *either* party changing their mind. 

You don't have to make this assumption going in, but what I think it means is that protected views are not exclusionary. This would apply to almost all speech, ideologies, religions, etc. What it would *not* protect is ideologies that assert the negation (e.g. I hate you not because of something you believe, but because of something you are).

The fact that what she did was wrong and unbecoming to her position and that it was the literal opposite of her job description has already been established and no one here (with a few exceptions) is arguing that. 

Yeah, people who do bad things should be punished, no doubt. But discussing the validity of some charges and typification of criminal conduct does not constitute an act of bias. It is the basis of justice, being sure that she will be punished for something that she did in a  proper way, no more no less.

In my country at least, although I'm pretty sure UK's legal doctrine follows, a threat must make the victim fell threatened, expect something dangerous to happen to them in the future. 
This didn't happen.

But most important, it is a crime that can only be committed against a specific victim so, I'm sure someone will correct me but, broadly speaking, when a threat is uttered in such way it more closely resembles a hate crime than a simple criminal threat.

So what some of us are offering is that it seems unlikely that she can be successfully sued for threats.

As for the hate crime it's a better possibility but I assure you that both her defense lawyers and the accusation lawyers are going to have a handful in proving their points.

The people you would like to silence and are accusing of ""being on her side "" are are just some people with a notion of legal proceedings or just some good common sense, oppinating on the validity of some charges.",Sarmatios,t2_9omk6,1,0,reddit2

I used to work in a place that did live music, as well as club nights. Women were hired as bartenders straight off the street, regardless of whether or not they had experience, whereas men were only hired as gophers, and had to ""work their way up"" to bartender, which was ridiculous in my opinion since a couple of the girls were straight out of high school. I think that only about two guys got to work as bartenders. The rest of us were fetching boxes of booze, lugging huge plastic bags full of ice around the building cleaning the floor whenever anyone spilt drinks, getting sprayed with garbage juice when we were taking the garbage out. It was before smoking in bars was banned, too, so getting burned by morons dancing with their smokes at arms' length was a common occurrence, too. Oh, and the guys had to climb a big-ass ladder to change the sign that displayed the names of the acts. Potentially risking their safety, for minimum wage.

At the end of each night, when the customers had left, the girls were free to hang about, while the guys had to restock all the fridges for the following day. This building was huge, by the way,  about 8 floors, so all of this was a pain in the ass. I'd leave work at 4am stinking of garbage every night.

I think it is true that some women or groups have an agenda or are opportunists. Tbh, if I were raped I might not be so kind towards men (even though I think only a minority of men are creeps and there are women who are too [Epstein/Maxwell]). The squeaky wheel gets the oil. In Buddhist cultures, squeaking is frowned upon btw, which might explain the number of despots they have. Religion is the opium of the people and no state will crack on that (unless there is another competing one around). But I digress.

It is also true that women are the victims of commercialisation (by the same group that use women to weaken men). But I could be wrong. Women can force men to buy more stuff too. The elite has a vested interest in keeping us all very obedient and law (bad law) obiding ... and spending. All these sub rules too, but I digress. Again.",gray-matterz,t2_59nceeu6,3,0,reddit3

If women are doing less emotional / unpaid labour surely that would be moreso shared across the man and the woman? 

In turn meaning the other side also evens out, with a lesser expectation for just the man to act as a *breadwinner* for the family, with a more equal distribution of physical and emotional labour as more general ideas of specific gender roles becomes less apparent 

Or do the implications for one not reach that far to the other side? I just think more equality on one side would sort of force a shift on the other

It’s not a surprise that female beauty standards are toxic, a lot of identity revolves around beauty, something mainly encouraged by corporations to exploit a certain emphasised insecurity. There’s going to be more social / peer pressure surrounding it

Going against a social norm bothers lots of people, not everyone is as confident in themselves as you are expecting them to be, especially for women with the hyper focus on beauty that isn’t as common for men (still present, think of male body image / bigorexia*), specifically looking at hair side of things (haircuts, the sheer number of hair products / ways to change hair moreso available to women)

The issue here is an unhealthy social norm around women having long hair, there’s no need to criticise this or compare it to men. It’s a relatively unique issue women face (again, specific context and coat around for long hair), ridiculing or undermining the prevalence of social expectations and peer pressure doesn’t seem particularly reasonable given the diverse reality of self-esteem and general body image, and all the unique and separate issues men and women face as a result of toxic beauty standards",-Soggy-Potato-,t2_rbmk0wd,4,0,reddit3

Neither’s a great lifestyle but I’ve already met enough women who seemingly have little to offer the world other than their pussy.  I’ve met a lot of men who are too stupid to perform at any job other than manual labor too.  So what’s your fucking point?  A bricklayer’s not gonna wanna wait for a woman who struggles to lift one cinderblock up into a wheelbarrow and take all day to push that fucker up a plank ramp... there’s no way to make a profit when things move that slow.  It’s a job best suited for men and maybe some exceptionally strong women.  So really WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS THREAD?  Just so the OP can cry like a woman about things that neither men or woman can affect?  Human biology is the problem for him?  I’ll take being physically stronger and not bleeding out my ass every month all day long.  There are a lot of issues men face but this isn’t some systemic shit, it’s nature he’s crying about.",FlenZepla,t2_1ltsj0ds,1,0,reddit3

By who, exactly? One could argue the people ""looking down on"" women are other women. When push cones to shove, guys generally don't really give a shit. Again, anecdotal.

Because trans men haven't had testosterone flowing through their system for their entire lives creating denser bones and muscles then transitioning to beat the living shit out of biological men maybe?

Statistics prove that domestic chores are more equally shared (if not still putting more of the ‘fun / engaging’ ones like playing with their kid on the dad and taking care of the ill for the mum

My school’s reasoning was that girls were supposed to have long hair and wear a specific type of white shirt (I honestly can’t remember what it’s called, but it’s not a regular polo shirt like the boys had) with black, yet see-through stockings in the winter and black socks in the summer, while boys were supposed to have short hair, a black polo shirt, and tan khakis. The boys also couldn’t have a beard or mustache for some reason, which was really weird. Bras were also required for the girls in high school even if they weren’t developed or had medical issues with wearing one. I personally preferred to wear one, but the choice should still be given, especially for medical reasons.

It was all based on sexist stereotypes of how young boys and girls should look. I hated wearing skirts, because my underwear would be visible and I’m just not a skirt type of person (I only wear t-shirts and regular jeans). When I got older, I started wearing shorts underneath, though they technically weren’t allowed. The school said that it was because girls need to look modest, but there’s literally a fetish with school girls in short skirts and stockings, so if anything, regular pants and a t-shirt would have been more modest, in my opinion. Even though I wore my skirt at my knees, the wind from outside or sometimes the shutting or opening of a door would blow it up past my waist, which happened to all of the girls I knew, so many times people could see everything.

I can't emit an option when it comes to bras tho, haven't wear one lol so I will take your word on it.

In my school, skirts should be just a bit below the knee, so pretty long ones (I guess), and girls used to wear shorts underneath them, but they were allowed. Don't get why that wouldn't be, in your case.

What I do thought (and still do) was innapropiate (although being a teen, didn't really complain - because everyone would mock me... And hormones), was the girl's sport uniform. Normally it would be the same shirt than us, and normal pants. However, while we got shorts, they had to use really tight shorts, like leggins, but in shorts. They weren't forced to use that during PE, but the ones that did, well, got many obnoxious looks (some did it because it was easier to run, others because they liked the attention,  but I rather don't comment on it).

I agree with you in almost, if not all your points tbh. I didn't like the uniforms, not one bit, and hated using them. However, I can see why they are enforced. Still, I think many should get a revision and be changed.

The main reason why SAHD are not accepted is because of traditional notions that men should be breadwinners, and that caring for kids and the house is the *woman’s job*. Men taking on a traditionally feminine role is *wrong* 

feminist influences that specifically focus on these aspects of family inequality pretty clearly make being a stay at home dad / part time worker as a more valid options. In turn opening more opportunities for men regarding a stronger role in their kids lives and the option for being the primary caregiver

In this specific context, feminism has made lots of progress in jabbing at family gender roles giving both men and women more freedom and independence in how they want to structure their family life, hence why the original idea that equality for one person can lead to equality for the other holds true in this specific case",-Soggy-Potato-,t2_rbmk0wd,2,0,reddit3

gv5584i,t1_gv4ywrn,2021-04-19 23:36:24,MensRights,"I’m suggesting that men taking on a more family oriented and domestic role is as an indirect result of the push for women to become more independent 

Since the two don’t commonly co-exist (woman don’t really work full time and doing all the domestic tasks), the growing independence of women encourages equality on both sides, pushing for women to have the option to work and men have the option to do the domestic / child based role 

The overall family dynamic is more personally crafted in a sense, with general feminist ideas trying to deconstruct the traditional ideas of what men and women should do in the family. People are more free to do what they want, and less shamed for doing so, where men and women can personally decide on the main earner and main domestic worker based around income or personal desires rather than having that dictated by traditional ideas about what each gender *should* be doing 

Sure it generally focuses on women and how gender roles limit women’s opportunity, but even if the intentions don’t line up, the end result *in this context* is that feminist criticisms of gender roles in the family have led to more equality for men and women, in the form of wider tolerance of individual freedoms of choice 

It’s not equal yet, tradition still holds power and SAHD will still face criticism from those who think the domestic lifestyle isn’t for men, but that stance is a decreasing minority, and doesn’t undermine how overall the wider tolerance of doing what the family members individually want has been assisted through general feminist notions 

-

I just generally don’t find it useful to generalise.

I also saw unions running training courses from which *white* men were banned from being white men.

It also failed to enact comparable initiatives to get more men into roles traditionally occupied by women, which it could have done.

Music, especially conducting is a whole lot like academia - you spend your entire adult life 'climbing the ladder' which involves doing things to get funding and get noticed, building relationships and connections and reputations that may not pay off until decades later.  And maybe, just maybe if breaks go your way, you will wind up conducting a big city orchestra.

He was up for a position as conductor for a mid sized orchestra, and he had friends on the committee doing the hiring as well as many of the musicians having worked with him before and being universally respected and liked.  He's very experienced and knowledgeable about the material they would be using.  He's privately told by multiple people that's he the #1 candidate by a good measure.. but the search process takes nearly a year and includes each candidate guest conducting the orchestra.

And along comes a woman in her early 30s - over 20 years younger and 20+ years less experienced than him, but her 'thing' so to speak is her marketing herself as 'lady conductor' and she's really good at making a lot of noise about herself.   She's not incompetent for the position, but objectively less experienced and qualified compared to my brother on nearly all metrics.

I'll spare the long windedness - she was hired in a close contest because 'of the look having ""lady conductor"" brings to the origination'  Lots of musicians and board members are upset over this decision, but that's the way things are now.

This is a comment from 5 fucking years ago, but still 100% relevant today. Here's the most important part:

> The way many women dress today, with half their breasts exposed, is an expression of total disrespect for men. Men are left with three possible responses. To grab the woman, which is illegal; to ogle the woman, which is socially unacceptable; or to affect not to notice the woman at all, which is emasculating. A culture that normalizes such female behavior—i.e. not only not noticing or objecting to it, but prohibiting any objection to it—is extremely sick. 

> Your point that such outrageously provocative dress—which is now all but standard among American women, whether in the office, the gym or anywhere else—is actually disrespectful and demeaning to men, is one that is not made nearly often enough. I think you’ve really hit on it when you say that to pretend not to notice such things is actually emasculating. This touches on the basic fact that men, as men, are ineradicably interested in the sight of semi-denuded women. This is so basic to what men are that to disregard it is an open challenge to his status as a man, forcing him to pretend at being something other than what he is, compelling him to assent by his silence to an obvious lie. It is a companion to the morbidly sick insistence, now spreading in the Netherlands, that men should never urinate in a standing position. Men do not walk around half-naked precisely because it is obscene, and because women are not interested in seeing them dressed that way. For women to pretend there is no sexual component to dressing in ways so revealing that they go far beyond what is even practical or comfortable, is really just a quintessentially feminine, passive-aggressive kind of power play.

Problems with the platform abound, including forcing creators' websites into that Googley-eyed format where the actual url is obfuscated so that a user browsing around has to click it (generating both click revenue and **tracking information** for Google) in order to get to the page, whereas you used to be able to read the url if you wanted and just go there directly without awarding any click revenue.

Like someone else mentioned, she may have serious weight issues or other problems as well since most women don't really wear muumuus.  Regarding the flip flops, I have an overweight male colleague who wears flip flops and pants with elastic. He also tends to wear shirts that billow and aren't tucked in.

It is true that feminism relies solely on the false premise of the apex fallacy, and it is also true that feminism's dishonesty and propaganda have further exacerbated that problem where the bottom 95% of men are completely invisible to our society. However, I would argue that this issue of ""male invisibility/disposability"" has existed for far longer than feminism has, and that its roots run far deeper in our psyches than many might think. So the idea that people ""understand the struggles the average man faces"" is I think where we run into our true adversary. Yes, people can be reasoned into seeing the overall trends and issues that men – as a group – face, and that men have struggled under for centuries. However, they don't or can't function with that mindset at scale, perhaps because we as a society need to generate excess resources, and because we demand sacrifices from large percentages of the population, just in order to balance that ledger called ""survival as a species"". So unless every individual can carry their own weight by becoming completely self-reliant – and by this I mean in every conceivable way, from feeding themselves, to being their own emotional support, to even being able to procreate and raise offspring on their own without the inefficient and dangerous need to gestate offspring within their bodies – then we will always get some stratification socially that pushes significant populations into taking on more burdens and becoming the protector of others who are more vulnerable than them.",RoryTate,t2_ghli7,3,0,reddit2

And the greatest irony of life is that manhood is a performance and it is a perception, and what I mean by that is you could be the smartest or strongest or richest man ever and people will still find something about you to be emasculated or put down with. I don't really believe that people can really send someone's energies to the point where they just bow down to them, the Michael Jordan crying meme is an example of this. Michael Jordan is probably the most well-known basketball player ever and is very rich in influential
 And yet when he cried, something that is considered horrible for a man to do and at the same time our society says that it's okay to do, he was literally made into a meme


I think What hurts the most is that, feminists swear of that man it could be more open and emotional and have a wider range of their expression.

If I'm privileged for being less like to be raped, then women are privileged for being an order of magnitude less likely to end up homeless... and so on...

Patriarchy doesn’t help men or women. That’s the entire point. Patriarchy has everything to do with the bottom 95%. What everybody downvoting at the mere mention of patriarchy in this sub fail to understand is that patriarchy is HARMFUL TO MEN AND WOMEN but when you’re super sensitive and you think you’re a victim all the time you think it’s just an insult directed at all men.

It’s quite hilarious to see MRAs complaining about the patriarchy without even realizing it. For example every single time an MRA cries about the draft that person is crying about THE PATRIARCHY. A man in charge believes that you’re disposable. This isn’t even arguable unless you’re completely indoctrinated. It’s happening right now with Putin. Is he the biggest feminist ever or something?

IMHO, that is a question for the feminists. From what I've seen, the feminist movement denies that this situation even exists and undergoes great mental gymnastics to deny that it exists. They look at the outcomes, the discrepancy between male and female, scream sexism and demand equality while ignoring the basic physiological reasons for the situation.

I don't see many (any?) people in the Men's Rights movement saying that a qualified woman should be denied a position in favour of a less-qualified man.

Well for starters, they get to force a man into a position of indentured servitude who can't even see his own kids.  That's power.   That's *extreme* power.   The power to wield the most violent institution ever created: the state.    

One of the many problems with feminism is that it doesn't recognize female forms of power, or only recognizes female power in particular contexts.   Yet this is absurd: mother nature does not have a political bias.   Women have different forms of power than men.

Both. However, I really detest wide-sweeping general statements like ""the world sees them as"". I see this pop up quite often in political discussions but how can one determine that? I'm sure that *some* people do but I'm also sure that some people don't. Do you tally up opinions on both sides and let the majority rule? Doesn't that discount the opinions of the minority?

None of us want to see those physical requirements lowered for the sake of political correctness or some flawed diversity doctrine. In the end, most of those jobs like that have that requirement so it will save lives (firefighters, soldiers, etc....). Our only complaint is that compromising those requirements will only result in more people being harmed.

The issue that we are having is that there are plenty of high-risk/high-pay jobs out there that do not have a physical requirement. Women are not going for those jobs.

> ""Male disposability everywhere you turn"" (from the post I replied to).

> I recommend you look up Feminism and the Disposable Male

>  If a worker gets hit and dies, there will only be crickets from the womens side

The whole thing just weakens the very valid arguments that the Men's Rights movement does have.

Off topic, but another example I've seen multiple times in this sub is that feminism is causing men to ""go against their stoic instincts"" ^(I wish I could remember which thread I read that in), and ""[Stop telling men to show their emotions](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/5g99iv/stop_telling_men_to_show_their_emotions/)"". However, there is a strong advocacy for more mental health funding for men and to see men as abuse victims etc ^(which I full heartedly agree with) but those things inherently go against this the outcry of ""don't womanize me!"" because they involve showing emotions and being seen as weak/vulnerable ^(which is literally something being rallied against in the above mentioned 300 upvoted thread).

There are so many things that *most* people would say ""well obviously men should be able to xyz"" but it get clouded by a very ""us vs them"" sentiment in this sub - and feminist groups are just as bad, but do you really want to be the people who point and say ""they started it!""

Be effective, not petty.

Great.  How 'bout feminists make them?  Like make the actual signs rather than relying on men and/or third-world sweatshop workers or prisoners (mostly men) to do it for them.  

Also, how 'bout we have an international effort to create parity in the workplace death gap?   It's MUCH larger than the pay gap, which results in part by men working longer hours in more dangerous jobs.  

That's not going to happen and you know exactly why: men are stronger and willing to take more risks to support their families (or are compelled to subsidize their families even when they are denied meaningful contact with their kids).  

I don't think you realize just how incredibly obnoxious it is for these women (and their male ""allies"") sitting in air-conditioned offices to be lecturing working class men about their working habits.

Two entirely different responses will tell you a lot about what sort of employee you are dealing with.

I think the educational system is also getting worse in this respect.

I recall during my early educational experiences, that there used to be exams, where a certain number of questions would require students to go a little above and beyond what they had been taught in class to demonstrate some level of understanding that goes beyond having memorized something. Something that required having to figure out something on your own that you weren't explicitly taught how to do.

As education has become more ""consumer friendly"", it seems like students have become enraged with the entire prospect of being expected to accomplish something they haven't been spoon-fed or explicitly taught. I start hearing complaints about teachers being ""sub-standard"" when exams contain questions that require reasoning not explicitly taught, but that arises from understanding basic principles.  The premise being that a question was asked of the student, but that the instructor was ""sub-standard"" because he or she did not give the student explicit instruction on how to solve a problem that appeared on the exam.  Never mind that being able to reason about things not explicitly taught, was the entire point of the exam question in the first place. Nope. ""Not fair"" ""bad teacher"" they will exclaim.

My coworker is actually a third type. She goes this route, but then still puzzles me anyway.

> As education has become more ""consumer friendly"", it seems like students have become enraged with the entire prospect of being expected to accomplish something they haven't been spoon-fed or explicitly taught.

Exactly. This is perfectly on point. Insecurity is one thing, but unwillingness to learn is something entirely different. My coworker won't make a decision unless someone else justifies *her* choice. She write an email, she passes it on to a coworker to read and correct. She does a task, she pass it on to a coworker to check if ""she did a good job"". She wants to do something, she asks a coworker what they think before saying anything to others...

And when the only person (me) capable of doing a task she can't handle and won't learn how to, refuses to help her, then it's either bashing or drowning. Just an observation: she was willing to bring the issue to the ""nice-boss"" table, not to the other boss who expects her to perform.

True, it is largely the parents and the culture.

But there is some culpability from within the educational community too, because today's parents and culture are yesterday's students.

 It's hard to be certain, but I believe that a large part of the problem arises from uncritical peddling of [""blank slate hypothesis""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa#Science) which leads many to argue, falsely, that there can be no innate differences, and that all differences in capability can be traced back to social circumstances or to education.

Consequently, many of the largest voices within the educational system, over decades, have pushed to create expectations that biggest failures in outcomes can only be due to failures in instruction. That is, when a student fails, it must be because at some step along the way, the student wasn't taught in a fashion that was tailored to the student's learning needs. Which may or may not be true. Consequently, if a child cannot solve a problem, and they were not explicitly taught how to solve the problem, that is by necessity a failure of teaching. So the instruction becomes more and more spoon-fed, continually trying to deflect concerns that instruction is insufficient. Extrapolative thinking and analogy are removed from exercises, and education is reduced to a boring, mundane, and less-than-generalizable exercise in rote memorization and rudimentary aping.

Of course, teachers are intimately familiar with the ground truth on these matters, so the majority probably have some concept of what is really going on, and many do not view it as a positive development.

So bottom line, you are correct, it is students and parents who are largely responsible in the immediate sense. But today's parents are yesterday's students, and it is the educational community and academia that is largely responsible for creating the class of parents who are so aligned with uncritical and PC peddling of [""blank slate thinking""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa#Science).

So while teachers may be more aware of the ground truth, the general social climate that creates these expectations in parents and students, is largely traceable to education.

Note, that I'm not saying that all learning is based on innate capability. I do think it is possible to improve people's capability to think on their own through teaching. But, importantly, teaching people how to think one their own must incorporate some aspect of the trial-by-fire approach, where students learn over years and years through their attempts -- and critically failures -- in thinking on their own. Teaching to think cannot be accomplished in the idealized centrally organized one or two day program where every child is spoon fed every aspect of what they will be expected to do, because doing that removes the entire process of a student's thinking on their own from the education entirely.",MagicTampon,t2_10wa5e,9,0,reddit4

These people as not to be confused with very unpleasant and rude people; they are far more insidious and socially damaging.

I have dealt with 3 such people.  A narcissist-borderline mix, a sociopath and a malignant narcissist. The sociopath got shipped back to where he came from, ie jail.

Fortunately we had a very experienced psychologist on staff who filled me in on all of this.

He probably meant this exchange, which is kind of cold if you think that SHE is actually a good person putting in some effort.

The problem is, SHE wasn't. SHE had wasted tons of hours doing nothing and waiting for others to ""do the job for her or tell her exactly what to do"". Because her usual support-coworker wasn't capable of helping her with this, she once more turned to me.

She played it nice because she needed to be able to say ""I asked Demian nicely so he *has* to help me"". But it's fake nice, and I knew she didn't have any right to push the issue.

The funny thing is, this exchange was a private conversation between me and her. We had another group convo going on at the same time with me, her and her support-coworker. In that convo she had dropped any sign of niceness and was openly telling the other guy, in front of me, that ""I didn't want to help her... he's doing nothing and I'm stuck with this and he won't help...""

I can freely admit that my understanding of the word and concept might be wrong and leave it at that.

As for wilful ignorance sure I guess. I'm not ready to put down the time right now to read the technical literature on the subject necessary to grasp the industry standard definition of the word.

I do want to point out that you yourself talk about 2 definitions the wrong one used by marketing and the correct one which means there is in fact ambiguity as to the meaning of multitasking.",ObjectPretty,t2_7y8e8yza,1,0,reddit1

Not really, there's nothing inexact about the word multitasking and  I'm not sure that the mass brainwashing by the media qualifies as ambiguity.



It's the same with hdd sizes. A company was taken to court in Australia for false advertising for saying, I think it was, ""2GB, that's a massive 2,000MB"", the court found that while that isn't true the public wasn't misled too badly by not saying 2,048MB and let them off. I think the ""massive"" is a big problem as well, there's no small or big 2,048.. ;-)



Anyway that's why we now have any number of websites saying there are two ways of measuring a MB/GB/TB, the binary way(1,024) or the decimal way(1,000). Which is idiotic because hdd only do binary. I think that we've just dumbed down whole generations for no reason other than to make it easier for the advertisers.

Sure and your life will almost certainly not suffer in the slightest... ya just can't tell an engineer that he's wrong about this sorta stuff and not get pushback.. ;-)

Good that you know about ""multistaging in the processor pipeline"" & ""graphics shaders""..",denisc9918,t2_8t1ktxg,1,0,reddit1
