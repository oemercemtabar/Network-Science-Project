In the industry my job is worth $48-98k which is a huge range. 

So when asked about pay during the interview before the offer stage, I give a range  that's 10-20% higher than my current pay.

Then if we make it to the offer stage and it's not higher than my current pay (they're lowballing me by at least 10%), I reject the job offer accordingly.   They couldn't meet my explicitly stated minimum and I'm not going to fight for additional pay that they can frame as a ""favor"". I will not take a step back in my career and if it's not a step forward I may as well stay where I am, barring other circumstances. 

If they offer at least the minimum of the pay range I mentioned during our interview (remember +10% of my current pay) I'm willing to take the job.

Nevertheless, I still don't want to leave anything on the table so I respond with back ""I'm excited for the opportunity. But on the compensation package, can you come back with your best and highest offer?""

My last two positions have been roughly a 27% raise and then a 20% raise (second one coming with double the PTO).  I started my career making very little so I'm clawing back up from that.

go2tyjl,t3_lnrgwl,2021-02-20 02:37:52,TwoXChromosomes," I interviewed for a job title I was massively over qualified for, because the description of duties did _not_ fit the title.  During my interview, we talked about what they were trying to accomplish with the position.  It became clear that they did have an understanding of what _should_ happen, they need to reach out to a consultant firm that can dedicate 4 people on staff with assorted job titles whose average annual salary is 120k-210k for a 6 month project.  And they were hoping to get it done with one person in six months for around 110k.  After getting some background I gave a really brief high-level background of what the project plan would look like, and how many labor hours were going to have to be dedicated to some of the parts, and how much experience that some of those people are going to need.  I explained how they weren't going to meet their timelines or get any of the functionality they were looking for, especially with what they had requested, and what they need to do is send out RFPs to A,B,X,Y and Z companies.  I tried to gently explain that if they wanted something thrown together they could have it, but it would cause many different headaches and inefficiencies in the future and end up costing them more (with specific examples) than what they were trying to save by underbudgeting for the project.

I did get a half-hearted job offer later, but declined.  Shortly after that they removed the posting, and from what I heard didn't fill the temporary position.  I don't know if they went the RFP route with the companies I mentioned, but I'd like to think they rethought about cheaping out on it.",,,32,0,reddit4

With that being said, I remember having a casual conversation with my previous manager and it came up that one of my coworkers and I are around the same age. Now, I know I look young for my age. My coworker looks older for his age. So my previous manager joked that he would've offered my coworker a lower wage if he knew he was around my age but he offered him a higher wage because he thought he was older. So... that has always made me wonder if my previous manager low balled my offer because I look younger. 

I didn't call out the manager at the time because the salary I accepted was still within competitive pay within my industry; this was 4 years ago and water under the bridge. That manager is not around anymore and I don't hold any ill will towards the coworker who still works here.

I've also found that if you know that you're looking for a specific rate, it can also be really good to ask for $10hr more than what you're looking for, for contract, or 20k more than what you're looking for, for salary. That gives people room to talk down your rate without actually reducing the rate you were looking for. A lot of recruiters and hiring managers need to negotiate a lower rate to feel like they did their job, but giving them a little buffer allows them to talk you down to the rate you really wanted.  
Another fun option is just asking for what feels like a truly ridiculous rate and sometimes they'll say ""Oh that's too high, the best we can do is...."" then you can ask for $10hr/20kyr more than what they say is the best.

I‚Äôve held a ton of different jobs in my short 15-20 years in the workforce. I‚Äôve never been turned down a job I was offered an interview for. Now THAT fact is pure luck. 

I wasn‚Äôt over here trying to pretend I know all the answers for every interview in every sector of employment. 

But generally speaking, lying and stressing the hell out will do nothing but hurt you in an interview. 

I like talking to people and learning things. I‚Äôve listened to my bosses and hiring managers bitch about the interview process. I‚Äôve looked up common interviewing tips prior to big job opportunities. If I know someone in the company, I talk to them. If there‚Äôs a pre-screen I talk to them about the interview process and what to expect. 

But a couple things are for certain. No one likes being lied to, and a lot of people are better at picking up on bullshit than you think, they just ignore it. And everyone likes being treated as a human vs a robot you throw stock answers and replies to. 

Feel the room a bit. Get a vibe for how the interviewer is feeling. Crack a small joke or two. Some places hire on culture as much as they do qualifications. 

Canned interview question responses are great, but don‚Äôt deliver them like canned responses. 

Instead of ‚Äúmy biggest flaw is I work too hard‚Äù try something more realistic that says the same thing, is more conversational, and more personal. ‚ÄúHonestly I‚Äôm a bit of a perfectionist. I take a lot of pride in what I do, so sometimes I find myself wasting a lot of time trying to work on little details I should really move on from. But I‚Äôve started doing x, and it‚Äôs helped a lot.‚Äù 

There, you just demonstrated a flaw, while also bragging on multiple good qualities, including self improvement. Bonus points for following up with a question ‚ÄúSo how does your team handle quality vs time frame when it comes to these projects?‚Äù Or however would be most appropriate for your field. 

Take the time to research the company/position and think about the job itself prior to the interview, and these types of thoughtful questions and responses should flow much more easily and less forced/awkward.

Having been in IT since the early 80s...I know exactly what you went through.  So you had a bastard that was screwing with you and you got lucky....let me be honest here, you got lucky that the Lead Developer was on your side. 

You still had to work twice as hard to get shit done, and you didn't get rewarded for it.  Let me say that again because code cutters need this explained if their subroutines aren't written to understand some variables...you worked twice as hard and got no reward.  

This should be a wake up call to you.  (1) Never do extra for no reward....(2) always cover your arse... This idiot took the fall for you this time, next time you may not be so lucky.  

From here on...make sure everyone knows when you arrive.  Always make a big show of leaving, so they know you left on time or later.  That way no one can lie about it.   People were asking you if it was true you were leaving early...they should have known it was not true without asking. 

Next time you have to do extra work...don't do it without first asking what's in it for you.  Don't be aggressive, be assertive.  Say something like...""This is not my responsibility, I am willing to take it on, but it is extra work and extra work deserves something extra."" ....If you keep doing extra work for nothing, that extra work will become your normal work.

fbo8tpx,t3_ee2j5c,2019-12-22 09:48:01,TwoXChromosomes,"I'm glad it worked out for you, but there is one lesson you need to learn and fast. Working hard, working long hours in order to prove your worth to a company MUST be accompanied by regular efforts to inform and sell yourself. There is a big myth many believe that ""your work will sell you"". Your experience shows how dangerous that myth is. It's sheer luck that someone who knew better was looking out for you.

As hard as it is for some to believe MOST bosses do NOT know who works the hardest in a group where the work is shared, because the hardest workers tend to be out of sight working, and out of sight means out of mind. The slackers who don't measure up take the time YOU should be using to sell your work to sell themselves and ingratiate themselves with management.

He would have never become a problem if you knew that YOU were looking out for yourself by regularly often briefly engaging with the higher managers to make it clear how hard you are working and unapologetically take full credit for all the things you are getting done. Without doing that the guy who almost got you fired probably was able to claim credit for all your hard work

Many think ""work socializing"" is wasting time but it's not when you are doing so with your bosses. He caused you so much trouble, because it sounds like you remained silent again hoping your work would prove him wrong. If it weren't for the lead developer who knew your work you would have likely been let go before him.

While that sounds like your ""work spoke for you"" it really didn't. He knew because he worked directly with you. If the developer had not worked directly with you he would have been as uninformed as  the boss was in regard to your work. 

People in your company shouldn't need to have worked with you or be working with you in order to know how hard you work and how much you get done. You should take 30 minutes out of your day to self-promote (albeit in line with your personality. You don't want to come off forced) in order to create a general positive image for yourself that will ensure people know that about you without ever having worked with you. It will immunize you from future assholes like D.",JohnnyinCentralTx,t2_16j458,2,0,reddit1

In one case, I was treated like I was the problem too.  I left that job largely because of that.  The person who was being coached ended up taking things to HR and left after that.  But my boss and I have met socially after that and we're good now.

In the other, I had one official meeting with my boss and the person and then a second with our boss's boss.  But then they seemed to realize I wasn't the problem and thanked me for being so professional and to keep it up.

For anyone who winds up in my position, I would recommend, keep your head up, stay professional and ask your boss for guidance and feedback on what you can do.  Document it in case you need it later, dates, times. And what, if anything, you were supposed to do.

With the job I left, my boss bought it up in my performance review and made improving the relationship with the problem person a goal.  I was already well on  my way out the door at that point.  I was told I was probably getting the job I took when I left, but offer wasn't official yet.  I wrote a rebuttal letter for HR where I outlined what I had done and also documented several incidents with the problem person where her behavior was both incompetent and unprofessional.  Which hadn't been reported to HR yet.  The problem person had gone to HR on me already, but it was kept secret from me.  I thought we had resolved it within the department.

I'm fairly senior in my position.  I don't manage anyone in a HR sense, but I train people and give guidance and feedback in projects and tasks.  I aim to be positive and respectful when I do so.  Because that is what I'd want.  The vast majority of people I've worked with in this capacity have thanked me and mentioned to my bosses how patient and thorough I am and that they appreciate it.

This woman wouldn't listen, would forget things, which I then had to pick up/fix.  She was dismissive of me, rolling her eyes, etc.  She would then complain I wasn't assigning her interesting work.  I normally didn't even assign her things, I did so for one week while a more senior person was on vacation and I'd been told to do so.

In contrast, the way I was treated more recently is a big part of why I stayed there.  I felt like I was treated with respect and dignity and it increased an already positive image I had have of that boss.",exscapegoat,t2_hulnq,1,0,reddit1

My point is simply that the claim that all women should stay home with the kids while all men go off to work is equally ridiculous. 

The ""traditional"" gender roles you mentioned above (women stay home and care for children while men go out and ""put the food on the table"") have only existed for about 150 years - women provide a significant percentage of the food in hunter-gatherer societies and a significant percentage of the labor in agricultural ones, while the average male hunter-gatherer or farmer is going to spend a lot more time with his children than a 9-5 office worker by definition, the hunter-gatherer on downtime between hunts and the farmer because he's not ""going off"" anywhere, he's working from home and more often than not his whole family is going to be out in the fields working with him. 

In short, if you really want to ""trust evolution"" you need to acknowledge that there's roughly 200,000 years of evolutionary precedent for women who want to work and men who want to stay home with the kids, even if this isn't the most common or ""traditional"" arrangement.

You clearly know very little about China besides stereotypes.  Allow me to enlighten you.

Censored internet is pretty shitty, yeah, but more and more people are either fighting against it or just starting up their own webpages.  Also, VPNs to get over the Great Firewall are frequent as heck.  It's a problem, but it's not one the government actually cares about and it's something I see changing in the next 10 to 20 years when the new generation gets into the government.  And while things like blogspot are blocked, there are things like any downloading sites which are not.  My university students in China thought it was barbaric and stupid that in the West we cannot just go out and download any music, movies or programs that we wanted with ease.  So it's not like our internet is completely free either.

The air is terrible, but have you seen pictures of London in their industrial revolution?  Or even the northeastern US?  China is going through their industrial revolution now, and have realized that they're doing wrong and so are working hard to fix it.  Working REALLY FUCKING HARD.  Trains criss-crossing the nation so cars aren't necessary, pretty great public transit, lots of work with renewable energy companies... there's talk that China will phase out of using coal COMPLETELY in the next decade or so. That's an environmental leap that we haven't taken in the West.  And we used to poison our rivers as well.

The two-child thing there isn't recent, it's been a part of the policy for a LOOOONG time.  Basically, there have always been exceptions to the rule.  The One-Child Policy only affects parents who are both of Han ethnicity.  Sure, that's the majority of the Chinese, but if either parent happens to be one of the other 32 ethnicities in China (or even a foreigner) then you can have as many kids as you want.  Furthermore, if you live on a farm, you can have more kids.  If your first child is female, you're allowed to have a second child.  This is not because of special privileges, it's because parents would abort a female child otherwise.  In fact, it is now illegal to find out the sex of your child before it's born because of how many people would abort females.  

If BOTH parents are single-children, then they can have two kids.  Not if the mother is... both parents are required to have no siblings.  Forced abortions is a weird way to put it in a country where abortions are cheap, easy and socially acceptable.  It might sound weird to us in a country like America, but abortions are just not a big deal or seen as morally wrong in China.

The reason that women are properly represented in Chinese government is because when Mao took over and started up this new uber-communist country, he mandated that all women were to take equal part int he work, rewards and punishments.  That's a VERY communist idea: that women are no different than men and should be treated no different.  I've got a million and one problems with how Communism hurt China, but that rule was pretty sweet.

Now I'm going to point out problems with the link there.  First and foremost, I would like to know who wrote it and see some citation.  It's very easy to blog about how you totally saw ""forced abortions"" in a throwaway sentence, but if that's true then I would like to see statistics, numbers, maybe some personal accounts or SOMETHING more official than a fallacy-riddled document.

Secondly, UGH their whole thing on religious rights.  No, there is no discrimination against religion.  I mean... there is against Falun Gong, but that's a more political thing than a general hate on religion, and it's a complex and shitty issue that takes a lot of explanation and I myself don't have all the facts because I wasn't living in China in the 90's when it was all going down and my students didn't know enough to enlighten me.  But other religions can practice how they like.  The only stipulation is that you can't proselytize. You're not allowed to hand out pamphlets, shout on street corners, talk about religion in schools (outside of a purely academic sense) or anything like that.  There are SO MANY churches and synagogues and mosques and temples and whatever you want in China, and of all different languages.  Lots of Chinese people have converted to Christianity.  There's an entire ethnic group that are Muslim (and I can never spell it right but I believe it's Uighyurs?  Something close-ish?)

Churches are also not subject to any tax breaks, and the government monitors all financial records closely.  House-churches are fucking illegal and fucking horrible anyways.  You wanna know why?  Because asshole missionaries from western countries come in and try to brainwash people into joining their religions.  Honestly, nobody in the government would care if you're just running a bible study group with your friends/church members.  Sure, you might be raided but as soon as they can see that it's not weird or cult-y, you're free to go.  However, every year at my university and other schools around the city we would have DOZENS of people coming in with teaching credentials, ready to take care of college kids and saying, ""Oh I have a study group happening at my house, please come if you want to do well in class"" (which of COURSE the students will attend because grades are more important than life in that country) and then just teach straight from the bible and require religious homework.  The person who had my job before me was fired, jailed and then deported because she told her students that she would only pass the ones who joined a church.  *THIS IS A FREQUENT PROBLEM*  And nothing makes me more angry than those religious pieces of shit who hold a student's future and their grades over their head to raise the attendance of church in a country whose culture they don't even understand.  I had to change so many of my students' grades because they were failing the course (and subsequently would have failed the year and been held back) because this fucking teacher didn't see them at church.  My story is not unique.

(oof.  Sorry about the ramble there.)

Sex work is as harshly cracked down on because most prostitutes (in my city anyways) are forced.  We lived near-ish to North Korea and a lot of the massage girls or KTV girls or other workers were NK refugees, or escapees or in the country illegally somehow and forced into brothels.  There may have been some that were awesome and legit and regulated, but the majority of them were just gross and seedy and you could tell the girls were abused.  Drugs are a problem, trafficked women from Russia were a problem, or even promising girls from rural villages a nice job in the city, then confiscating their ID's and forcing them into sex work.  I am a fervent supporter of legalizing prostitution and other sex work, but anybody who has been to these neighborhoods in China to see what the ""big sisters"" are like and complaining that there are crackdowns is just being disingenuous.  

Whatever, I have other problems (and there are some things in there that are correct and horrifying) but I'll stop because I realized I have better things to do than argue with people who shit on China because it's trendy to hate them now.",WadeK,t2_4g2fr,5,0,reddit2

I‚Äôll never forget the women who worked at the abortion clinic who treated me like a friend and daughter, with kindness and mirth. Joking with me and making me feel like a human being. You are an angel. Getting an abortion a decade ago was very scary and isolating.

 I needed therapy to deal with how depressed I felt, not from the abortion (I thank god everyday I got it!) but having to go in secret, the physical pain of it, my ex not understanding how lonely it can be to go to the clinic alone and wait for protesters outside to clear before you get escorted out. 

Even sitting with girls who had been raped ( the girl next to my bed was raped by her bf), and a woman who couldn‚Äôt go through with another baby with her abusive husband, a woman sobbing because she was too late for an abortion, an underage girl there with her angry father-it broke my heart but the workers were so KIND to us.

Thank you so much for the countless women's lives you've been a part of improving, through supporting them to make their own decisions about their future and their families. I would say that it's not a small way that you're fighting back. It's one of the most essential and important ways of fighting back. Women having freedom and autonomy is one of the most important changes our world needs to commit to and get used to. I really believe it's a crucial component of our social evolution as a species.

I also appreciate you saying that you've not seen regret. I feel like women get infantilized in discussions about what the effect of having an abortion will be on us - like the matter is too big for us to make a considered, personal decision over. My experience has been that it's been the men in my life who have poorly thought through impending big decisions or life changes, like moving to another country or choosing to have a period of unemployment. When I've wanted to discuss this with them (because it would affect our life as a couple) to make sure we're planning and rationally thinking things through, they have tended to underestimate how much these changes will affect their emotions, sense of self, way of life and our functioning as a couple. They go ""ah yeah it'll be fine we don't need to discuss this!"" and then the change they chose and orchestrated happens and they fall to pieces because they were blindsided by its impact on them. And it killed me every time, because I foresaw it and it didn't have to be that way...

So yeah. Abortion is a big decision but it is one that most women completely have the cognitive ability and emotional maturity to evaluate. We don't take our bodies, lives and feelings about reproduction for granted, so this shouldn't come as a surprise.",,,7,0,reddit3

Those who are willing to shell out the money and navigate the legal red tape are rarely on the fence about it.

hk5640a,t3_qqxt7i,2021-11-11 00:57:00,TwoXChromosomes,">Interviewing is a skill that requires practice and I‚Äôve been getting better at it, I really noticed the difference that the practice made and felt the excitement in the air with the new crew interview.

This is something so many people, not just women fail to understand. I have a rule to go on at least one interview a year, even if I'm not looking. When I switched over to my current field I took a pay cut, and it was *very* hard to find a job. I went on close to 100 in person interviews, and I can't even imagine how many phone interviews I went on, applications I filled out, etc.

In that process I learned how to interview, and once I got my dream job I made a point to keep interviewing just to hone that skill. I'd sometimes even interview for jobs I wasn't even interested in, or which weren't the jobs I was going for. Just sort of jobs that kind of fit my resume, but which weren't the direction I wanted to take my career, but sure I'll talk to you and interview.

This really forces you to not only hone the skill of interviewing, but to examine what you do, what you're capable of doing, how to talk about it, and then to evaluate what you're worth compared to what people are willing to pay you.

I fully believe that there is still sexism in the work place as it relates to salaries, but I also think that women are less predisposed towards job hopping, interviewing aggressively, and negotiating.

I was just reading in another thread how inflation this year is ~6% and if your annual raise isn't more than or equal to that then you're taking a pay cut. Further in the thread someone mentioned how this is the reason why you hear about new hires making more than someone who has been at a company for 5 years. They aren't paying them more, per se, it's that the employee has been taking a pay cut for 5 years. To get your worth you need to jump around, and know how to interview well, and be interviewing even when you're completely happy with your job.

The best time to look for a new job is right after you get a promotion/raise at your current job. What often happens is you get promoted to something like manager, and they give you a nice ""substantial"" raise but it ends up being towards the bottom of the salary range for manager. So you go interview for manager jobs making the average salary, which is an even bigger raise, and it's the same time. Then in two or three years you start to interview for jobs at the high end of that range, or jobs to be a senior manager at the low end of the range if you don't see yourself getting a promotion.",stiffupperleg,t2_4gu28,2,0,reddit4

>Interviewing is a skill that requires practice

Yes, generally quite so.  And some good/better managers can sometimes figure out when they've got good/great candidate that just doesn't interview all that well ... but alas, some managers aren't so good at that or are having none of that\*.  So, yeah, dang good you've well developed the interviewing skills.  And yes, for most it take at least some fair bit of practice.

And yes, absolutely, more women in traditionally/historically male dominated fields positions is a good/great thing!  I really like to see that.  As a dude who works in a field that, at least historically, has been mostly male dominated (and still typically male majority - but not nearly as much as used to be the case), I really appreciate women in and getting into the field, and want to help/encourage that as much as possible.  And when/where the women are missing - as in significantly underrepresented relative to what their numbers ought be - always makes me sad, as I feel we're missing a whole lot 'o talent and skills that ought be there, and somehow a whole lot 'o opportunities were missed or denied to women/girls, and/or they were generally discouraged or steered away from, or, egad, sometimes even nasty dudes messing things up ... but hopefully we also get rid of the nasty dudes too - no place for 'em - certainly not around anyone they'd be mistreating.

So, yeah, definitely congratulations to you for getting that opportunity you so deserve, and persevering with the hard work and skills to make it there!  Cool!

\*alas, had an excellent candidate ... I'd phone screened the candidate - and they pretty much knocked it out-of-the park.  The got 'em in for in-person interview ... they were a nervous wreck - it was their first in-person interview in over 15 years (they place they'd been at since about forever was going belly up, so their job was going away).  I wanted to give 'em a chance to take a break and relax and restart, or reschedule for another day ... but alas, hiring manager would have none of that.  So we missed out on a great candidate.  :-/",michaelpaoli,t2_jawbp,1,0,reddit4

I owned a landscape company for several years, and the most important things are good boots, hydration and energy. Invest in a quality set of footwear, probably steeltoe/shank -- you don't get a spare pair of feet when these ones get injured. Also invest in good work socks that wick moisture, (**EDIT:** not) 100% cotton. 

For hydration, pack lots of water. What I do is freeze half the bottle overnight and add half the bottle fresh in the morning, then wrap it in a kitchen towel to keep it cool. I also have these neck wraps that I got at a motorcycle shop that you soak in water and tie on. They swell with the water and help keep you cool. 

And finally, protein bars! Fresh fruit and veggies! You are about to be in what might be the best shape of your life, and you're going to get paid to do it. Help your body out by giving it good building blocks and you won't need to spend time in a gym if you don't want to.

I used to work for a cabinet maker. His operation consisted of me and another lady, about 10 years older than me. He used to get shit all the time from other construction companies on-site when we'd do installations. He would quip with ""I've never had a more efficient, hard-working, harmonious shop than now. They come to work on time, sober, and ready to work hard.""

Apparently his last few guys just disappeared for days, showed up drunk/high to work with power equipment, etc.

chs8nzp,t3_26lkz4,2014-05-27 14:45:33,TwoXChromosomes,"Congrats on the job!

I am a Human Resources Manager for a small construction company. It might surprise you to know that currently 50% of the Project Managers we employ are female. 80% of the Project Coordinators are female. We currently have 2 female carpenters, 3 female labourers and one machine operator. Not only do we employ many women, but I've found they flourish in the roles. We have never had any reported incident of harassment. I'm currently developing a plan to promote one of our female PMs into a VP role.

Don't be intimidated by the construction industry or the trades. It's a fulfilling career because you actually get to see the end result of your efforts. You CAN succeed in this industry. Many women before you have. North America is facing a severe trades deficit, and you'll make more money in construction.

chsaosi,t3_26lkz4,2014-05-27 16:04:08,TwoXChromosomes,"Just wanted to throw in a professional observation..

1. I'm in construction management, we build new apartments. I've been doing this for 7 years now starting in 2003. When I first started, you *never* saw women in the field. 

 Fast forward to 2014, I now see many women out in the field. We have two female laborers, and know of many more on other jobsites. I've seen a few others around doing things like drywall, tile setting and of course cleaning. Funny thing about the cleaning, I see the same amount of men doing cleaning as women. Just interesting to see traditional roles being thrown out of the window. Granted, most of the women work alongside their husbands but still.

2. Whatever boots you get, make sure you get your foot properly measured. If you have a Red Wing shoe store nearby, get your foot measured and go from there. Red Wing has many nice pairs of boots. Boots are something you really don't want to save money on. I used to visit Academy(sports store) and just pick up a pair of boots that looked decent. I'd always come home with tendon pain, until I went to Red Wing. I never realized I have wide feet, and my top arch(or something) was high so I was squeezing my fat foot inside a small boot. Danner makes some good boots. I've heard good things about Georgia Boots as well.

During the hottest months, watch how you eat.  You need to load up early in the morning so you're fueled, because eating a big lunch while working hard in the heat can bring on nausea.  When it's really hot I would bring a box of rice milk and just sip on that for protein and carbs, without giving my system anything it had to work hard to digest.

Your brain is the part of your body that is most sensitive to heat.  Keep your brain cool and you'll hold up.  I used to carry a large thermos full of strips of old towels and icewater.  Wrap the strips around your neck, and you'll cool the blood going into your brain.  Change them out frequently.

I run a landscaping business, small so I don't hire many permanent positions. I hire based on the jobs, sometimes my only options are a drug addict or a women looking for some cash. I have hired women before and see no issues with it, admittedly some of the heavier lifting they had issues but so did the 17 year old highschool kid I hired.


If someone is hard working and can work I don't see an issue with hiring them as long as they are respectful and trustworthy, since it is the clients property. 


I have had shitty and good people working for me, both male and female. I have had great people work for me who I have called back more than once, both male and female.

Before this I was a welder and there was a few women, one was my age, young fresh out of highschool, and the other was a seasoned welder. Both fit in quite well at the fab shop and there really wasn't much of an issue from either the males or the females besides the fun poking between those who were good friends.


People are a people inside and out, some male and some female, this world is a place we share. Society is a place we have built together. We are humans, we are equal, yes it is true sadly some do not see women as equal and sadly some do not see men as equal but such is life, all people need to focus on bettering themselves as human beings and helping everyone do the same.

A friend of mine liked gardening and went to work for a small time landscaper. The guy turned out to be sort of marginal as she found out when she was sent out to a couple of jobs where the customers complained about him. I told her she should offer to do those people's work herself. I know it sounds sort of shady, but her employer was really not up to the job. It took some encouragement on my part, but she ended up going into business for herself. 

She told me that there were lots of women who felt happier dealing with another woman. I'm not saying you should try to steal this man's business. I am saying there may be larger opportunities for you down the road if you like the work.   ",pete1729,t2_605ad,3,0,reddit1

Let me tell you, the hours are long, the days unpredictable but boy is it gratifying. Time goes by so quickly, you don't even notice you just worked a 12hour shift without a break! Although bathrooms can be a bit of an issue, most supervisors and clients are understanding. I say you try it out! I found a love in gardening I never knew I had (I've lived in an apartment without a balcony my whole life). 
If you have any worries about being a woman in landscaping, don't. It's becoming a very equal field for both genders now. My supervisor actually prefers to work with women and went out of his way to have his crew be mostly female (he learned everything while working with a mostly female crew before). He's one of the nicest most supportive and hardworking people I've ever met. In fact, everyone (I've met) who works within the Horticulture industry are fucking awesome! 

Don't be afraid of people thinking you're ""manly"" because you have a job that is physically demanding. I used to be a professional model but the shallow industry made me rethink my pursuits. After working 2 months, I'm in the best shape of my life! My ass is so firm.

**EDIT:** 

It is just ""just women celebrating irrelevant things"".  That is far too harsh.  This sub has some excellent discussion, and some excellent resources.  I believe some threads are guilty of my accusations, certainly not all of them.   

 There's also a ""personal gains"" effect in play.

Coincidentally, friday was the first time I've ever been told I couldn't do something based on my gender. I've been working for 10 years and have worked several jobs, all labor intensive. However, my vagina seems to impede my ability to pick up sticks and branches out of a yard... 

It wasn't for a business, or even money. I was volunteering my time to clean my Grandparent (in laws) yard. Several of their trees were struck by lightening over a year ago. The branches were right on top of the kids play area. With the weather getting nice, it just had to be done or else it'd become a nest of ticks and snakes. 

You'd have thought I was trying to put their dog down the way our Grandpa was fighting my help. Eventually my father in law (he was coming to help) showed up and we did the work anyway. 

I know the grandfather is just getting old, and I'm sure he thinks a woman doing work he can't is demeaning for him, but his reaction totally threw me off and hurt my feelings. I've always been the one to reach out and treat him like a person when the rest of the family ignores him or disregards whatever he has to say. 

He apologized after we had finished, but you could tell it was half hearted. I'm not going to hold it against him, and will still treat him like I always have, but his image is always going to be a little tarnished now that I know how he really feels about women. :/",rogue_pineapple,t2_bf0yt,1,0,reddit1

chska6m,t1_chs7xax,2014-05-27 21:40:19,TwoXChromosomes,"Boot salesperson here,

boot's 50% 
fit's 50%

And I think what they mean by shank is a plate. To qualify for the highest level of safety (at least here in Canada) You need both a toe guard and plate that mean crushing/puncture resistance. A shank generally refers to a rigid piece of material that supports the center of your foot.

Composite toe and Plates are preferable as they are generally lighter weight, non conductive, and meet all the same safety requirements. 

Waterproofing: A waterproof/breathable sewn in booty is the only way to go but they do impede breath-ability of the footwear

Style wise -  Hikers are comfortable and lightweight but tend not to last as long as a real boot (Welt sewn, full grain uppers, etc etc)

**Fit: Unlaced, make sure you can fit one finger behind your heel when your foot is pressed all the way forward in the boot. Don't listen to the number on the box - It's a guestimation. It should be firm around the mid part of the foot and the heel should fit like a ball into a socket. Toes should be free to wiggle with no pinching - Leather will stretch, protective toe boxes will not. The lacing: the eyelets should have 1"" - 1"" 3/4 gap across the tongue. Once you walk around in them make sure your heel doesn't slide up and down. Lastly, Use your common sense of comfortable and once you found one you like wear them in the store for 15-20 minutes. The leather will behave differently and you'll get a better idea of how the boots will feel in the long run.

Socks: Look for content and construction. Good padding, fitted to the foot, breathable material (I like a mix of wool, polyester, nylon, pima cotton, rubber/spandex, and/or polypropylene)

Hmmm nobody is forcing you to be here. You say you're a guy, how do you think you can say something has ""nothing to do with a womanly experience"" when you don't know what the ""womanly experience"" is? Please take a little time to think about why you might have this attitude, that you have the knowledge to evaluate what women ""should and should not"" find relevant.

>This isn't ""progress"". Women have been working in landscaping for decades. Those that want to, at least.

I'm not in the trades, but I haven't seen very many female landscapers. Maybe take into consideration that what may be true in your geographical area may not be true in other areas.

And if OP wants to celebrate something mundane, that's her prerogative. You didn't have to read this, you intentionally clicked on it.

> I actually find this post offensive as a man, because implicit in this post is the expectation that a male landscaper would view a female candidate differently than a male.

> Why do you view the asshole men as the norm, when they are not?


Again, I've never applied for a trade job, so I'm not sure whether it's normal for men in the trades to be bigoted. However, most of us have had experiences with men in hiring positions thinking that we're incapable of physical labor, so personally, that's why I'm happy for her. After years of male supervisors taking away my job responsibilities that involve physical work, it's refreshing to hear an account of a guy who seems to not even see gender.

I agree that ""assuming asshole men are the norm"" is sexist. I don't know if we would use the term ""asshole"" here though, that's a bit strong. If he had said ""you sure can lift a lot!"", a lot of us would hear a silent *""for a girl""*, because we've been hearing it our entire lives. I wouldn't have even called him an asshole if that had happened.


We can be happy that he didn't comment on her gender and also not think someone who would is an ""asshole"" at the same time. There are varying shades of attitudes we have towards people who belittle us for our gender, and most don't get as negative as ""asshole"".",lilbluehair,t2_6r51y,8,0,reddit1

Re: landscaping

There is *good* money to be made in that field if you're smart.  Learn everything you can about irrigation and pesticide application.  In my state, having a pesticide applicator' s license means a starting wage of $18 or $20 per hour.  Also, being a woman can open *a lot* of doors for you, once you know your stuff.  Many property managers and board members of HOAs are women.  Several of them have mentioned to me that there are a lot of...shall we say, ""difficult to deal with"" men in landscaping....and dealing with the gals in my company was refreshing.  So capitalize on that shit!

Also, depending on the company/type of landscaping you're doing, remember to save some of that money you get paid during the summer.  Often, times are lean in winter time and it helps to keep the feast/famine aspect of the business in mind.",SavageHenry0311,t2_40ttm,8,0,reddit1

It's sunscreen made with titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide, which physically *deflect *the UV rays (chemical sunscreens with ingredients like oxyenzone, avobenzone, etc mostly absorb the rays before they can reach the skin). It is, unfortunately, the kind of sunblock that tends to leave a white tint on your skin, but if you're at work and getting grimy anyways it shouldn't be a problem lol. 

Look for sunblock with both zinc oxide, as they together block all the UVB and UVA rays. Titanium dioxide doesn't block the full spectrum. You don't have to wait half an hour before going into the sun which is nice. You don't have to reapply as often because it's not a chemical that will eventually absorb all it can absorb. You will still want to reapply every so often anyway just in case you sweat it off or somehow rub it away. ",lurrz,t2_7ronm,2,0,reddit1

>It's not sexist to be pleased that someone disproves the expectations that society and past experience have lead you to anticipate.

It absolutely is unarguably sexist to assume that men will not be interested in hiring women for a landscaping job, which is exactly what this post implies.  Even if it is accurate, it is still sexist (and I strongly believe it isn't accurate, as someone who worked in landscape, with several women, for many years). 

My point is that this sub, and feminism in general, are supposed to be about gender **equality**.  Celebrating a woman getting a landscaping job because she's a woman is not equality.  

If it makes her feel better internally, that is still valuable, and its meaningful societal progress, but to generalize a women getting a landscaping job as some sort of ""progress"" for women en mass is simply downright delusional.

Nobody actually thinks that, unless you visually look extremely obese or anorexic. Then regardless your gender, you do not qualify for jobs that require manual labour.

chsq34p,t1_chs9zt3,2014-05-28 01:22:10,TwoXChromosomes,"I have to agree with this.  It's all about carrying your weight on a team.  I was put on heavy equipment because I wasn't capable of lifting and carrying 150 lbs of steel.  But I could cut with an oxy-acetelyne torch with great steadiness in my hands, and was able to think smarter, not work harder.  

One thing I definitely suggest is to learn how to shovel and use your gardening trowel to the best efficient manner.  Shoveling is more of a scooping motion; when planting flats stick the gardening trowel in, lift the earth about 6"" then put the flat in the hole, pat down, next.  Also lay out the flats prior to scooping. 

I worked with this one older dude, the best on the landscaping team (Nicknamed Papi) and we had mini-contests which we were so organized we always planted our flats far more faster than other 'teams'.  (one of us would lay out, the other would dig/plant).


I couldn't bolt as tight as my male counter parts, but I was able to foresee and anticipate needs and helped my foreman organize projects better.  As long as you contribute, don't be whiny, remember more what you CAN do versus what you cannot do, will carry far.  

The staying sober is also accurate.  Based on my experience with landscapers which now was about 15 years ago is that there is a lot of drug/alcohol abuse.   These guys also knew more about basic criminal law than most lawyers.   Don't let this scare you off because it could be the start of a new career for you to advance easily and maybe an education in landscape architecture.  Just keep clean, rise above, and with men it's okay to call it like you see it.

In having come from a department in which I worked with an all woman team, they usually don't do that and the norm is to be catty and behind backs.  With guys, especially in labor related fields, just call them out.  

My only last suggestion is when you call out someone or a plan, to only do so when you have an alternative that may work out better or save money.  One of my pet peeves is 'that guy' that will try to dictate or hold up a project because ""it won't work"" and when I ask what he has to offer that's better, ""I don't know"" means to me ""shut the fuck up"".

My father always said, if I pay you $50 an hour, you better make me $100.   This is not the case and we're starting to initialize his termination.  It's sad, difficult emotionally, but he's been sat down many times and he's still not adapting and affecting the team too much in a negative capacity not only with time and money, but our reputation. 

When any team member becomes a detriment to a department, it's seen and felt.  Difficult decisions then are made.  ",AwkwardBurritoChick,t2_ai8xs,2,0,reddit1

chsr1he,t1_chs9vuy,2014-05-28 01:56:13,TwoXChromosomes,"Humor, direct humor I find works well.... When I was in landscaping and my colleagues fluent and my limited in Spanish, and apparent they never worked with a woman before I'd simply say ""No mira a mi culito!"".  (Don't look at my ass!) 

This was always a great ground breaker because it addressed the awkwardness of the situation and alleviated by the joke because it was funny and direct. 

The size of a man, based on my previous comments doesn't matter... what does matter is your confidence level and confronting any issue they or you have.   Men are down with that, respect it.  With that always keep your manager/supervisor apprised of any issues, especially via email so it's documented.

Otherwise, go full ovary (balls) to anyone giving you shit and call them out even if they are bigger, stronger, whatever. You're getting paid to do a job, for your expertise so who the fuck are they to question?

The only awkwardness I feel is theirs...and with vendors.  ""Who is this chick, why is she here on this walk through, what does she know"".  And I remain quiet until my Supervisor/Manager says ""AwkwardBurritoChick, please explain..."" and I give my rant or explanation which he gets off on.... and I see their faces change from confusion to respect. And he just smiles....because my nickname is ""on it girl"".

And don't let nicknames like ""girl"" ""Sweetheart"" bother you all too much.  It's actually respectful, even if as women seems condenscending.  To earn any title is a title of respect.

Also I've learned in my new position, if you're in a managerial or supervisor position, which I am in now, always, ALWAYS have cards and always ALWAYS handshake and have card ready.

With handshakes, you'll have two types: 

1.  Handshake firm, eye to eye, have card ready in other hand. Be prepared to have hand crushed and shake hard back.

2. Handshake girly.  The grip will be to take only your finger tips, and is actually more formal.  This is kinda wimpy but accept it because that also means they respect you as a woman and as I said, it's more formal for a man to take only finger tips of a woman for a hand shake, BUT have your card ready in the other hand, and ALWAYS EYE CONTACT.

The firmness and grip will be forgotten and up to the hand shaker....the most important thing is get HIS card and GIVE your card.

Plus, there's more to it than pure strength. If the woman has a good work ethic, but maybe moves a little slower due to being less strong, she should still be a more attractive candidate than the dude who always shows up late and talks shit more than he moves it (manure, that is).

Not all, but from what I've seen, the workers here and a typical woman are a close match physically. Don't take this as racist or hateful, it's just what I see. 

Most jobs out here in the field, especially the back end/finish work don't really need a lot of strength. Actually, I'd say about three-quarter of the jobs don't really require too much heavy lifting and when it does call for it, it's rare. What it does require is a keen eye for detail. I find that what a lot of women may lack, strength, they make up for in detail. That's absolutely crucial when it comes to apartments. Anyone can patch drywall or set tile, but if you can't set it correctly and level, you ain't cutting it. 

I promote an equal work environment for all. I don't care if you're male or female, gay or straight. We have production to get done so we can go to the next job. Can you do the job? If so, lets get it done. That's my attitude. One issue that always comes up in my mind is rape. It's happened on other jobs, luckily not on mine.

Yes, but we're looking at averages here. If the man has no arms, then the woman will work more than him, sure. But usually she won't, so employers are wary of hiring women.

Women lift less; they use more energy to lift the same things. Standing on a ladder and scraping wood at an awkward angle isn't the same sort of strength as bench pressing, but the stronger worker will have a huge advantage. He'll have steadier hands, use less energy, and be less likely to drop something or make a mistake.

I feel like I've been really clear, but I'll try again.  That is expressly not what I'm saying.  Don't twist other's views.   

Nobody could possibly have a problem with being pleased about a lack of sexism.  I'm suggesting that implicit in this post (and many many many others in this sub, but certainly not all), there is an *assumption* that all men are sexist.  That is very different than what you say, and its fairly objectively present here. 

>You also have to consider that as this sub is for a woman's perspective, it's not really cool to come in and say that her emotions are invalid

I at no point claimed the emotions were invalid.  As a premise that doesn't even make sense.  Emotions cannot be invalid.  Please stop twisting what I'm saying.  I'm trying to be polite, but every response is doing what you're doing- taking what I've said and running to conclusions that I never expressed, don't believe in, and never would express. 

In my opinion, it is simply objective fact that a woman getting a landscaping job is not ""progress"".  Like I've said, I worked landscaping for years, and our team was 30% female.   

I truly believe it is detrimental to celebrate something like this as ""progress"".  It works to reinforce an idea that this is something special or new, which it simply isn't.

>That's not what this sub is about, women don't come here to have their posts analysed and picked apart.

I'm honestly not trying to do either of those things.  I read the post, and it very clearly carries sexist implications.  Then a circlejerk follows of reinforcing that, and treating anyone who suggests otherwise like I'm being treated here.  (not by you, I appreciate your response, but by others). 

Its stuff like that, which is contributing to people suggesting TwoX is the female version of The Red Pill, or the anti red pill.  I would hope people here don't like that association.

Yeah and women let them get to them all the damn time.  Who gives a shit about them, let them grow old and die.  You're not gonna change their minds so stop caring so much about them and move on to the people who aren't stuck in the 30's.

This is the problem with this sub, everyone somehow ties anything to gender no matter what.  Went out and had a good day and made some friends? Must carry more weight because you're a female.   Do you not see how celebrating mediocrity just makes things worse?

If she was careful and thoughtful about how things were phrased like you have been in your posts, then I don't think I would have had a problem with it.

But she wasn't, and thus my objection.  Seeing as 3/4 top level responses to her have shared my point of view, I don't think my view is too skewed, but reddit responses may not be the best measure of these things.

She has actually had laser hair removal down there and even if she let it all go would only have a little more than a strip.  When the laser treatment is done you have to let the hair grow out a bit so right before her appointment it was the longest I had seen on her.  Tbh, I actually kind of liked it.  She's not a hairy girl to begin with so it wasn't all that much, but I did like it.  But alas, she didn't care for it and got most of it laser blasted all.

I have PMDD and endometriosis. I'm expected to not only drive 8+ hours a night but also unload my trailer which could be from 15-80 pieces of freight. This includes restocking any freight that was mis-stacked due to the company wanting to shove as much in a trailer as they can. 

I only ever take OTC meds when I'm menstruating as my body quickly adapts to any medication I put in it. But even those are just a small salve on the first day I bleed. I'm still expected to do my duties with a smile and can't snap at anyone there when they become an asshole because ""I'm using periods as an excuse"". All because their significant others either have normal or light periods and don't suffer from cramps so bad that I can barely breathe. 

I've worked there 9 months and only called in once for my pain. Mostly because I was vomiting from it and was suffering from vertigo. I would gladly take both, treat it like any FMLA situation. My work around now is to catch back uo with my primary doctor and have him get me granted leave again like I had a previous job for my anxiety. I had 4 days a month I could just call in and HR/manager couldn't ask why or say anything. 

As a bonus, 2 guys at the terminal have chronic back issues. When they ""hurt"" they can leave or have attitude and no one bats an eye because of the condition. I had a trailer door almost rip my shoulder our of socket because freight weighing about 1200 lbs had fallen against it in transit. I finished unloading and went to the ER to have it checked.

Plus vacation time you're talking about nearly three months paid leave. We aren't anywhere close to achieving half that here. If it were enveloped under medical leave protection, yes you would have to disclose to employers your condition but it would allow you reasonable accommodation. 

It's more than asking for women not to have to smile all the time. It allows for protection from termination for any behavior changes, slowdown of work during ""flare ups"", being able to leave early, take longer breaks when necessary, frequently using the restroom or not being able to lift over certain weights. It would allow women to continue working without risking retaliation for how their cycles effect them. Most women don't always need to take time off but that doesn't mean they don't need protection.

I do think the medical leave, if the effect is that women can take leave if they want to take leave for menstrual reasons, is a good start. 

My partner's work took away the term ""sick leave"" and implemented a blanket ""wellness days"" to replace sick leave where you can take it for any reason no questions asked. They also used to have ""mental health days"" and ""personal days"" in addition to ""sick days"" and now it's all lumped together as ""wellness days"" - about 25days in a year in total I think.

1. If your CEO/company has no method of tracking your performance, no metrics by which to grade you or your team, that is a huge red flag for a lot of reasons. Primarily for you (disregarding how asinine it is from a functional level), that means he/they can come up with any reason at all to discipline/deny compensation/demote/fire you because there are no agreed upon metrics by which you can track and judge your performance. He's basically just admitted to you that the job is a dead end.
2. The fact that he/they aren't willing to discuss coming up with any metrics means that this isn't likely to change.
3. The fact that he is using your WFH/hybrid schedule as a weapon against you and your performance without any actual proof of poor performance is a giant red flag
4. With the job market the way it is, and your skillset what it is along with the title change(who cares if he acknowledges it, you're filling the role and doing the work so just update your resume starting when you took over the role. You don't need their permission.) you should absolutely start looking for a better fit for you and your family.

i6q9yik,t3_uewirz,2022-04-29 23:44:07,TwoXChromosomes,"Your CEO is trying to dupe you. 

You are TAKING ON MORE WORK, so you need a raise. Period. 

""I have no way to track the finance portion"" --- In real life, if he can't track his finances, his company will go under real fast, or the finance team can skim in an instant. This statement is complete bullhonkey.

This is also where to start the conversation about your compensation for the NEW WORK you're doing. 

Before you start that conversation, review the job description as well as what your previous boss actually did but didn't make it to the official description. Examine all those responsibilities and set some SMART goals. Start with easy stuff, like getting bills paid on time and any responsibilities from your assistant job, since you're familiar with what ""success"" is for those tasks. Look for internal records about year-over-year financial performance as well. 

Then get into the more in-depth items. Give yourself more leeway on tasks that are a big stretch for you. At the end of this, you should have a list that looks something like this (sorry, not in finance, so this may be more accounting-like stuff):

* Pay all vendor invoices on time
* Work with HR to ensure payroll is funded and paid on time 
* Complete quarterly statements within xx days of month close
* Complete year-end statements within xx days of year-end close
* Reduce reporting time for zz reports by 5%
* Manage investment portfolio to achieve 3% growth over the year

Essentially, you're creating a list of what you're planning to do, with measurable goals, so that you BOTH can easily track if you're doing what you said you would. Set your goals low - better to overachieve than overpromise. This takes his main argument of ""I don't know if you're working"" away completely. 

Then compare this list and job title with jobs in your area and industry. Include remote jobs in your comparison. If you have contact with your former boss, ask what he was being paid. If you have access to salary information through your position, you may already know this or be able to look it up, saving you a conversation. Determine what a fair salary would be based on these comps and your internal information. Go with the highest reasonable salary. Then add at least 15%. Also set a lower bound for your new salary. Your lower bound should be significantly higher than your current salary.

Now you're armed for a negotiation with your CEO. I am not the best negotiator out there, so read up on negotiation tactics, especially salary negotiation tactics for women. You may also want to pop by [Ask A Manager](https://www.askamanager.org/), a column written by a female HR expert, that I'm 99% sure has covered a situation like this before.

 In the meeting, discuss your list/success plan. Focus on the NEW WORK and responsibilities you're picking up, the skills required, and the strategic thinking necessary. Highlight how you plan to manage the workload of your predecessor as well as any duties you're retaining from your assistant role. I'm going to assume the roles are merging. Remind the CEO of any specific training or certification that you may have specific to the role. Conclude by pitching your fair salary + 15%.

The CEO will absolutely run the salary down. The extra 15% sets the bar high, meaning that it's more likely to get you the salary you actually want.

Do not talk about your schedule. Whether you're picking your kid up from school, doing laundry, or doing experimental art, it's irrelevant. Do not talk about being a mom. It's irrelevant. Focus on the work you're doing, how efficient it will be, how seamless it will be, how you will improve business outcomes. This is all about the NEW WORK you're doing, and how you'll be compensated for that work.

If worse comes to worst, ask him if he wants to waste $40,000 (or whatever your old salary is) per year. You may be able to tell him he can't afford to waste $40k per year, depending on how the business is running. Because if you don't get the raise you're asking for, which would include Responsibilities X and Y, you will go back to your old position of just doing X. He will have to hire someone else to do Y. That will cost at least (the new salary) plus [recruiting costs of $4k](https://resources.workable.com/tutorial/faq-recruitment-budget-metrics). 

And while you're looking at those comps, see if there are any that you can apply to, or would be interesting in the future.

If your boss can prove that he has refused to give pay bumps to both men and women because he doesn't believe parents of any gender can have the necessary schedule for the raise, then you really don't have a claim.

From the looks of it, since you say you're the only female in the company, you may have a good claim for gender discrimination (assuming you document everything that's happened).

And I wouldn't accept the increased responsibility if he's not willing to give you a commensurate raise. I think you'd get similar advice if you posted over in /r/personalfinance.

Make sure to get your LinkedIn profile updated. Review other LinkedIn profiles for jobs like you have and jobs you'd like to have and use those as inspiration for your updates.

Also, there is a setting on linked in, ""open to work."" It is visible to recruiters, but not to people just browsing your profile.

Finally, if there are people you've worked with previously that you think might be willing to post a recommendation on your profile endorsing your skills or talking about why you're a good employee, hit them up and ask them if they mind doing so.

All of that can go a long way toward getting a recruiter's attention. The job market is crazy right now, it's a great time to be looking.

If they ask why you're looking so soon after starting your current position, no need to badmouth your current employer. Just say that the job ended up not being what was described and you're looking for a better fit.

This is a very common excuse for the new work from home management.  They are very poor at seeing productivity other than sales or hard numbers equivalent to results.  That being said, it sounds like he‚Äôs using it as an excuse.  My bet is he‚Äôs sees you are needing the job desperately so he can afford to cut his budget cost with your salary.  

I‚Äôd start by trying to get him to set some KPIs, ask how everyone being in the office would magically allow him to see you equally to give you a raise.  And document everything.  If there are other similar roles in other departments, inquire with HR what their pay is at.  

What state are you in?  In CA the employer had to give you your salary range when asked, ask to see where you are in the range and if you can open a dialog about what you value your work at.

All of this is very difficult in certain work environments, so document everything.  I think you should open a job search as well, a job offer is good leverage on managers like this, they think they have you stuck, so leave.

Any CEO that uses that as an excuse basically SCREAMS that he does not deserve his title. 

First off, this just sounds like plain favoritism/sexism. 
Secondly, as a CEO, he should have learned how to create a scalable grading rubric for your position, and the fact that he stated he can‚Äôt ‚Äútrack‚Äù something at his level  just showing that he doesn‚Äôt have the leadership skills to direct a team of managers, or he is willfully ignoring your position and what your responsibilities are. 

Not every org is the same, but in every one I‚Äôve managed, Managers have been treated as such, and are allowed to dictate their time however necessary as long as the job gets done at the end of the day. 

Sounds like this guy is just a micro managing ass hat. 

What I would personally do is break it down to numbers. 

Showcase what can be done at your peak performance. Show numbers for your business model to support it. 

If after that he still refuses, then get HR involved.

i6rdn9w,t3_uewirz,2022-04-30 05:41:33,TwoXChromosomes,"Wooooow. There are certainly red flags with the CEO which cannot be ignored. I scrolled a bit down and noticed you just started the role so you are a little hesitant to leave. I'm curious why being new to the role is a factor in leaving? To clarify, are filling in the role until a new finance manager is hired or did you fill the role permanently? I assume the latter but figured I'd confirm. Also, how long have you been in the finance manager role?

Assuming you are the permanent finance manager and you've been in the role for a few months, when you meet with the CEO to have another discussion about pay, I would prepare some evidence to show that you're fulfilling the duties in the same manner as the old manager and really highlight anything that may be going even better with you in the role. I'm not 100% sure what your duties are so I'm gonna take a stab at generic duties. I think good evidence would be things like AP payments go out on time, AR is received on time, books are closed on time, reports are sent on time, maybe you made some improvements to processes. Basically providing a picture of the ""ships still afloat so don't give me that BS about not being sure if things are getting done"" but in a nice way that also cannot be denied. If the CEO is still hesitant, maybe ask if there's anything that the other finance manager did they you may not have been aware of and ask for samples of the work so that you can review it. Basically make him tell you if you are missing something and make him show you proof of the work but play it as if you are willing to deliver the same level of work as the old manager and need the old work for reference.

Frankly, from the sounds of it, it does seem the best thing is to essentially prepare to leave from here on out. Being that your CEO is giving you this treatment, even if he gives you the raise, I think it's safe to assume you will run into similar resistance in the future again. You don't have to leave next month or anything, but start preparing now as you probably know already finding a job is A LOT of work and is almost a second job itself. Do things slowly so it can be done over a longer period of time and the work will be ready when you are comfortable leaving the company. Work on your resume. Review job postings so you know what pay range to come in at when speaking to your CEO and at future interviews. Do some networking where possible. Update your linkedin but make sure your updates aren't broadcasted to anyone at your company. Start profiles on other sites like Monster if that's still used, ZipRecruiter, Workopolis, etc. Talk to a few recruiters so they can look around on your behalf.

If you are new to the role, I do think the CEO has a small point (a miniscule point). I'm sure you're doing fine but maybe there's some tasks you haven't come across yet. Just trying to play devil's advocate to add some perspective. Maybe the CEO just needs to see that you can perform consistently over a slightly longer period of time before giving you a raise.

If the schedule doesn't allow for it but you have high quality work I would give a pay raise into a non-manager position. I don't know your skills or qualifications but if they are giving a title and not matching the salary, that's a no go and you shouldn't accept the position. Depending on the responsibilities of your job role, attendance can be flexible as long as the work gets done and you are contactable for emergencies but there are definitely many companies that really do need that attendance.

It's not fair but I seen an argument where you don't become a manager at all. At least for the places I have worked a manager does need to be present most of the time. You don't deserve more money just for having a kid or being a single parent if that affects company operations. That's a personal life choice and its often a choice between family or career. Sounds like you chose family. I don't think you should be penalized either of course but it would be weird for companies to reward people for having children and not being able to show up for the expected hours that everyone else works. That isn't their responsibility and it isn't fair to coworkers if someone is getting paid more while not fulfilling company requirements. I'd be pissed if someone only worked 5 hours a day while I am stuck working 8 hours. Then I find out they get paid more? You not showing up for work is the companies responsibility regardless of the reason. I don't really want to get into family planning. That touches a lot of nerves and is highly personal. Companies don't care and shouldn't be responsible for dealing with your personal life though. If the previous manager was not working 9-5's and they changed the rules that's a whole different story.

But to repeat what I said at the start, I'd decline the position. There are plenty of manager openings. Companies do this because they think you are replaceable. It takes way more than two weeks to have a replacement for you. Let them suffer and get hired back on for an even higher salary after a short vacation. Either decline and stay in your old role or give them the two week notice. If you feel you are qualified for the manager role then act like it. They would need you, not the other way around.

OP, I know nothing about your job or your own competence, but I 100% think you're above it. As others have touched on here about micromanaging being a symptom of incompetent leadership, the idea that they are more concerned about **seat hours** rather than **value added to the company** especially at what I believe to be a somewhat high position on the ladder as opposed to entry or mid level 'worker' work, is very telling.

I have a great anecdote. I'm a construction professional on $50 an hour and the whole team agrees we're getting screwed. Our technical supervisors, our direct bosses, are on nearly $60. My boss got sick of the pay and she went straight to head office and said ""I've just gotten an offer from another company [common in our industry] for **X** but I really like this job and want to stay on the project.""

It was 100% a bluff but they matched it instantly because they know we bring the value to the table. I wouldn't necessarily advocate a blatant bluff with no fall back plan, but it sounds like you need to do exactly that. It sounds like you need to tell the CEO straight to their face that if they're more concerned with how much time you spend in a chair tapping keyboard rather than the actual *value* you provide to the company then it just tells you that they don't trust you and that they need to just fire you. You should tell them straight to their face that at your high level of work they should be able to directly track the value you provide to the company **through your work** rather than by how much time you spend doing the work and that they're failing if they can't do that.

Then if they keep pressing on issues like laundry just tell them how it is. *People don't do laundry, washing machines do laundry, you spend 2 minutes putting washing and detergent in them, you come back an hour later to clean clothes and spend 1 minute transferring them from washer to dryer, then you come back in another 1 to 2 hours to grab the clean clothes.* If it were me, I'd agree with them, I would say ""say that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home, put the kettle on and load the washing machine whilst my coffee is being made, then I'm going to work for 1 to 2 hours until the washing machine beeps. Then I'll get up, have a quick stretch, put on another coffee and put the clothes in the dryer whilst it's boiling. I'll grab that coffee and then go do another 1 to 2 hours work. Once the dryer is done I'll have done my 8 hours of work so I'll start dinner and hang up clothes whilst the stove is on...  And I'll do that all of one day a week.""

And if for some reason you really want this job and this work from home half the day position, I would mention that someone is far more likely to work 4 hours in the office, come home after lunch with no traffic and then put in 6 hours on the computer (2 OT) than a person would be to work 8 hours in the office, come home during peak traffic, then get on the computer and do 2 hours of overtime, and having the stress of house chores on top. It's basic economics from all sides really, offices are great, but only when you're being there to achieve stuff, no merely for the sake of time card punching.",RogueThief7,t2_gvenr,2,0,reddit3

My wife was in a similar position years ago at a small MSP. The boss was talking about profit sharing instead of raises for everyone, doing X, providing Y, and ever time the company made a decent chunk of money he would just go spend it on some new product or tool or something to try and make more money -- not the worst idea, but he NEVER rewarded the employees doing the work. it was always give himself a pay bump or a bonus and try to find something else to sell people. he didnt give her raises he promised, and he didnt give what he promised to staff. 

so one day she got fed up with his bullshit in a team meeting, stood up and said she was tired of his profit sharing bullshit lies because she sees how he spends his money, and that she quit. 

he freaked out, had to retain her hourly as a contractor for a couple of months, and 6 months later all the other workers who realized she was right had also left. i think he was left with 1 or 2 people when he had a dozen prior to that. fuck that guy. he was a shit head. 

there have been some studies that show \*some\* of why women get paid less is because they take some flexibility at work to be mothers. maybe that makes a little sense **if** they cant actually keep up with all their work or as much work as other people. However, if you are doing ALL of your work, and then taking on MORE work, it make zero fucking sense not to compensate you. sounds like you are doing your job, so fuck this guy. 

is the work done? thats all you need to know. its done. its not ""are you working 8 hours a day"" because i promise some sales monkey sitting at home isnt. IS THE WORK DONE. thats all. the work is done? you get paid. you do more work? you deserve more money. you do work consistently? you deserve at least a CoL raise. You do work very well? you deserve a merit raise. doesnt matter if you bounce out to pick up the kids, or start laundry. If the work is done you should get paid.

And yes I do this even more intensely with promotions but I won't hold back their increase for more than 2 months. 2) I handle a decent amount of the finance myself but the rest of it is done by a consultant and I sometimes don't even speak to them for 3 months... why is it so important that you are in an office? Explore that question perhaps even with your boss... is he afraid you could make mistakes and cost the company, is he afraid of payroll issues, is there an excessive amount of personal daily interaction regarding financial issues that could be frustrating and difficult to handle remotely? 3) Do you otherwise really enjoy the company and people, is it worth hanging in there and negotiating terms that you are happy with? Could you see yourself there long term?

It is not fair that he is not understanding your concerns regarding your child, especially as you have already agreed to the compromise of getting child care if he puts you in a position that it's affordable.

He says he can ‚Äútrust‚Äù sales people that work from home via sales metrics, you should then present him the relevant metrics for a finance role at your company. Show historical data as well and indicate thresholds for those metrics. This of course assumes you‚Äôre doing you‚Äôre job well. Tell him you‚Äôll commit to continuing this reporting in exchange for your raise. I have no idea what the company is but it sounds small so imagine you‚Äôre doing things like creating P&Ls, maintaining accounts receivable and payable, filing and paying relevant taxes. Come up with reporting around timeliness of creating P&Ls, tax filings and payables. Creating agings on receivables and show how efforts to get clients to pay come from you. Show him the value you bring. 

It‚Äôs worth noting he‚Äôs not against the idea of working from home, just the associated accountability. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs correct. It could still be because he doesn‚Äôt believe women deserve to be paid equally, but that‚Äôs where his mind is at. So attack that point first (professionally).",moldyhands,t2_i2q4j,52,0,reddit3

i6rkhm1,t1_i6qohnn,2022-04-30 07:14:00,TwoXChromosomes,"Micromanaging is an example of a bad CEO, leader, manager, business owner.

A good leader doesn't need to peer over shoulders to inspect the outcome of anyone's work. Hell, the fact he said he can't ensure she gets work done in finance goes to show he knows little about business.

Finance generates data and information that executives use. The facilitate the pricing, orders, systems that keep the business running. Any manager who wants to know if work gets done only needs to inspect the outcome, and occasionally the progress if we're talking long projects. The progress inspection is only for course correction. Results are what matter. It doesn't matter if someone is doing while working from home as long as the results are delivered. Leave flexibility for employees to balance work life, inspire them with a vision and goal, and let them do their magic to move the company forward. Finance is back office and wasting time trying to micromanage back office is a sign that someone is more afraid of how the finance situation appears than what the company actually needs to deliver. I don't run a business anymore but this crap is business basics.

i6r36eb,t1_i6px233,2022-04-30 03:46:54,TwoXChromosomes,"please don't listen to the prior comment. There's a lot of people on this subreddit that are just poorly informed about the law, and spew out advice that's quite frankly harmful to follow. 

being a parent is *not* a protected class. being a woman is, but since you already acknowledge having a schedule accommodation vs the male employees, it makes it harder to claim you are being discriminated against based solely on your gender. 

further, if they only have one female employee, I am guessing this is a very small company (<40 employees). You are unlikely to find a halfway decent lawyer that would take this case on contingency given the small potential settlement. 

so that means paying out of pocket for a lawyer. and you will definitely find one, even though it wont be worthwhile -- you know how people around here say ""HR isn't your friend"" (like a broken record), well guess what, lawyers aren't either! lawyers want to maximize their billing, and some will encourage you to pursue or drag out cases to your detriment (talk to anyone who has gone through a divorce where there's significant assets involved). 

my advice to you is to start looking for a job elsewhere. the hiring market is tight now so you should be able to find a role somewhere else quickly. and importantly you should leave on good terms with your current boss (for gods sake dont secretly record them). it sounds like you have a back office job while the other managers are more client facing (which is why your manager has better metrics to track their output); back office roles are far more dependent on employer references since you don't have a book of business or hard performance figures to back you up.

Many companies nowadays are far more open after the pandemic to just how much is neccessary to balance work and life. People have been resigning in droves from companies that can't figure it out. 

My point about consulting isn't to quit and have them beg for her, she will already have a job.

If you left fast enough, you can basically leave it off your resume and have no ""gaps"" between rounded months at the prior and next employer.

But if it's Financial Assistant -> Finance Manager (actual titles?) or some other decent career bump, then you could make the decision its worth it in the short term. Even going back and pitching the title change as most important, and that you'll revisit pay later...maybe pitching even a better title that you were going to get (like Financial Controller?) so he can feel like he ""won"" by giving you something free.

Sounds like a child's temper tantrum but it was a 40+ adult man, and this behavior was common and accepted by their peers. 

I was also treated badly by the other older women there. You get so much unsolicited attention as a young woman, some women felt it took it away from them and clearly resented me. This was especially true of the women that worked on the side as prostitutes, which is typically common. 

Drug use was very prevelant despite obvious 0 tolerance. Many of the young women were extremely vulnerable and ended up hooking up with men that could be their grandpa to get a fix. 

I would never recommend it to a young woman, especially not if they're going alone.


Edit to add the mental side effects. It was extremely isolating and depressing. I felt like I was being erased, and I would at some point no longer exist. I used to have nightmares that would wake me in the middle of the night of going back.",fuchstress,t2_5a9sd28c,95,0,reddit4

kk8amrm,t3_1aeeld8,2024-01-30 07:38:04,TwoXChromosomes,"I know this page is meant for women, but I am a dude and I have worked on oil rigs. My Dad spent an entire 45 year career working on oil rigs, my older brothers (2 of them) spent 20 and 3 years working on oil rigs. I do know about this industry and can give you the pros and cons of it. 

Pros:

* The pay is very good (I made $20/hour entry level back in 2006, I think starting is currently around $36-40/hour entry level, but not sure about your particular market rates). Let me put it this way, I worked for 8 weeks one summer and paid for 1.5 years of college before I had to go back to work. 
* There's no need for formal education or even any kind of accreditation or trade school to get started. I started the summer after my first year of University, my oldest brother started 3 days after his 18th birthday with absolutely no prior work experience. The only training I had was what the company provided plus WHIMIS and Fall Arrest (which the company paid for)
* If she has no issues working hard and earns the respect of her crew members, they'll go to the ends of the earth to protect her (same would be true if she were a boy). If she doesn't, they won't have a lot of time for her. 

Cons:

* The schedule kind of sucks (typically 12 hour shifts working 2 weeks on and 1 week off)
* The people I worked with were generally great and I have heard about a lot of very good people my Dad, brothers, cousins, etc worked with. I have also heard a lot of stories about people working with coke heads, meth heads, raging alcoholics, and people with clearly unchecked mental health issues - good paying job tends to attract people who will go do one two week stretch, collect a couple thousand dollars, and never be heard from again. Even more pertinent, I have also heard stories of men trying to sexually assault the women that do come to the rig camp (typically camp cooks, medics, camp cleaning crew, etc).
* It is hard physical labour and will take a toll on your body. When you're young, you don't notice it too much, but as you age, it gets worse
* It can be incredibly dangerous. The reason my one brother only worked 3 years is because he had an accident on the rig, got pinned between a massive hydraulic piece of equipment and a metal pipe. Had he been a few inches shorter, he would be dead right now because the hydraulic equipment would have crushed his throat . Even being the height he is, he still has an injured arm and recurring back issues some 20 years later. 
* There will be a lot of travel involved typically and she will have to spend a lot of time away from home. Make sure she has a 4x4 vehicle that can handle shitty gravel roads because she'll be driving on them at some point. 
* The industry is notoriously fickle. If this is a short-term job your daughter is looking (ie. work a couple years to save up for University or something) then that's probably fine. If she's looking at a long-term thing, make sure she's ready to be financially responsible. If you'd have given me a dollar for every 18 year old boy that went to work on rigs and found themselves dead broke and unemployed by 25 because oil prices dropped below $50/barrel, then I wouldn't have had to go work on rigs. The most common pitfalls you'll see for these boys are: addictions (gambling, drinking, drugs), impulse buying (new truck every couple years, house before they're ready, fancy toys, etc), and generally not budgeting to save a nest egg before the next oil downturn happens. 

Conclusion:

I'm not going to tell your daughter or you how to live her life. If she thinks she is physically tough enough for the work, then I say have at it. But she should go into it with her eyes open. She's most likely going to see a lot of drug users and drinkers. The work is going to be hard, there's no two ways about it, it's hard work. There's a lot of moving parts to an oil rig, so she will always have to be careful and make sure she stays safe. But she'll also make some damn good money. I don't have kids myself, but I do have a 17 year-old niece. If it were me and she were my kid, I would be reluctant to send her to work on an oil rig. But at the end of the day, it would be her choice.",mydreamturnip,t2_any3v,11,0,reddit4

Not all the men on the rigs are pigs, but the term rig pig exists for a reason. The camp I was at had one woman and holy shit was it uncomfortable hearing the men talk about her. The majority of men out there have 0 respect for their own wives, let alone a random coworker. 

&#x200B;

100% a woman could do the work and endure the bullshit ""culture"" if you can even call it that, but most of the men will just view her as an object, think she gets preferential treatment for being a woman, talk openly about the things they would do to her and depending on the site and the people there, possibly not even try to protect her from the men in the camp. It is the only field I wouldn't recommend to anybody and it has nothing to do with the work itself. It's 100% the men who stay in the field and their complete lack of respect for women. Most of them don't even talk about women like they're human beings.

&#x200B;

I was a plumber for years and the trades have their own hurdles for women (typically the men they work with more than anything), but I think any woman interested in blue collar work should go for it and help diversify the field. I just can't in good conscience recommend anyone, but especially a woman, work on an oil rig given my personal experience. I honestly don't think it would be a safe environment. I would literally rather play with other people's shit for the rest of my life than spend another week on an oil rig.

&#x200B;

I should also add that the rig I worked on was one of the best performing rigs, had the best safety regulations and overall actually followed process and HR guidelines and it was **still** fucking terrible.

Oil rigs and mines have gotten a lot safer and stricter when it comes to sexual harrassment policies over recent years. A couple technicians I worked with have worked with a few women in the oil sands, so while still very male dominated your daughter likely won't be the only woman on site. I also suggest your daughter finds a specific trade to pursue, something that will be a longer term career that can transfer outside of oil rigs.

Have a thick skin, never let them see you cry. Be able to take jokes, many men are harmless, just rough around the edges so having a sense of humor makes it much easier. As a woman in a male dominated field you will have to work twice as hard and expect to receive half the recognition for said work. Stand up for yourself and don't take any shit from men. Give them an inch they will take a mile. Don't shit where you eat. Join the gym and start building your strength, make sure to eat lots of protein. If you aren't sure, ask questions. New hires are the most likely to get hurt on the job, safety first!  It is not an easy path but if you love what you do it is worth it.

I was a wireliner from when I graduated college in 2019 up until I quit in 2021. I experienced sexual harassment to the point where I feared for my life. When I stood up for myself against a certain creepy operator, he began sabotaging my jobs. I had to double check everything he did, because he started unlatching harnesses and pulling safety pins in the middle of my jobs. In front of 5 other coworkers, he told me that he wanted to watch me dance naked on top of a pool table. He was in his 50s and had a daughter my age. I asked him how he would feel if someone treated his daughter that way... his response was ""if my daughter said she wanted to go into the oilfield, I would tell her she was fucking crazy!"" All I could think (and I regret not saying it) was ""yeah, because of men like YOU."" The reason I quit was because of safety concerns. I was the crew leader, and was responsible for leading the job safely, but I was so sleep deprived that I was hallucinating. I was working anywhere from 80 to 135 hours PER WEEK. In early 2021 I was driving home for time off and fell asleep at the wheel. Thankfully I just drifted off into a grassy median and nobody got hurt, but it was a wake up call for me (no pun intended) that if I stayed in that job, I was going to be responsible for someone's injury or death. Perhaps my own. I took the first job I could get and got out of there. Now I'm a project manager planning these types of oilfield operations, and I put a heavy emphasis on safety. If you're too tired, you're not welcome on my job site. Family emergency? Not welcome on my job site. You're not in trouble, just go handle your business and come back when you're in the right physical and mental condition to work safely. 

Your daughter can certainly work wherever she wants, but it will be a challenge. I would recommend that she set some ""dealbreaker"" criteria for herself before she starts (ex: I will NOT work >80 hrs/wk. I WILL quit if I feel that I am in danger. Etc) and write those down so she can reference them later. Once you're in the field, it's easy to keep justifying things and saying ""I guess it's not SO bad""  so I wish I had some of those statements to anchor me.

Both started as Roustabout, one became a Pit Watcher (and later moved to an service company that specialized in on-site drilling fluid analysis).  Both could be physically demanding jobs, and expectations varied amongst the men; there were the men who expected women have equal performance to themselves, despite the girls being physically weaker, and others who were happy to help out (some a little more happy than others).  Luckily, many of the policies for the more bone-headed strength tests idjits have changed procedures to be less strenuous... that said, lifting a 50+ pound chemical sack or wiekding a 60"" pipe wrench are still required for a lot of work, or understanding how to repair pumps and motors and winches.

The pay is so good because yes it is physically demanding but it is also mentally taxing.

Have you ever stepped from light to a world of pure darkness where the world falls away beneath your feet?  If the ocean is calm the rest of the world is in dead silence the only sound comes from machine you are standing on. A rig is unlike anything else at night it's a small island of light amongst the void.  It's a different world.  Storms can be frightening yes but the isolation of a calm night is unnerving.  I never felt more alone then I did on a rig on a calm moonless night.

Injuries? not that concerning there's a medic on hand for day to day stuff if anything serious happens like any other job you're taken off site via ambulance in this case it's a helicopter.  I don't know where the rig would be located so can't go further like times.

People make the mistake of thinking it's all about brute force, which isn't true, as you're going to be using tools and machines to do the job. In my experience stamina is the more important than brute force so as long as she can hoist the tools she can do the work. Doing it for the entire shift is what matters in day to day operations. The thing no one ever thinks to do is build your stamina with cardio before hand because well you're doing this all day not just for short bursts so how long you can last is important.

I suggest she take something like a baseball bat and see how long she can hold it out at arms length as a baseline and work on that. Oh and for the love of god spend the money and buy really good and comfortable work boots!!!!! as your world is mostly steel your spine will thank you. They'll tell you the requirements, I'm not up to date on those, but in any labour job good boots will always be important.

You'll be exhausted the first round no matter what that's the life.

If you're concerned about work safety, so long as her risk management team is doing their job she should be fine.

If you're worried about her doing the work, then that's all going to depend on her commitment and which job she's looking at. Being a deckhand or roughneck can be grueling. Coming in with some trade knowledge (electrical. Instrumentation, etc.) will be less physically backbreaking.

If you're worried about personal safety, then while nothing is guaranteed,  any good company will have done an analysis beforehand to limit that and will come down strongly at the first hint of trouble.

If you're worried about emotional safety then that is more of a crapshoot. Though progress has been made, many rigs and platforms are insular communities and resistant to change. She'll still have to deal with misogyny and insinuations that she's less capable. Most of the worst of it won't be said to her, but she'll still hear about.

Terrible shame she can't safely pursue this work like a guy can without question, but the pay is 'good' to make up for increased risk of injury, no social life at all, and also the mental toll it takes being out on the ocean for 3-6 months at a time. High alcoholism and drug dependency rates within the working demographic of oil rig workers is also present.

Funnily enough extracting ever depleting fossil fuels in a remote area faster than your competitors for comparatively not great pay for how much of your life you give up to make a very small cabal of rich people even richer turns out to be depressing. Who knew?

I know other people are saying if she has her heart set on it let it be, but I'd try and put her onto something else, like an apprenticeship on land in a trade where she can still be supported by you if need be. Carpentry and plumbing pay stupid money after some formative work/learning years.

koa5gu4,t1_kkb1o5m,2024-01-31 14:03:48,TwoXChromosomes,"That should be less of a danger to a mouthy western woman then lol, not likely the ideal target if you‚Äôre relying on social pressure to keep your victims silent - and we know enforcement takes it seriously (to the point of designating women-only carriages).¬†

But yes - Japan still has issues - you‚Äôll find¬†almost every country does disservice to their female citizens (the US itself is highly problematic)¬†-¬†but consider the impact of being groped on a train to a sexual assault in your workplace.¬†

The environment / dynamics are key.

There‚Äôs not as much preventing you from reporting a stranger, this is not someone you‚Äôll need to see everyday, or someone who has value to a superior of yours, with power over you directly or indirectly. There‚Äôs limited opportunity for these train strangers to access you, and limited social constraints preventing you from reacting appropriately (esp as a foreigner lol), and likely a recording will be available of the incident.¬†

Now imagine being locked in isolation with a group of men over months on an oil rig, rather than minutes on a train - imagine the dynamics that emerge in that domineering environment - when you have superiors more concerned with keeping the peace than justice - and likely from top to bottom - ‚Äúmen‚Äôs men‚Äù who deeply harbour a disregard for women.¬†

This is why I‚Äôd encourage her to go somewhere on free land - v. an oil rig or the military - the long term confinement is the biggest risk factor, not just through the privacy that enables assault, but also the dynamics those men develop in isolation.¬†

I‚Äôd always encourage her to go with a buddy if possible - women are safest in numbers (there‚Äôs a reason we don‚Äôt go out alone at night even here in the west) - it would reduce her risks on the oil rig or the train.¬†

But under entirely her own power, she‚Äôll be safer contending with Japanese trains than American oil rigs.¬†¬†

As I mentioned in my original comment, there will be difficulties regardless, especially as a woman alone - but confronting those difficulties is how we grow as people.¬†¬† 

It‚Äôs why our youths are drawn to wander I expect, to fill themselves with challenging new experiences and knowledge of self, and if you‚Äôre looking to set yourself up financially while you‚Äôre at it - I think teaching in Japan or working the oil sands of Alberta would be a safer prospect for a woman than an oil rig or the military.¬† 

Mad respect for the women who push ahead unsafely anyway - confronting these difficulties en masse is the only way we expand our scope as a gender as well - but I would strongly recommend the caution of having a group of women around you while taking on such a task.¬†¬†

It‚Äôs still no guarantee of safety, but anything that might offer you protection from the potential trauma, or support in the aftermath, will be worth it‚Äôs weigh in gold out there.",greatfullness,t2_155imw,1,0,reddit4
koa1b3a,t1_ko7w740,2024-01-31 13:33:47,TwoXChromosomes,"For sure, I‚Äôve heard what a brutal grind it can be - and how racist / sexist Asian cultures are generally.

As a foreign traveller though - we‚Äôre just concerned about the incidents of harassment and assault you might experience at work or while out and about - gender violence v gender equality.

In that regard, I hear it‚Äôs very safe - low incidents of crime and comfortable to walk the streets alone at night etc. We‚Äôre not talking the background gender operations of the culture - we‚Äôre talking individual safety from assault and harassment - and Japan is absolutely not on the same level as Pakistan in that respect.

Their society is much higher functioning - problematic though it may still be - and incapable though they may still be of reporting / prosecuting incidents efficiently (along with most developed nations).

It‚Äôs still a very polite and reserved culture, where you don‚Äôt expect break downs in decorum that would result in such assaults - compared to a place like Pakistan where such assaults are part of the decorum.¬†

That‚Äôs quite a difference.

In my experience, the western teachers mostly interact with and date each other - the cultural/sexist divide can be a lot to overcome - but you‚Äôve still got a whole country to explore, low costs, and a fat paycheque to enjoy.¬†

As a young woman, you also won‚Äôt be in a dangerously controlled and confined situation like you would be on an oil rig.¬†A lot of these things happen behind closed doors - a safe home base and less oppressive environment will leave mostly public incidents to contend with - and that‚Äôs not something the Japanese are known for.

Unlike Pakistan with it‚Äôs public gang rapes and beheadings:

https://thediplomat.com/2021/08/how-pakistan-failed-its-women/

Global Gender Gap 2021¬†index; it placed¬†151st out of 153¬†in 2020. In a Reuters Foundation poll in 2018, Pakistan was ranked as the sixth-most dangerous country for women.

Japan is 120th on that Gender Gap index - again not great, and I‚Äôve read plenty of reports of women ground down at home (now expected to work the long hours of the salaryman while also carrying 100% of childcare / household labour) as well as in the workplace (representing less than 10% of management) - but that‚Äôs not a big safety concern for an 18 year old adventurer.

She‚Äôd be more concerned with indexes like the one below - where Pakistan is listed as the 6th most dangerous to women, and Japan didn‚Äôt place:

https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1JM01Z/

It‚Äôs apples and oranges trying to compare Pakistan to Japan in terms of violence against women, keeping in mind of course, you‚Äôll be hard pressed to find any country without problematic treatment of women.

Fun fact, the US (who operate these oil rigs women have come to consider so dangerous) did make the list:

10. UNITED STATES - The only Western nation in the top 10 and joint third with Syria for the risks women face in terms of sexual violence, including rape, sexual harassment, coercion into sex and a lack of access to justice in rape cases.",greatfullness,t2_155imw,1,0,reddit4

In the first video, what those guys are doing is called ""spinning chain"". It's not a super common practice anymore, but you will still see it sometimes. If you look closely around 0:16, the guy in black shirt gets pulled with the chain towards the pipe while holding the chain. He got close, but got out in time. Had he not, he would quite likely have lost a finger (or broken one at the bare minimum). There are a lot of old timers in the oil industry missing digits because of that exact process. Next look at 0:52 when the guy in the grey shirt whips the chain up the pipe. Had his partner not stepped back in time, he would have caught that chain upside the face. There are plenty of stories of jaws being broken that way. 

In the second, those two guys are ""making a connection"" or simply connecting one pipe to the next so that they can drill deeper into the ground. If your daughter takes the job, this is what she will likely be doing Day 1 and she'll likely do it 1-5 times per hour every hour for 12 hours a day. That is entry level work on the oil rig. See that thing with three handles those guys throw around? That's called a pair of slips. Depending on the size of pipe they're using, it can weigh between 80 and 200 lbs. Watch from about 0:36 - 0:40 and see how fast those handles are spinning. If you're not careful and catch one of those in the leg, it can break your ankle or leg. Those big claw-like things the guys are throwing around are called tongs. At about 1:32, check out how the guy in the long-sleeved shirt braces the tong with his right arm. If he doesn't get in position before the driller pulls on that chain to spin the tong, it just yanks the tong hard. Could catch him in the leg, the stomach, head, chest, wherever. One driller not paying attention and that guy could have a serious injury.",mydreamturnip,t2_any3v,64,0,reddit4

f6li1wt,t3_drv5cg,2019-11-05 09:29:21,TwoXChromosomes,"I almost never post, but felt like I should offer my opinion when I saw this post. 

I understand how not in control and basically helpless you feel when you have been racially fetishized. I grew up experiencing this on a monthly basis and I felt so, so helpless. People like Steve get away with stuff like that b/c people dont do anything about it. Asians want peace and not to play the game.

Then, I married a  street smart lawyer and learned what I SHOULD have done to turn the tables. It's a game, so you gotta play it, too. 

What I do when this type of stuff happens is I make sure to take the power back such that people like Steve don't have the power. You can choose what to do, but If I were you I would have done the following:

--cut Steve off at the very beggining. Steve got upset b/c you let him mess with you, then wanted him to stop doing that. But, if it was cut off at the onset, he probably wouldn't have been as upset. He got a taste of his pervy power and got upset you started asserting yourself after he got a taste. 

1) When people ask me my Asian nationality, I almost never tell them. I just smile and not say anything or say oh, oh you have ALOT of questions?! and change the subject.  Usually, Pervy Men ask for your nationality so they can be lazy and judge you on the nationality that you are or your ethnicity. It's not rude to not tell them. If they had good intentions they will usually get the point and get to know you more, after which later you can tell them if the subject comes up. You don't owe anybody any information like that and it's not rude to not tell them. They won't like you any less if they are well intentioned. Asians are raised to be polite and in America it's often misconstrued as allowing people to overstep bounds and that's NOT OK.

2.) When Steve told you about the girls in said country he's fucked, I would have said, "" I just wanted to be clear about your order and your order is...??!!"" and act very stern, professional, and no-non sense. If I really wanted to be assertive I would have said, "" Sir, this is a coffee shop and I'm here to give you your order. May I ask you what your order is??? ""Sir, if you are currently unable to give me your order I will be helping the person behind you"" Steve poked you to see how far he could get, and when you let him, he charged on ahead. 

Then, that same day, you tell your manager and report that you have been sexually harassed. Exaggerate it a tad if you have to. Most people don't care about direct, outward racism towards Asians, as much as about other minorities. ALWAYS report in alignment with what other people actually CARE about. This is why I would emphasize verbal SEXUAL harassment. IT WAS SEXUAL HARRASSMENT. BY doing nothing, your employer promoted a sexual harrassment charged workplace. 
3.) If you get written up, file a complaint with the LABOR BOARD of your state, that your employer threatened to FIRE YOU SO YOU QUIT, threatened to fire you and also wrote you up for defending yourself against worksite sexual harassment (the fucking other girls in said country). Most people dont care about racism towards Asians in America, or racial fetishes, so I would make it about a complaint emphasizing your manager tolerating sexual harassment from customers. The manager needs to know it's NOT OK to punish your employees for defending themselves on sexual harassment and allowing a sexual harassment charged workplace. Don't be afraid of retaliation. There are other ways to get references. 

4) I would in-person tell the coffee shop that he allowed a sexual harrassment charged workplace situation to continue and that this won't be the first time he loses a female employee if he keeps letting crazies into his cafe. I would also tell him that I will be reporting him to the labor Board and they will be doing an investigation. You could also write him a letter. I honestly would exaggerate the parts that can't be proven to the labor board. It's not your fault they dont care about racial fetishes so you gotta play smarter than them!

5) As a minority, I try to always work for a corporation or for myself. If this was Starbucks, they would have a procedure to handle it. Family-owned places always look great on Gilmore Girls, but it's not reality. 

https://m.wikihow.com/File-a-Complaint-Against-Your-Employer-(USA) 

MY STORY: ( and how I dealt with it....)

I will say that it is in Asian culture to not make waves in fear that things will be ""more fucked up"" but the truth is that if something is going to go to shit, it's gonna go to shit regardless of whether you speak up or not. In my shitty high school years ago, I took an honors class taught by a lazy trophy wife. I broke some bones and missed two weeks of class and the teacher filed a complaint to kick me out of the class to reduce her workload as she hated teaching. other kids were out 3+ weeks with other more severe illnesses and she didn't dare to kick them out b/c she knew that they were black/ white, and would be more vocal. She though that I wouldn't speak up. 

That  cost me a college partial scholarship. Later, in college, I had a teacher that HATED Asians. This teacher was half-asian herself and self-hating. She tried to fail me and several other asians on subjective grounds. I paid a super lazy and super old male psychologist $200 and lied that I had severe anxiety ( I researched it online before hand). I then took that anxiety diagnosis to the school's disability board and got  ""disabled student form"" which allowed me to take the test in a quiet location away from other students. I showed up at the racist half-asian teacher's office and said, ""professor I need to explain something that you need to know as my professor"" and showed up the disability letter. She asked why I didn't show it to her before and I said I was ""embarrassed."" we both knew it was a game. 

I guess the morale of my story is to ALWAYS SPEAK UP. People like Steve push boundaries b/c they are selfish assholes. If somebody speaks up, they usually move onto easier targets. 

From then on she graded me fairly as she didn't want to get into trouble for discriminating against a ""disabled student"" Mind you, the form I showed her didn't say what ""disability"" it was. Sometimes when people try to assert their power and society doesn't care, you need to be creative. You need to push a cause that they DO care about, like ""disabilities"" or ""sexual harrassment."" I doubt the white administrator would have given a flying hoot that this Asian professor was discriminating against Asian students.

The NYC taxis try sometimes to fuck me over/ rip me off. They never try to fuck over my White, male employees. I learned getting into NYC taxis to always start with a joke. ""Peter, Good Afternoon."" You know, you look like a nice guy! I just got out of a taxi that tried to scam me but I argued real loud and it got solved. Can you believe it? Anyways, How r you today, SIR?"" Right away, you warn them that you are not to be fucked with, while still being polite. Again, if they are well intentioned, saying that it not gonna make anything wierd. 

If Steve was doing that to me on a plane or the street, I would have cussed him out and shocked up. LOL!

Good luck and always speak up!!!!! Steve hates his own life and takes it out on others. Remember that.",Alaskan91,t2_140aq9,86,0,reddit1

I've been in the US several times for different conferences and workshops and as soon as people hear I'm Swedish I get several (often middle aged) men very interested in me. When I went to London with my partner I met an American man in the hotel lobby who felt it necessary to tell me I had ""all that Swedish sweetness he'd heard so much about"" about me and was so ""distracted by me"" that he couldn't focus on what he was doing. I've also had strangers (men) asking me how many people I've slept with, if I'm a virgin etc. Several people I've told have brushed it off as ""he's just flirting with you"" etc. At all these events I've wanted to leave but made myself stay because I refuse to be pushed away from opportunities because of sexual harassment directed at me.",CaptanaBanana,t2_111zvzr,10,0,reddit1

I (35/f) work in the service industry, as a chef, and chose to get a serving job at a new restaurant in my downtown to experience the front of the house... 
This is where I met Kent.  He lived in the penthouse in the condos above the restaurant, acted like he owned the place.  He was there daily. He would tip you $1-100 for how much attention you gave him that day. There were days that conversation was okay, but more often than not, it was inappropriate and creepy.    One night after my shift, I stuck around for drink with my bf (who had just lost his job).   Kent joined our table.  Chatted for a short time. He leans over in my ear and tells me I'd be better off on the corner and how much more money I'd be making to support my bf.  I stood up and smacked him across the face.   Of course, had to go talk to my manager as it caused a scene at my place of employment.  Not what I intended, I just had enough of his shitty comments.  I didn't lose my job; they had so many complaints, from staff and customers, they asked Kent not to come back.  Unfortunately, the restaurant closed a week or 2 later.

So hey OP, you may have encountered a sociopath in the wild.

Listen. One great trick I learnt doing years in hospo is that you need to realise people like him have shit, sad lives. One day a customer got angry for a 1 minute delay, accurate to the second here, not a euphemism. 1 min, and he threw a tantrum, threw his cash on the counter... It was 9am.

Just pity them.

But yeah, Steve needs more than pity... He needs some serious life lessons. Sadly this would be management's job.

Goah, what a shame.

I have a lot of female staff on checkouts and I will do anything for any member of staff if it means they can work their jobs safely and effectively.

We have a few 'steves' that come in, we know who they are and which tills they go to, ill swap the colleagues out and move them around so they don't have to interact with that person.

If I ever see a customer doing anything wrong or having a go at a member of staff, I will take that customer aside straight away. There's no way I'll let that continue as I'm the one trained to deal with bad customers, not the member of staff. If it means losing a customer to keep my staff happy and safe, I'll do it.

It takes just a few instances of invalid application of an equality measure for others to seize on it as representative of the whole population. OP had a legitimate reason to address the professor as discriminatory without a false diagnosis. The extremes of malingering have resulted in a social security system that sets such a high bar for defining a disability for eligibility that many who truly are unable to work cannot prove how disabled they are and cannot access minimal resources,or are relegated to a two or three year wait for an appeal hearing. It took people in wheelchairs throwing themselves out onto streets and sidewalks to get the ADA passed in 1993, which mandates legal accommodations MINIMALLY.

Ignoring all else, if it is midway into the semester, an application for disability related accommodations did not have to be honored. That needs to be submitted prior to or immediately after the start of classes, for reasons such as this situation here",guy_in_the_meeting,t2_3m8gu2wz,5,0,reddit1

And Loli is in short what the over-sexualized underage anime girls are refered to, wheras ""Lolita"" is directed towards the Novel in a much clearer sense. ""Lolita"" is also the name Humbert Humbert gives Dolores in the novel, to rob her more or less of her actual identity so he can well, fetishize her more easily and act like she really is as the fantasy he has of her better.

I did have to look that up with Epstein just now, but had you refered to it in its actual name it probably wouldnt have caused that confusion.

Because Anime is pretty diverse in its genres, so you can just avoid the genres that tend to involve that. But yes, I think, in harem and ecchi genres its pretty prevalent, then theres even anime that are entirely aimed at showing lolicon/shotacon, those are easiest to avoid cuz it becomes obvious with one look at the general description of said anime.
Theres genres like psychological horror, or shoujo anime and often action anime that tend to stay pretty far away from anything lolicon and shotacon.
But to be fair my interest in anime, since I have started to properly unravel my childhood trauma has become way less.  (The more I realized how much my father had groomed me, and the more I realized I only even have this interest in Anime cuz of him, the more I sort of started to get disgusted with Anime in general EVEN if a lot of genres sincerely do not involve shotacon/lolicon, so its not as easy to say that all anime has this issue, its certain genres that have that issue though for sure.)

Silicone is an incredibly broad term, there are many different types of silicone polymers and blends that can and do have a medical designation.

While it is very possible that the product you received is of low quality and Tulip is very clearly just a churn and burn volume resaler. It is also possible there is nothing wrong with the product material.

e50z963,t3_9ay12r,2018-08-29 10:01:07,TwoXChromosomes,"To the OP we are sorry you had a rash when using the cup, it is important if you do have any symptoms like this, as with any product, you must stop using the product straight away.

With regards to contacting us, you may have the wrong information, if you ordered from us a year ago. We have recently changed our customer service systems, so you may have to open a new support ticket online. If you could please do that so we can look into this for you.

We have to say, It was incredibly irresponsible of your gynaecologist to make a flippant comment about your rash being caused by our cup and inferring that it has latex in it.

There is simply no way to have made this conclusion unless they had directly had the product tested ( which they haven‚Äôt) and then given you tests to ensure it was the cup that caused the rash.

Had they had the cup tested, they would see the product only contains biocompatible silicone.

This scaremongering is not only unjust, It‚Äôs unfair to the thousands of customers who may see this post and be unduly concerned also.

Our products are not made from food grade silicone. As you can see from our terms and conditions page the full information is provided, as are the FDA links and test reports.

We have never hidden the fact that we make our products in China, we are proud to, they are a highly skilled workforce and produce something like 80% of the world's products. We also highlight in our terms and conditions that we may send your products directly from our factory in China. It‚Äôs much more eco-friendly to do so, to certain countries, as we ship worldwide.

The Tulip Cup is trying to change the way the world views periods and offer a more environmentally friendly option.

Informing the world there is an alternative option and changing belief systems is extremely costly, the hundreds of thousands of pounds, we spend each year on various forms of marketing, charity donations, school information packs is where the majority of the margin goes, then we have operational costs, packaging, systems, subscriptions, staff wages, government taxes, compulsory staff pensions etc

The small profit maintained is what allows us to maintain a viable business. 

Our buy get one free offer is really geared to fast forward our period change campaign, we hope that you share your free products with your friends and family and that they, in turn, offer their positive experience on to theirs.

This has been a very positive campaign and most of our sales come from referrals from users of our cup.

We hope that you continue to support positive changes in menstrual care and help us save up-to 11,000 disposable menstrual products hitting landfill in each ladies Menstrual lifetime.

With 5 billion women on the planet who are of childbearing age, we still have a way to go...

I‚Äôd always go for something relatively well-known and made in a country with some health/safety standards, e.g. something from the EU.

Stuff I‚Äôve used:

Femmecup, British(?) https://www.femmecup.com
Lunette small, Finnish https://www.lunette.com
Yuukil large, Czech https://www.yuukicup.com/en
Skooncup, USA https://www.sckoon.com

The lunette was my favourite for the size/shape/capacity/stem, and they come in colours so they look less nasty than the clear ones when they get discoloured. Other well known stuff: 

Mooncup, British, also sold in Boots https://www.mooncup.co.uk and https://www.boots.com/mooncup-size-b-10055280 and sold in the USA as MCUK https://www.mcuk.com

The Diva Cup gets sold in wholefoods in the US, but it‚Äôs a bit longer than other cups, many women find it too long so it doesn‚Äôt sit comfortably.

I‚Äôd buy from Amazon too, but only if it‚Äôs sold directly by amazon and they don‚Äôt fulfill orders for other sellers (‚Äòfulfilled by amazon‚Äô stock gets stored in the same place, so you might get something dodgy).

It's to make sure that the things you buy to stick in your vagina are safe and from trusted companies. If things look sketchy or are too cheap, don't buy it. If it has a bunch of 5 star reviews and then a bunch of 1 star reviews, don't buy it, especially if the 1 star reviews are reporting major issues.

Just because it says 100% medical grade silicone doesn't mean it is. A legitimate company will have contact info (including an address) easily available. There will often be reviews on other sites or YouTube.

There are tons of things where it's okay to be ""well this is cheap and probably crappy, but it's cheap enough that I don't really care if it breaks in two weeks."" Things you put in your various orifices are not one of them.

Offering a device that is supposed to be used internally and with *very* sensitive organs ans tissue, guaranteeing a product to be medical grade on all the marketing and source material is vital. The one thing more important than that is to actually provide it. Legally, this is just blatant lying to the customer, and leading them into a false sense of security and safety with what they use on/in their body. 


This also poses health risks. How would you feel if your piercer put just ""food grade"" steel in your brand new hole and guaranteed it to be the safer surgical steel? If you got an infection and found out later, leading to a complaint, he could be fired/barred from piercing under license/permit in most places. And OP couldn't have been the only one.

There is no ""pure medical grade silicone"" that is clear. The best we can do at the moment is translucent, or cloudy clear, like the Diva cup. If you see a cup (or for that matter, a sex toy) advertised as 100% silicone and it's clear like water, run far away. 

Note also that medical grade isn't necessary to be body safe. Food grade is fine since it's designed to not leach when in contact with water, ethyl alcohol, oil, and a few other substances. It's designed to be safe with mucous membranes, like your mouth, and your vagina (or butt). Medical grade means it's safe for implantation, which is a different ballgame.

Pretty sure OP could just take them to small claims for a refund and any medical bills. Dunno how that would work internationally though. If you want to really penalize the company, then you'd need not-small claims, but there's different ways OP could approach this and LA could at least point her in the right direction of an appropriate lawyer or court if she has a case.

And I'm skeptical that this is bad enough and widespread enough for a lawyer who works on class action cases to pick it up, but that's just speculation on my part. Like we're talking about what is probably just an individual or two drop shipping with a no name company, not a huge market scandal.

If any company is ""BBB Accredited"" on their BBB page its very likely you can get some help that route.

""BBB Accredited"" means they pay BBB every year for membership.  If you file a complaint BBB will contact the company and present the complaint, ask for a resolution, etc.  Most companies that pay for BBB membership don't want to lose rating and will provide a response.

[http://www.who.int/medical\_devices/definitions/en/](http://www.who.int/medical_devices/definitions/en/)Medical Device ‚Äì Full Definition

*‚ÄòMedical device‚Äô means any instrument, apparatus, implement,  machine, appliance, implant, reagent for in vitro use, software,  material or other similar or related article, intended by the  manufacturer to be used, alone or in combination, for human beings, for  one or more of the specific medical purpose(s) of:*

* *diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease,*
* *diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury,*
* *investigation, replacement, modification, or support of the anatomy or of a physiological process,*
* *supporting or sustaining life,*
* *control of conception,*
* *disinfection of medical devices*
* *providing information by means of in vitro examination of specimens derived from the human body;*

*and does not achieve its primary intended action by  pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, in or on the human  body, but which may be assisted in its intended function by such means.*

‚Äã

**Requirements in EU**

‚Äã

[http://www.ce-marking.com/medical-devices.html](http://www.ce-marking.com/medical-devices.html)

*For a number of products it is not clear if they are medical devices or not. There are a number of examples of products that* *may or may not be medical devices* *depending on the* ***Intended Purpose*** *for Use, assigned by the manufacturer to the products.*

*The following Toiletry and Cosmetics Products* *can also be* *Medical Devices if a medical claim is being made by the manufacturer for the device, although these products are* *usually not* *Medical Devices:*

* *tooth brushes, dental sticks, dental floss, dental chewing gums;*
* *baby nappies,* ***hygiene tampons,*** *mattress protectors*

‚Äã

‚Äã

‚Äã

Thus condoms (which I know are subject to relevant CE marking (93/42/EEC): *control of conception,*

Plasters: *treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury,*

I think that tampons / cups could be under: *modification, or support of the anatomy or of a physiological process*

But this is arguably less clear-cut (e.g. where would sports-bras, certain footware etc fall). Again **agree** that it should be subject to relevant safety and manufacturing standards as should all products that are in intimate or frequent contact with the skin.

Try different folds or putting it in at slightly different angles, you'll hopefully find something that works for you eventually.

While medical device directive may not apply in this case, I think REACH and some of the other regulations on materials known to cause harm to people come into play here.  Additionally, general product safety also applies.  

If the material making the device up has above the allowed limit of something on the SHVC list, then it's an instant import issue and likely to get reported on RAPEX (short hand for rapid exchange) and barred from import to the EU free trade area, of which the UK is part of.

I also believe from the product liability briefings I've sat through at product safety conferences, that failing a test for SHVC and putting that product on the market in the EU is grounds for catching some rather nasty legal issues.

Cups recomend no more than 13 hours but, lets be honest, on my last days, when my flow is suuuper light i keep the cup there 15 hours or so. You just need to take it out, rinse it or wash it with some soap and put it back in. 

How do you know they are full? Well, you dont. Obviously you cant see it, but, you can get an idea by comparing how long it takes for your pads or tampon needs changing. So, for me, i knew i had to change about every 6-7 hours so after those hours i checked my cup and yes, the cup was full (by checking i mean taking the cup out), so for my heavy day i checked at 5 hours and yes, it was full. So, what i am saying here is that you dont know exactky the first few times you wear it, because that depends on your flow, but you get the hang of it soon enough and you learn about how long it takes your cup to be full. 

There are other signs, for example, i feel bubbles, air scaping the cup when its about to overflow so thats when i now i need to change it NOW. Or some people feel the fullness of the cup, or that its starts riding lower, it really depends on your cup and yourself. It really takes just a couple of cicles to learn this things.

e4zg4wr,t1_e4zfljl,2018-08-28 17:07:23,TwoXChromosomes,"Two things then:

1. There is a learning curve so don't worry if it doesn't work for you immediately. There are different folds and techniques, so you're sure to get there in the end! You can always use it at home and something else while you're out until you get confident.

2. There is a myth that cups eliminate the risk of TSS. This isn't proven and there has been at least once case where a cup may have been involved. So, keep up good hygiene when changing and be gentle so you avoid internal abrasions. Some cups say you can use for 12 hours; Moon Cup says 8 and I stick to this.

Despite 2, it is still better - once you get the hang of it, it's way more comfortable (and often more convenient) than disposable options.",WoollenItBeNice,t2_141g73,4,0,reddit2

If you have a cup and don't still have the instructions, take a look on the manufacturer's website and see if they have details there - whether it can be boiled may be affected by what it's made of, so if I were you I'd check.

I use the tablets because I find it easier - drop part of a tablet into a container of water, dissolve, leave cup in for the specified time, rinse cup and container, leave to dry. So straightforward that you could do it in a hotel bathroom.",WoollenItBeNice,t2_141g73,2,0,reddit2

1. I get PMDD so week before I can be somewhat insane, depressed and can barely function. Being able to sit in a dressing gown, and also step outside for 5 mins fresh air and taking out commuter time and having to socialise means I can manage those symptoms. Also I have more time and energy to do exercises before/during/after work which has really helped. 
2. I can have a dodgy stomach any time but when I'm on I can literally poop 5 times in one morning. Without, again, having to worry about travel or shared bathrooms, it genuinely avoids me calling in sick being able to work in the privacy of my own home
3. Terrible cramp days. I used to take a hot water bottle in back in the office days, but again it was sometimes a reason I'd call in sick. Now I can sit in whatever weird position I need. Can therapeutically groan and moan as much as I like and get through the day. The not having to get work level presentable, or commute again helps as well. 

Honestly wfh has cured my sick leave (at least for period related issues, IBS flare ups which are my main problems.. Don't often get colds or seriously sick). These awful days are now manageable to juggle.

gxuges1,t3_nakrm7,2021-05-12 12:29:58,TwoXChromosomes,"Just wondering if you've ever tried (or heard of) a tens machine? 
For some people they can provide similar (or better) relief as heatpacks/hot water bottles. Except they're battery operated, and can be really discrete depending on the brand/type you buy. 
They usually have a little controller you clip on your pants or something, they can be really small and you can use them in ways that no one would know you had one on. 
They're not a complete cure of cramps for everyone because everyone is different, but I always like to comment and let people know about them incase they didn't already. I had been suffering horrible cramps that put me in hospital every few months, for 10 years before I learned about tens machines. 
They don't fix my cramps when they're really really bad, but on the most part a tens machine can allow me to do the shopping instead of crying in the shower, or walk into my doctor appointment instead of needing someone to help me. 
It didn't cure me, but most of the time they help me feel a bit more capable and comfortable than I usually would. And I rely on medication less (I still rely on medication, I just don't need to use it as frequently between flair ups)",eyafeawen,t2_4ufvqlk3,4,0,reddit3

If you feel comfortable discussing with your manager or HR rep, you could explain that you have been much more productive working from home especially while menstruating.  If they require ""proof from a doctor "" you might need to have a discussion with your GP as well, but I would think most companies trust their employees especially now we have had months of remote working and people have still shown to work effectively.

en3n404,t3_bn87xy,2019-05-11 08:31:30,TwoXChromosomes,"So here's the thing:

I had something like this happen at the site I work at. I'm security. I'm a woman. There are very few women who work at my site, especially my building. It's a warehouse that's been outfitted and reformatted for its current purpose of -REDACTED-

There also just so happens that, within what I may access, there is ONE women's restroom, two unisex bathrooms, and one men's room that has been outfitted to the freakin' nines. We're talking proper lockers, a shower, the WORKS since the past staff had long shifts. I suspect that they just re-outfitted the one bathroom that's the women's (that stays WAY more clean thus that is the one I use); shoved a toilet in there with a towel dispenser and that was it. No lockers. No feminine products. Nothing.

Last year we were told that we could no longer have bags by our stations, or put them in the cubbies that are in the hall. No, we were told that our bags had to be locked in our cars for our shift.

I called my boss and said quite plainly, that if me and the other women on site had an _accident_ on shift then it would be a real messy inconvenience to clean our uniform with getting tampons from our bags in the parking lot instead of putting our bags in the cubbies and being able to quickly retrieve it from there. I made a very fair case in that the bathrooms in that building were bereft of ANY feminine product dispenser and we would have to solely rely on our own to assist us. I got very descriptive in all the ways it could go wrong.

Not that long after I'm notified that we may use the cubbies to store our bags in.

I have since pointed that out to one of the women that works maintenance that even the unisex bathrooms in the other buildings were installed with women in mind: THEY had feminine products, so why not us?

She is currently working on pushing the installation in the women's AND the unisex bathrooms through. I've got my fingers crossed.

en3qd6v,t3_bn87xy,2019-05-11 09:27:06,TwoXChromosomes,"I would think the closest comparison would be having a packet of bandaids on your desk.

Edit: I said bandaid as they're both products used to absorb blood, made of cotton (and sometimes plastic), individual wrapped, then kept in a small box and often needed when they're needed. I mean, come on! It's just a stick of cotton!

People's comments on toilet paper are right. It's weird to keep toilet paper on your desk **but only** because it's already supplied in the bathrooms. If everyone who needed toilet paper needed to supply their own it probably wouldn't be weird to have it in your office/around your desk. 

Also it wasn't just sitting on her desk. It was in a drawer that happened to be made of mesh and is kind of see through. We don't know what the furniture scheme of the whole office is; it might have been the best option. Not to mention that tampon boxes are usually small brightly coloured boxes which could look like lots of things unless you're looking closely. 

And lastly, do they have a problem with other ""non professional"" items on desks? I work for a highly professional company, and I've had things like teapots, silly figurines, pics hanging up that aren't really professional and nobody has a problem with them. If this office is similar, then they shouldn't be getting upset over a box in a drawer. As long as it's not client facing, does it really matter?",ladylootalot,t2_cpssfmg,475,0,reddit4
en3wddi,t3_bn87xy,2019-05-11 10:55:46,TwoXChromosomes,"So. Office big wigs furnish the office with mesh drawers. Then get upset when they can see personal items in these mesh drawers?

Absolute genius'.

Not to mention. What are you doing in my office when I'm not there? I tend to have a ""YOU"" and ""ME"" thing when it comes to problems like this. I'll explain. If YOU are offended by MY products in MY drawer in MY office that YOU are in with out ME there and without MY permission, that sounds like a YOU problem. Notice how the only one in this equation that has a problem is YOU? MY products don't have a problem. MY drawer doesn't have a problem. MY office doesn't have a problem. ME? I don't have a problem. So that leaves....

This sort of thing happens all the time. Its no different then when people blame others for problems they caused on themselves. You see it all the time with people who are in a rush. It's everyone else's fault that they are late, because those other people are taking their time to do things (because they left on time), and not the rushers fault for leaving late. It's just self centered.

See something YOU don't like in MY office? Then feel free to have your impromptu meeting somewhere else. There. YOU have solved YOUR problem.

Now. I know some of you are gunna stick to your guns of ""unprofessional"" and such. But let's be honest. The only things unprofessional here is using a private office without permission, and then being upset that the furniture you picked doesn't properly hide that office users personal items. These people (VP and whomever) created this situation. And need to grow up and take responsibility for it.

OH. And what the heck do most of you do when you walk into a drug store and see an entire aisle of JUST tampons? Do you just close your eyes and pretend they don't exist? Grow up.

I think it said something when your boss didn't approach the argument about where it's appropriate to store personal hygiene items, but instead compare two tampons to condoms.  One of those is a personal hygiene item and the other relates to sexual activity.  

If your boss wants to say that they don't want any personal hygiene items or personal items on your desk that's probably ok for them to say.  IF it was clearly a pre-existing company policy that apply to all employees men and women alike.   If that isn't the case then likely some sort of discrimination is happening.  

You should have a reasonable place to store these items in your office.  They prefer it not be on your desk then they should provide or allow you another perfectly reasonable option.   

If they don't have a policy like I mentioned above them what they're doing is discrimination.

Someone's personal hygiene items were being stored in a drawer in their office.  

Another person was inappropriately and unjustifiably upset by viewing them and went to HR about something that should not have been a legitimate issue.    

The person who compared them to condoms was an idiot.   

There are only two potential ways this could have been handled appropriately:

1.  You would have been informed that there is an existing universal company policy that no personal items stored in an office can be visible.  (That they must be in furniture or containers that are not transparent etc...)  It would have been made clear that this policy applies to anyone regardless of gender/sex.

OR

2.  The male coworker who went to HR would have been informed that there is nothing wrong personal items, or personal hygiene items, being stored in the way that they were.

A person's cycle is still considered an intimate subject, a kind if privileged information. They asked that you remove it because it's clear that even speaking about it makes them uncomfortable. I see it as them stating that any object kept in plain view should be one comfortable enough for casual conversation within the office. Items related to menstruation are very private in that they are perceived as directly relating to the physical state of their owner. Were this not the case dispensers for items like this would be in the common area rather than cloistered away in women's restrooms, though I realize this placement provides other benefits as well.

Then again, I had two older sisters.  I got accustomed to seeing pads and tampons in various states when I was younger that I grew to understand it was 100% normal for females to have them lying around just in case.  Menstruation/childbirth in general just sucks so ya'll can do whatever you want (barring sloppy discard techniques in the restroom, I've heard quite a few horror stories from women over the years).  Been married for 10 years and was in plenty of relationships before that, don't even bat an eye at that stuff.  Women going through the same stuff really should understand as well.

I would argue that if you can buy it at a grocery store, which is *available to the general public of all ages*, then who gives a damn for the most part.  You can buy condoms at a grocery store too, but that's honestly different.  Guys don't *involuntarily* lose vital nutrients for x days per month during their entire cycle of fertility, so there is no male equivalent scenario and that's such an idiotic comparison to start with.  Displaying condoms at work could be construed as sexual harassment so it's just not a viable argument in any regard.  Tampons though?

They're not optional and people need them for strong hygienic reasons, but also not a proper topic of workplace conversation. The quibble about the toilet paper is that sometimes it does get mentioned, but only if the communal supply is gone, and then as a PSA.

Which particular hill are you thinking of dying on, precisely? Are you upset about the prohibition existing, about it not equally applying to men, or the inaccurate comparison? If the first, then I suggest you reconsider. That hill isn't worth visiting, ~~nevertheless~~ let alone dying on. We don't shame people for needing to defecate, but we also don't suffer people to bring up the topic in a professional environment unless it is particularly relevant. If your boss said to hide some TP you had sitting on your desk would that be a fight? The second is worth taking action on, but check that it exists first. Lack of perfect cognitive precision on a female VP's part does not present a clear case for workplace discrimination. Perhaps put some TP on your desk (or that of a cooperative male coworker) and see what happens. If you/he are told to hide it, you may conclude that you are dealing with prudes, not sexists. If the third...you're being more picky than is warranted or socially acceptable. If you insist on policing someone's reasoning in a situation where the alteration does not lead to a change of result, you will be met with universal irritation.

It's weird to keep toilet paper on your desk but only because it's already supplied in the bathrooms. If everyone who needed toilet paper needed to supply their own it probably wouldn't be weird to have it in your office/around your desk.

I used to work on an air force base, and during a period of insane budget cuts maintenance was reduced to weekly, and their budget for products (like toilet paper) was also reduced. At one point we went two months without any toilet paper being supplied in the bathrooms.

Just about everyone brought in their own rolls of TP. It became pretty standard that if you ran out, you'd just go to someone else and ask if you could borrow theirs. Rolls of TP on people's desks were super common.

So yeah-- when it's not supplied, people bring their own, and after a while it became just a normal thing to see rolls of TP everywhere.

And if they come at you with this insane condom comparison nip it in the butt and compare tampons with toilet paper or tissues. 
Just as no one wants to see a runy nose on a person they don't wanna see a bloody crotch or a wet crotch because you couldn't wipe yourself. And if they don't want you to store tampons in your office then they should provide the toilets with pads and tampons just as they do with toilet paper or allow the storage of them just as do with tissue.

Imagine you worked in an office that did not provide toilet paper. You need toilet paper as part of your daily functions, so you store some in a drawer at your desk that happens to not be completely opaque, allowing someone who enters your office and sits in your seat at your desk to tell there is toilet paper in the drawer.

Others in your office also keep their own toilet paper as well, because they need it too, but they choose to store it in different places.

A person in your office is then shocked because they can tell you have toilet paper stored at your desk when they are sitting at your desk in your office.

fso0hyq,t3_gvcz1r,2020-06-02 19:25:23,TwoXChromosomes,"Just speaking for myself here, I had some trauma around the births of both of my children.

With my son, I was trying to sleep during early labor. I woke up to find a nurse's hand between my legs. I groggily asked what was going on and she said ""just checking"" as she broke my water and placed an internal monitor on my son's scalp. I asked why she'd done that and she explained that I'd been moving around in my sleep too much and the monitor kept getting moved. About 8 hours later, a different nurse told me to stop pushing until the doctor said I could or she would hold the baby inside me (anyone who has given birth vaginally with no epidural can probably tell you it's near impossible to ""hold it in"" when the time comes.)

With my daughter, I wanted a better experience so I went with a midwife. Unfortunately, I had to be induced because I was so far past my due date. The midwife went with me to act as a doula. I'm so glad she was there because the on call OB wanted to do a c section and started to get aggressive when I said I would not unless she had a valid medical reason. She continued to act terribly toward me, telling me to keep quiet each time she was in the room (I was again giving birth with no pain medication so that was kind of difficult). When I felt the urge to push she came in and started telling me I needed to get on my back immediately while I was on my hands and knees in the middle of a contraction. I yelled at her to shut up so loud it sounded like a demon had possessed me. Once I got on my back, she quickly checked my dilation and declared I was not actually ready to give birth and ordered everyone out of the room even though the nurse was trying to tell her that I really was at a 10. About 20 minutes later the nurse came in to check on me and had to call the whole team back in because the baby was crowning. I made sure to report the doctor's behavior to the hospital, but she's been a doctor there for 20 years so I doubt anything happened.

fsnz7ut,t3_gvcz1r,2020-06-02 19:15:14,TwoXChromosomes,"I gave birth in a Navy hospital. It was an absolute nightmare (which I won‚Äôt go fully into unless someone wants me to), but I had to have a C-section (after the babies‚Äô positions were incorrectly identified and I was induced while one was breech...ugh). 

There was a problem with the epidural, and the docs acted like I was being whiny or difficult when I could still feel them punching me when they were seeing if I was numb enough for the cut. After that, I don‚Äôt remember much due to them overdosing me on drugs, except the feeling of my insides being literally rearranged while the doctor ‚Äútaught‚Äù his students what they could see while I was cut open. 

It was fucking terrifying and I would literally rather give birth in the back of a car than another US naval hospital.

Edit:  Since I've received a few requests for the horrifying story of one of the worst experiences of my life, here it is.  Sorry, this got kind of long...

I was induced into labor at 37 weeks, 5 days because one of my twin boys wasn't growing properly.  I went in to the hospital with my mom, who has been an obstetrics nurse for over 30 years (my husband was still on deployment for another week despite my airborne division's CO offering to fly him back, but that's another story).  

While you're in labor, they put these ultrasonic monitoring devices on your abdomen to track the babies' heart rates.  Think of a hockey puck-shaped device attached to a wide elastic belt that goes around you to hold it in place.  If you've ever seen or had an ultrasound, you know that they also have to have gel to ensure a good connection between instrument and victi--I mean, patient.

I am a small woman.  I was full term with twins.  My abdomen was like a blimp at the Macy's day parade and had skin as tender as our dear POTUS's feelings after someone calls him a mean name on Twitter.

Remember that gel?  And the belts?  I had to have THREE belts on me to find the little buggers' heart beats, with gel all around them.  When this gel dries, it is ITCHY.  Think of a bunch of aloe vera goop drying underneath a watch with an elastic watchband on top of a mild sunburn, except it was all over my (contracting, thanks to the pitocin drip) abdomen.  At one point I was literally in tears; it was 2 am and I couldn't sleep because my entire abdomen was itchy and painful and they came in to check on the monitors every half hour.  I can take high pain no problem, but the itchiness and soreness that increased by the hour was a special kind of torture.

Second day, they have me on the highest level of pitocin they can give me because these little darlings are resisting eviction.  My cervix is also not dilating.  So, and I swear I'm not making this shit up, they bring out The Tube.

The Tube is a rubber tube that they can inject saline into, which turns the end of The Tube into a smallish (hah) balloon.  They stuck The Tube in through my little cervix hole, inflated The Tube, tied a full IV bag to the other side of The Tube, and TOSSED THE BAG OFF THE END OF THE BED.  When they first explained this procedure to me, I laughed thinking they were joking, perhaps describing some sort of medieval torture device.  They were not. 

Every contraction would push The Tube through my cervix which, due to the weight of the IV bag, would forcibly ""dilate"" my cervix.

Also, may I note, this was a ""teaching hospital.""  This essentially meant that every single doctor on the floor would take their turn, standing in a LITERAL LINE, to fist my poor tortured not-so-private-anymore parts and finger my cervix.  Multiple times a day.

Finally, cervix is dilated, pitocin has been making me contract, fisting has been accomplished, but they STILL did not want to come out (surely a sign of how compliant they would be later in life).  So, the doc decided to break my water with something resembling a crochet hook.  This, of course, required an audience; I really felt like I was the warm-up act to a donkey show in Mexico.

Afterwards, they did an ultrasound to see what the presentation of the babies was.  They proudly proclaimed that one was still head down and the other at its feet,  so they could put a scalp monitor in the lower baby to monitor heartbeat and they could take two of my belts off (THANK YOU SWEET BABY JESUS).  The second day drug on with more awkward doctors mapping the inside of my vagina by feel, when it finally started hurting enough that they decided I ""could get"" an epidural.

The dudes come in to do an epidural.  Apparently, I am the last training epidural that the intern had to do!  Yay, I guess.  I crouch over, up comes my gown, and I feel the poke.  Then, I hear the one thing you never EVER want to hear when someone has a needle in your spine: ""Uh oh, oops.  Uh....what now?""  SOMEONE JUST SAID OOPS WHILE POKING A SHARP METALLIC OBJECT INTO THE MAIN NERVE HIGHWAY OF MY BODY.

Turns out, he had went in too far and now I had cerebrospinal fluid leaking out of where it was supposed to be, namely around my brain and spine!  This labor keeps getting more and more fun.  Now, instead of one wonderful epidural they can hook up and give me hours of relief from this hellish nightmare, I have to have a guy come in every hour and a half (""if he had time"") to top me up, so to speak.  Also, it did not work as well as a normal epidural.

Through all this, my mother is FREAKING THE FUCK OUT because everything is going wrong with her only child's high-risk birth (and being so experienced, she knew how it was SUPPOSED to go), and she is not a calm person at the best of times.  I am trying to remain calm myself through the pain, being used as a hand puppet by half the staff, and my mom being through-the-roof anxious and overbearing while also trying to get her to chill out.  

Early afternoon now, and they decide to do another ultrasound.  They have the monitor turned away so I couldn't see the screen, but I COULD see their faces as they looked at each other with  what I can only describe as an ""Oh, shit"" expression.  ""Uh, we need to do a C-Section.  Right now.""  They *said* that the baby above had stuck his arm between the baby loaded in the chamber and said exit of the chamber.  All I could do is feel the tears leak from my eyes as they wheeled me to the operating room.

(As it turns out, the lower baby was breech the whole time. The ‚Äúscalp electrode‚Äù ended up being on his butt.)

As I mentioned, the ""epidural"" didn't work that well.  They were pinching my abdomen to see if I could feel it, and acting like I was lying when I said I still could and that it hurt.  They gave me some medicine in my IV, waited a few minutes, and pinched again.   Still hurt.  They gave me more medicine, waited, pinched.  Still hurt.  Then, I hear one final ""oops"" from the staff; apparently the genius in charge of my IV *forgot* to open the clamp so nothing had actually gone in.

They opened the clamp, and that is pretty much the last thing I remember from my children's birth besides thinking *Why the fuck are they shoving a crying baby in my face??  Who is this baby?!*  I was also left with a vague memory of my lovely doctor using his best teaching voice to explain to the baby doctors standing around my cut open body what they could see, and a pulling, shoving sensation I can't even properly describe while he was rearranging my organs to suit his lesson better.

They whisked my newborn babies off to have a bath and left me in the recovery room.  Due to some stupid rule that I couldn't even SEE my babies until I could lift my butt off the bed by myself, I did not lay eyes on my kids until nearly FOUR FUCKING HOURS after they'd been born.

The next day, I developed the most severe headache that I have ever had in my entire life every time that I sat upright.  I've had migraines, but I have never experienced something like this before.  Turns out, my cerebrospinal fluid was still leaking out through the needle hole in my spine, so my brain was basically sitting on the ""floor"" of my skull so to speak.  

Lucky me got to try a new experimental treatment for this, which worked!  For like two weeks.  Afterwards, the headaches came back and I had to go back into the emergency room so that they could take blood out of my arm and inject it into my spine to form a clot.  This was done at like 11 o'clock at night in a completely deserted and dark patient bay with lights only directly over me, so it was honestly a 50/50 shot whether I was going to get treated or get my organs harvested.  Luckily, I came out with a new shiny clot in my spine and an intense hatred for the United States Military Medical System.  

Seriously, if you're in the service and are going to give birth, do whatever is necessary to avoid doing it in a naval hospital.  I was honestly not even joking when I said I would rather give birth in the back of a car.

I didn't even know what was wrong with me or that I was in a life threatening situation, I was just informed that I needed a c-section right now and I basically had no choice. My husband was informed that his wife and/or baby may not survive this surgery after I'd been taken off to surgery and I was told by my actual Dr the day after. I then was not allowed to see my baby for 37 hours and even after I was allowed to see her, the treated seeing my own child in the NICU as some sort of privilege I had to earn.

If I had been given even a small amount of information by the Dr, I would have done it. If I'd been treated with any respect, the experience probably wouldn't have been as traumatizing as it was. I was on magnesium and they didn't want the hassle of loading me into a wheelchair so they separated a mother from her baby.

When I had my son 2 months ago, it was a little bit better bc the on call OB wasn't a garbage human. I was in labor with regular  contractions 6 minutes apart but wasn't dialating at all. Like, 0cm after 4 hours. She gave me options, told me what she thought was best and I ended up going with her recommendation of giving up on VBAC, which she was genuinely sadder than me about, and got another c-section.

My son was at term, but he needed a short NICU stay as well. I had a little trouble getting to see him at first, but it only took one call to the shift nurse to resolve. It was just as the hospital was locking down, so things were weird. This time I had a bad hemorrhage and lost 2.5L of blood, plus what I lost during surgery. I was a hair away from needing a transfusion, I had to have clots manually scraped out of my uterus with a doctor's hand while she casually told me that my pelvis was way too small and I'd have probably needed a c-section anyway. Nurses had to push hard on my uterus every 15 minutes to try and clear the clots. It was so painful.

Thankfully after a battery of tests, my doctors discovered it was an ovarian cyst the size of a golf ball.

I was not yet sexually active, and my pain was 100% confirmed to be the cyst, which was nearly 95% going to go away on it's own in a day or so without any issue. The OBGYN on staff, a 50-something year old man, mentioned that ""he was going to need to do a pelvic exam"", and when my mother protested, he insisted that it need to be done.

Clearly I was freaked out, and moments prior to the exam, the doctor checked my pulse and said ""It's a little high, but I'm sure it's just because she's excited."" BECAUSE. SHE'S. EXCITED. When I think back to this moment, it makes my blood boil. My mother looks back to that day with regret; he was a medical professional so she felt there was nothing she could do.

I'm lucky to have been without many health issues in my life, but when they started popping up a few years ago thanks to what I am convinced is hormonal changes, I realized how broken and disgusting the system is.  

I went into a clinic for assistance because I had been lying prone for 3 days panting in severe and abnormal pain and was finally able to get up and go out for help...the doctor at the clinic did some tests and then referred me to the ER.  The ER doctor finally saw me, did an unenthusiastic exam and said ""why are you even here...I can give you something for the pain if that's what you want, but this isn't a medical emergency so I don't know what I can do for you"".  I was taken aback at that reaction and didn't know what to say, so after a moment of shock, I looked him square in the eye and said ""I don't want drugs...this is abnormal pain, it's severe, and I want to know what's wrong with me"".  He shrugged, told me there was nothing he could do, and walked away.  Despite speaking with several doctors, I still don't know what was wrong with me.

fsp9xfo,t3_gvcz1r,2020-06-03 01:54:21,TwoXChromosomes,"I am a labor and delivery nurse for a CNM group. I cannot recommend the website ‚ÄúEvidence Based Birth‚Äù enough. Read and research from evidence based sources, ask questions, and tell your provider ‚Äústop!‚Äù if something doesn‚Äôt feel right or you need clarification. In my experience with low to moderate risk birth, there are very few times actual emergencies happen where we can‚Äôt take 30 seconds to explain to you what is going on. 

Please know, most providers are lazy. Laboring in the bed is easy. Laboring with continuous or internal monitors is easy. Epidurals are easy. Having IV access makes it easy for us to suggest meds. Natural, unmedicated labor with intermittent Doppler auscultation is HARD for a provider. A birth outside of the bed is HARD for the provider. Letting a woman dictate her care with the most unbiased evidence and education available, means that your provider has to be flexible AND educated. Stand your ground‚Äîdocs want to leave the hospital ASAP, hospitals want to turn over the bed, nurses are burnt out and want to be out of your room as much as possible. Ask what are the pros and cons to me and my baby for every offered intervention. Educate yourself on how long natural labors take, positions to facilitate labor (spinning babies!!), and what a low risk delivery looks like. (Spoiler alert- it takes a lot of time and requires very few vaginal exams!!) 

Doulas are amazing people. They have a passion for people and evidence based care. A good doula can help you navigate a low-risk birth in a high-risk environment. They can advocate for your wishes. They can help you transition through a low to high risk situation when complications arise. Even though covid prevents doulas from coming in the delivery room, get her on FaceTime! Call her!

DEMAND delayed cord clamping and skin to skin after birth for at least one hour. REFUSE to let any provider take your baby ‚Äúfor an exam‚Äù, ‚Äúfor his shots,‚Äù ‚Äúfor his bath,‚Äù ‚Äúto weigh her,‚Äù ‚Äúto get you cleaned up‚Äù unless it‚Äôs an emergency or you want to. Separating you from baby allows more interventions to occur and prevents normal stabilization of the infant, breastfeeding, and bonding. YOU MADE THAT BABY! KEEP THAT BABY ON YOUR CHEST! IT IS YOUR BABY. 

Remember, you have the right to fire any caregiver that comes in your room. Ask to speak to the charge nurse or unit nurse manager if you have concerns about your care, at any time. (Often times those in charge are aware of problem docs and nurses and can‚Äôt wait to nail their asses to the wall). And furthermore, most hospitals have a complaint/quality assurance dept. Do not leave the hospital until you have spoken to a charge nurse, unit nurse manager, house supervisor on duty, or quality/complaint team!! 

Last note. Birth trauma is real and can lead to postpartum depression. Remember that you and your family deserve education throughout your entire birth. You deserve a conversation with your provider whenever you want. You deserve and should debrief you‚Äôre labor and delivery with your provider. Seek psych care postpartum if you need to talk.",olshakeyhands,t2_gn25k,106,0,reddit1

Hiring a doula helps, but definitely do your research, tour hospitals, ask a lot of questions and trust your gut.

I had a scheduled cesarean for breech presentation. And while I was disappointed that I had to have a cesarean, it was like a beautiful dance where everyone there knew their roles so well, and I felt so taken care of by all. Also it was very empowering, everyone save my husband and one surgical assistant in there was female. My OB who performed the cesarean asked me about my dream the night before, so I ended up telling her some wild story while she operated. It went very quickly, I didn‚Äôt feel any pain during the cesarean. Everyone was concerned for my comfort, they laid my daughter on my chest while I was being stitched back up.

I was lucky enough that my OB was the one on staff when my induction was (finally, after 19 hours) successful and we'd discussed this at length. I looked at the nurse after I signed that paper and told her quietly that if my grandmother (who delivered me, my brother, was an CNA, RN, and hospice nurse in her 63 years on this planet and acted as my Doula) saw anyone come at me with a scalpel and neither me nor my son were in danger, she was going to knock them the fuck out. The nurse told me she was on my side and hates that we have to sign that stupid paper.   


I'd explained to my OB that I wanted two things: to tear naturally, and to avoid C-Section at all costs. Surgery is a fear of mine, and anyone with basic first aid knowledge knows that scrapes heal faster than cuts. I was high risk for preeclampsia and was being induced because my BP was dangerously high when I went for my last growth scan. I had my son a week early to the day. My grandmother defended me from the horrible lactation consultant who manhandled my breasts and my son's poor little hour old neck and jumped to my defense even before my fiance got the chance to open his mouth. All my doctors and nurses at my hospital were delightful otherwise, and they sat and talked to me in hushed whispers the first night I stayed to help calm me down, to try to dissuade my fears. It really isn't every hospital that falls under this bloody umbrella, and certainly not every nurse and doctor. I have never been one to shy away from my needs being met medically, and I'm certainly lucky to have such strong people behind me should I falter in being my own advocate.

fspm9nn,t3_gvcz1r,2020-06-03 03:56:28,TwoXChromosomes,"No one will probably read this but I feel the need to share  

I've had three babies and one miscarriage. 

My first baby I had in Germany and they assign you a nurse midwife throughout your labor to help you through contractions. (she would have been replaced after her shift but my labor progressed rapidly). She was amazing, gave counter pressure on my hips for each contraction, fed me ice, spoke in a calm voice and was just there for me. Even with the language barrier that labor with no epidural but lots of pitocin I felt heard, understood and cared for. 

My second baby was delivered in California, I picked a random doctor that had lots of good reviews for high risk patients. He ended up being having his clinic in a random strip mall so I didn't expect much with this doctor but was pleasantly surprised. He listened and the NP there was awesome during my million NSTs and the phlebotomist was ahhhmazing, I hardly felt the needle when he would draw my blood.

I was induced at 37 weeks for baby #2 because of him being measured larger by a perinatologist. (he was 9lbs and 14 oz at birth). My cervix was prepped with that weird coiled med and I was given pitocin. Eventually, I had an epidural and Dr would come in and check on me, he would ask permission to check my cervix. It was awesome, I hit 10 cm the nurse was like ""let's do some test pushes"" while on the phone with him and I did a good push and nearly scared the phone out of the nurse as she said ""she's a really good pusher you better get here quick!"" And then the army of nurses and doctors came in and I had my baby shortly thereafter. 

About a year later I miscarried. I still remember walking back to the military clinic room from radiology and the doctor coming in to tell me. She was amazing and compassionate and she confirmed again with another ultrasound. I eneded up having a D&C and each person I talked to there was empathetic and understanding. 

For my 4th pregnancy I was high risk, developed gestational diabetes  early on and was switched to the med school here in Nebraska. There they have like 5 different doctors on that OB team. I had good care from two of them. I didn't feel heard or respected from any of the others. Since it was a teaching hospital there were student nurses and med students and residents during my delivery. Again, I was induced at like 1am in the morning, I eventually had pitocin, the foleybulb placed, epidural and then my waters broken. It worked awesome and was probably my easiest delivery. The nurses were great and communicated with me about how to get this baby out.  The doctor on call was one of the good ones and his resident delivered and was awesome. He communicated with me asked if it was okay to check my cervix and walked me through his exam and  when to expect ""pressure"". - communication! 

The three doctors that I didn't like we're shitty because one called my cervix evil while stuffing his entire hand into my vagina because it was ""not where it should be"". Another disregarded my pain and discomfort because she's had babies too and it isn't that bad. And the last one was just felt ill-equipped to being a doctor with multiple non answers and incomplete information and I later found out she was a DO not an MD so I guess it made sense. 

I share my stories because it is possible for doctors to be human and treat their patients with compassion, understanding and to communicate effectively without being overbearing or controlling  I'm very lucky to have the experiences I've had especially with being tied to the military and hearing the horror stories within.

 I had a doctor decide what he was going to do even before I was half way though my labour.  (Trigger warning here) He gave me an episiotomy without consent and I almost died because I hemorrhaged after they tore my baby from my uterus using forceps.   With my second baby he was big and breech and the doctor repeatedly pressured me into scheduling a C section. He turned and was born the day before I was supposed to be induced.  During my labour she asked if some students can come in and observe. I was completely out of it and consented without knowing what was going on. One of the students tried to painfully stretch my labia even though I never consented to it. With my third  I had to beg the nurses not to push my legs up by my head because I was afraid of tearing and of injuring my hips and pelvis because I have Elher  Danlos (I know.. I cant spell.. ) and I didn't want my legs and pelvis to dislocate. With each baby the muscles get more and more stretchy and this is a really big danger.

I and traumatized with all my births.  I even had a miscarriage and the doctor didn't believe me because they took a urine sample and it had blood in it (duh! I was having a miscarriage) He didn't believe me. He performed an ultrasound on my kidneys. Then made me come back for an ultrasound to be performed by an actual tech and the tech was the one who had to tell me that my baby was gone. 

This is why women end up not going to the hospital. This is why we die more often during birth. This is why we are scared to speak up to our doctors.  
I had one female doctor tell my that this is my body and therefore my choice. I cried during that appointment.

Also, asking a doula‚Äôs perspective on labor is like asking the doorman how to run the restaurant. You can become a doula after having one instructional birth and then being in the room maybe for a couple more, not necessarily required. 

That‚Äôs compared to having a bachelor‚Äôs degree in a STEM concentration, 4 years medical school, then 4 years residency, then potentially 1-4 years subspecialization, usually working >80 hours per week at the hospital then studying and doing research at home, every week of that journey. 

A doula does not understand acid-base changes in uteroplacental insufficiency or cytokines release from artificial rupture of membranes, they also aren‚Äôt monitoring up to 30 other patients simultaneously, they get to stand around and talk about breathing and being friendly and have never had to ask themselves how much longer a baby can wait before developing cerebral palsy vs. making an episiotomy, knowing that if you don‚Äôt make it, the perineal laceration May be so bad that it causes nerve damage I. The rectum leading to stool incontinence. 

I have a really strong rapport with my patients (also I don‚Äôt like doing episiotomies, and rarely do them, unless there‚Äôs an emergency or it‚Äôs obvious that the perineum is going to tear in an uncontrolled manner without one: in which case episiotomy is less damage than the natural laceration), I always describe what and why I‚Äôm doing every step of the way, that‚Äôs something I LOVE about my job, but the patient that thrashers around on the bed screaming and arching her back after saying they wanted a natural child birth without epidural may have read some anecdotal blog about back pain, but she probably didn‚Äôt read about shoulder dystocia and brachial plexus nerve damage or anoxic brain injury.

Of course there are bad situations and issues of malpractice that have occurred, but this is definitely not the norm.  The reason a lot of doulas find these experiences inappropriate is because they are not medical experts and don't understand the medical emergencies that happen during birth and the treatment they require.

Giving birth can turn into an emergency where seconds can make the difference between life and death.  You cannot plan a birth despite best wishes.  The overwhelming majority of the time, the medical team is only concerned about the best outcome for the mother and the baby.  

Articles like these are just meant to scare women and cause controversy.  They don't offer real solutions or advice.

I work night shift and even fairly healthy people will sometimes desaturate in deep sleep to 87/88% (normal is 92 or above).  It is fairly benign but the way the monitors work sometimes we cannot change the alarm parameters and they will alarm, which can be alarming to patients.  The monitors also do not always pick up properly due to positioning. A couple deep breaths will help bring the sats up and stop the alarms. We can also see respiratory rate on the monitors and when we go into a room, we asses if the patient is in respiratory distress. If she wasn‚Äôt in active distress and her respiration‚Äôs were ok, there probably wasn‚Äôt much else needing to be done for a mild desaturation except maybe give some oxygen via nasal canula if the desat is persistent.

I was admitted less than an hour before shift change, so the duty OBGYN suggested I chill for a bit and make plans when the daytime OBGYN started her shift, since she had over 30 years of experience doing breech deliveries. I reviewed my options with her and I decided to attempt a vaginal birth. As part of this decision making process, I agreed to an IV and epidural, in case something started to go badly and I needed to be put out immediately for a super-emergency c-section.

There I was, flat on my back on a table in the operating theatre (in case of the aforementioned potential surgery), with every member of the L&D staff the OBGYN could grab, every med student and resident she could find, and the machine that goes PING!

The OBGYN tells me she's going to run a catheter line up to my bladder really quickly, just to make sure my bladder is empty so that it doesn't present an obstruction to my baby, who clearly can't figure out the best way to be born when left to her own devices. It didn't sound pleasant, but I'd had an epidural, so what the hell did I care?

Well, I screamed when she inserted the cath line. Then she said ""you're not supposed to be able to feel that."" Then I said ""Did I ever mention my epidural with my first didn't take properly, either?"" Then she made awkward eye contact with me from the scenic vista of my crotch and we got on with the business of getting 7¬Ω lbs of infant to vacate my body in a safe and orderly manner.

She visited with me after they resuscitated my daughter and we were recovering, and told me that learning my epidural wasn't working properly scared the shit out of her, and checked to make sure we were okay.

Instead of describing experiences of abuse from only the doula's perspective (someone who has no medical expertise), they should offer a physicians perspective so women can truly understand what can happen during labor.

Sorry, if you did. It's hard to tell people's intentions on the internet.

*Edit:* since some people are upset it seems like my comment wasn't clear. I'm saying that there are many doctors (not necessarily most) who ignore women's concerns and problems and also act as if black people don't really feel pain. Here are some articles:

fsoeq4w,t1_fso4yyw,2020-06-02 21:16:27,TwoXChromosomes,"I anaesthetise for C-Sections. 

It can be VERY difficult at times to assess block density. You're faced with a scared, exhausted woman who has never been in this situation before and is suddenly whisked away from her room into an alien environment surrounded by people in gowns/masks who have a sense of urgency about them. 

We try and coach people what to expect - might feel pressure but shouldn't feel pain. Might feel ""rummaging"" at at times sometimes discomfort. We don't like doing general anaesthesia as there's a much higher risk for mother and baby.

To assess the efficacy of the block we're supposed to test in three phases - to cold, light touch and pin prick. Sometimes the woman is in tears and non-cooperative, sometimes the surgeons are so worried about the baby they've already started to prep and drape. 

I've had cases when dabbing a woman's abdomen with some cotton wool has caused her to yell out ""it's sharp, it's sharp"" due to the adrenaline flowing and hyper-vigilance. 

Sometimes we have to use our best judgement and make a decision to start the C-Section or abandon the spinal/epidural and convert to a general. It's not about not believing what the woman says, it's about trying to objectively put her experience into context and make a professional decision whether to proceed or not in a time pressured environment where a babies health is at risk. There's often a balancing act between giving permission for that first incision and risking the baby being born dead or profoundly disabled. 

Personally I think much more emphasis on labour epidurals and C sections should be taught at the pre natal classes. It might help provide a bit of context at 4am when they're being pushed down the corridor. Unfortunately in the UK they're run by the midwifery teams and we don't get to see the women unless they're particularly high risk or coming for an elective C Section",FentPropTrac,t2_fzyvk,362,0,reddit1

I was a white kid in a liberal part of California the 80's and was told that Black people don't feel pain like White people because they are violent creatures. This was said while explaining the reason for higher arrest and prosecution rates for black people. This was said by multiple people in authority.

I never went to med school and don't know what they taught. However as a population when enough youth are told these types of lies at a young age and repeated by people in authority it's easy to see how this is an example of white supremacy.

I'm in my forties now and I still hear older than me people repeating these lies at places like the dog part, these are strangers, they use stats from the 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s. They are so comfortable making declarations like this in public. These same people are the ones who say the USA is too politically correct and it wouldn't be surprising if these were the same people who are protesting social safety rules of wearing face masks and closing down sports arenas/bars.

My usual counter argument to these older men and women if they had read any FOIA reports from decade past showing black people were targeted as the scapegoats for many crimes. Not once have they said yes.

They never believe me. But over there years I've had more people back me up when having these conversations instead of trying to tell me to be quite because it's not my place to say anything.

>>  SILVERSTEIN: Well, there was a follow-up that was done, and it basically then tried to look at white people, it tried to look at black people and it also tried to look at nurses and nursing students 'cause this is a big problem that we have with black people not getting pain medicine when they need it the most. And what these researchers found was that all of the participants, white, black, nurses, nursing students, all assumed that black people felt less pain than white people.

>> And what they said was, well, it doesn't really make sense to say that racial prejudice or animosity is entirely to blame here. It may be something else. And when they pressed on this, they started to see that it had a lot to do with whether or not participants assumed that black people in the study had faced more hardship or more adversity. And basically, what they ended up seeing was that they felt that black people could just sort of take more pain. And we can see how this - it just creates this cycle of pain, then. Right?

>> We have this assumption that because black people have been hardened by certain life experiences, that they can deal with more pain or they feel it less intensely, and therefore, they're forced to endure even more.

No one is perfect, but he's not owning his stuff whatsoever. He knows how to plead, he does not know how to actually take responsibility. Imagine him smoking weed while watching you go to work to pay for it.

And now.... she's getting ready to leave him.

For example in my state any savings accrued during the marriage is basically split in half upon divorce. If you stay married to him for another 10 years and end up with 400k in retirement, do you want to give him 200 of it?",TooooMuchTuna,t2_3xegldz7,4,0,reddit3

My wife and I have been married ten years. I have not been able to work the past 3 years due to MS symptoms and severe nerve pain in my feet. My wife, on a teacher's salary, pays for everything at the moment.

It absolutely kills me. We are getting by, but I feel horrible about it. I also do most of the house chores because I feel any less would be an insult to how amazing and supportive my wife has been. I couldn't imagine her buying me any extra luxuries like weed. I even try to eat less, strictly shop by sales etc. Anything I can do to help. I believe that's what should be done. Minimizing my burden. Thanks to finally getting pain management, I'm at a tolerable level most days. I believe I am close to getting back to work. I actually enjoy it in my field(IT).

My dad rarely worked. My mom worked herself to literal death supporting us(my dad and two sisters). She ignored her body because she couldn't miss work. She eventually went and got diagnosed with hemorrhoids. Turns out, she actually had rectal cancer and died from it several years later. Perhaps treatable if caught earlier.  To this day he doesn't work. Draws survivor benefits from her work credits. Out of the 34 years I've been alive, he has worked maybe 5-8 of them. 

My point is, if he is able bodied, he should absolutely work. He shouldn't be allowed any extras from you. It upsets me that he is taking advantage of your hard work and kindness. You should cut him off from everything except the basics if you give him a final chance. If he refuses to hold a job after this, he will never. He has already shown it's not likely. I can't speak to how you feel about him, but he doesn't respect you based off your post. You can do so much better, hell, you would be better off in your own.

Sadly, the short answer is that he doesn't want to. He wants a bang maid and a mommy. That's  what a lot of men want. 

He will never change. He will only ever try short term solutions to get you to let him back so he can do it again and again. 

Ten years seems like a long time but twenty would be a longer time to waste on him. 

Let him go. If he maintains his changes for a year *without bothering you to prove what he's done*, then I think you can reconsider if you want.

He was having panic attacks at his job that he hid from everyone.  When he had to quit when we moved he wouldn't get a job.  I was frustrated, would make comments about job openings, and tell him to put applications out.  It took him months, and lots of fighting over it, and therapy on his part before he broke down and told me. We readjusted our life style.  We don't have kids, but he's still a stay at home.  He does all the domestic work (I'll help after work), runs errands and all that plus he does a lot of refurbishing work on our house.

And for 4 years, did not work at all. Mostly food delivery with the biggest pile of shit cars. So then I am paying to fix his car so he can go work to make $75.

I paid all the bills, bought all the groceries, did all the cleaning, and raised my 2 girls while he played ages of empires and smoked weed. When my tax return came, he told me I needed to pay his weed man because he had been getting FRONTED for an entire year. My large refunds that went to paying up bills that fell behind thru the year, a sizeable chunk went to some dealer. 

When I tell you, the day I had my (now) husband come over, on a night the girls were at my parents, change the locks on every door. Rekeyed everything. Ring doorbell on the front porch also installed. I slept for 20 hours. It was a constant fight or flight reflex that finally got to die down. I had money left after checks. Not much, but more. 

My ex used me until he couldn't. Then when I left, he threatened the guy I started dating (re:now husband), trying to spook people away so that I would eventually cave and take him back. Now my ex has 5 years probation for aggravated stalking, and is out of the picture and I have not had to see or speak to him since 2020.

To be clear, kicking somebody to the streets without warning is an act of domestic abuse. As is calling the police, or any other state agency (say mental health services) for the purposes of exercising control over the person in the absence of any actual need to do so.

You can end a relationship for any reason. But you cannot financially pull the rug out from your partner, leaving them destitute, as a method of coercing whatever behaviour from them you find desirable.

Women need to stop giving men money because the moment you give a man money he becomes your son, and you start feeling bad whenever you put your foot down because now you think he can‚Äôt survive without you.

Let me tell you what this is like from the perspective of someone who grew up in a household with a jobless dusty father who left the entire financial well being up to my mum: it sucked so much, i hate my dad, i hate the fact that my mum stayed in the marriage even though she was so beautiful she couldve gotten exactly what she wanted in life, i hate the fact that now that my mum is older she is suffering the effects of marrying a dusty broke unmotivated person, she doesnt have savings because she used it all on the family (and his broke ass) and she has never said anything but im sure she regrets.

Even if it may not look like it, you have a choice in your life, you are not powerless, grab your life in your hands and take control of it, he has shown you that you can absolutely live without him, prove him right.

Right now, though, she seriously needs to move to cut him out of her life entirely, block him on Social Media (putting out a statement outlining her side of the situation, before he can start ""poisoning the well"" with their friends & family), get her locks changed & get a Divorce Lawyer (having them prepare an application for a restraining order to stop her ex-husband's harrassment). It's inevitable that when this super entitled, self-centered, asshole realises that his cushy existence is at an end, he'll viciously lash out at his ex-wife - perhaps violently, but certainly verbally & abusively... 

She also needs to immediately check that he hasn't been leeching away Her personal savings, taken out any loans/credit cards in Her name, or mortgages on Her house. If they have a shared bank account, she needs to take out Her half of what's in there (yes, I know she probably earned it all, but as long as they're married it's community property & she can only justify taking half to prevent him taking it all) & the same with any investments. Of course, following her lawyer's advice on the best way to do all of this. Otherwise OP's ex-husband may end up destroying Her Credit Rating - something that's utterly devastating in America.

Does anyone know if she could be liable for some sort of Alimony to support him when she divorces him? I'm unsure how the legal system works in America - especially in her State. Perhaps her lawyer can help her show her ex-husband's pattern of abusive behaviour (financial abuse at the very least, if not gaslighting) to the court to prevent this from occurring...

Lastly, whether or not he does his usual performance of:

    ‚óâ Pretending to get another job, 
    ‚óâ Pretending to work to the best of his ability,
    ‚óâ Pretending be responsible (even as he quits or is fired again), 
    ‚óâ Pretending to care about her feelings (when he clearly thinks of her as his inferior, a lowly peasant who is only there to provide for his lifestyle),
    ‚óâ Pretending that he isn't an Entitled, Narcissistic, Parasite who's been grifting off her for years,

should really be irrelevant to her. He's done the dance all before & he'll do it all again...

That's just how Psychopaths are: They lack empathy, are deeply self-centered & are incapable of learning from experience.

and

>Am I going to spend the rest of my life being treated this way?  
>  
>No.

>So how much time am I going to spend being treated this way before I leave?

I'm sorry he won't let you have the relationship you want with him. But you need to accept that fact and begin grieving the relationship you wanted with/and the man you hoped and/or thought he would be. You can't fix him -- he doesn't want to be fixed.

But I promise, you don't even realize how much weight you are under. You feel like you're carrying a huge burden but it's way bigger than you realize when you're stuck in it. When I finally left my ex behind and drove off to the rest of my life, I felt like I had been carrying a giant pallet of concrete blocks on my back and I just cast it off. I felt like I opened my arms to the sky -- no, better. I felt like I could SEE the sky again after being unable to for so long, and it was glorious. I was FREE. And you will be too. You just have to process and grieve.

When I was with my ex, I knew I had been happier before (and that I'd be that happy again, after I left her). I had a little graph in my head like in math class: difficulty on the vertical axis, time on the horizontal. When I was with my ex, difficulty was high, and breaking up was a hump that was hard to start going over. But on the other side of that hump, difficulty was WAY lower. I just had to get over the hump to get to it.

It's going to suck, I'm sorry. Lean on your friends and family; get back in contact with the ones you haven't seen in a while. Apologize for being away, tell them about how you're leaving him, and make yourself make plans and keep them. Humans are social creatures; the more time you spend with your social support, the better off you'll be.

There's a way through this. You can do it. You won't feel this way forever.",lynn,t2_6f32,1,0,reddit3

jubl7ol,t3_15ex8rl,2023-08-01 09:37:07,TwoXChromosomes,"Let me share you the tale of two partners. Some caveats, I'm a lesbian, and my previous partner, J had a job for maybe six months out of the 11 years we were together? My current partner, C, is disabled and has never worked in the 2.5 years we've been together.

When J and I got together, they had a job, and indicated they'd be in a job or in school the entire time we'd be together. When C and I got together, we discussed openly the possibility of them not working and focusing on their health. It was my idea. As time went on, I got student loans to help pay for school, and whenever that enabled J to quit work, they did, regardless of the potential financial strain it would put on us. C took it upon themselves to manage the budget and help us both pay off our debts, on my income alone, while making sure both of us had fun money left over. J resisted all attempts to get on therapy, to learn how to budget, to go back to work, to fix their credit, if I wanted any of these things to happen, I had to take charge of it. C has taken initiative on finding their own therapist, engaging in and furthering their own education, picking up hobbies. J would not take charge of their health. Health problems would languish until they became urgent care visits. C had taken charge of their health and found doctors, specialists, and asked for help when needed, usually in the form of me yelling at doctors for them. J would hide their substance use, hide how much alcohol they were drinking, hide weed purchases, smoke an eighth in a weekend, then get pissed off when I wouldn't buy more until our next paycheck. We were kept on the brink of poverty so that we'd always just barely make rent, but never actually be able to make enough for me to, for example, send them to rehab. C has been worried that they're out of control despite taking months to go through a single eighth.

I tell you all this to illustrate: his unemployment is not itself the problem, its the lack of care he has for himself or you. So long as you're more interested in him improving himself, getting a job, doing the housework, or _being a partner_ than he is, you don't have a partner, you have a child.

jubsun5,t3_15ex8rl,2023-08-01 11:07:56,TwoXChromosomes,"This is unfortunately not an uncommon trait. Usually guys who were spoiled children that were catered to by their moms and never made to grow up. They get into relationships and expect their partners to take care of them like they're accustomed to. When that doesn't work they go back home to their mom.

You can't change him. He has to want to change. Something very unlikely to happen so long as he has a safety net to fall back on.

I was like this in my younger years for the same reason. I did eventually change and grow up but only after losing my family, my safety net, experiencing homelessness, losing my freedom for ~18 months, and then battling cancer for 3 years. It took losing everything and facing my own death to convince me I needed to change.

Even all that isn't a guarantee someone will change. I knew a lot of guys in prison who'd lost everything and only doubled down on their behaviors. Many people aren't even capable of the kind of introspection needed to make big changes like that. Or their egos won't allow it.

Long story short is that you can't change him. He has to want to change. He's definitely not gonna change if he keeps getting away with his behavior. If you want something to change in your life then you need to make the change. If what he's doing isn't acceptable to you then remove him from your life.

One mantra you need to repeat to yourself any time you find yourself wavering about letting him back in: ""Enabling others never gets them better or me"" and repeat it as often as possible. Let this man be someone else's problem, learn to enjoy your own company, and if you in the future at all decide to date again never ever put up with them treating you like a sugar momma or a mom.

This guy is done. He's not finding work and seeing a therapist to improve himself, he's doing it to try and get his meal ticket back. That means nothing he does will stick and you are correct, the nanosecond you let him back in - even if he's been in a job for two years and lived on his own successfully - he will revert to quitting and letting you pick up the slack. And I say that in part, because frankly he's dumb. Self-entitled people who bite the hand that feeds them over and over again are just dumb and unfortunately too often they substitute manipulation for intelligence. And being that level of dumb means they never learn anything except, ""I've faked it and she always picks up the slack, so I just have to wait it out while she continues to do so."" 

He wasn't smart enough to know a good thing when he had it and work at keeping it. You cannot teach intelligence and therapy done because it's being used as a manipulation tool is worthless, less than worthless actually since it often becomes weaponized. Let him go be someone else's problem whether it's his own or some other poor sap of a woman he ropes in.

They like that the person makes them look a certain way, or feel a certain way, not because they actually like the person. In your case, it seems that your partner simply likes that he doesn‚Äôt have to work. That‚Äôs what he values, and in his eyes, you‚Äôre the perfect partner because he gets that from you. He probably thinks you‚Äôre the perfect fit or something. It‚Äôs not actually about you, it‚Äôs that his feelings of loved are fueled by benefit. I‚Äôm sure he thinks he loves you, but that‚Äôs because his definition of love is warped. This type of love is easily the cruelest, coldest, most devastating love.

Go no contact since he could be narcissistic but he definitely was emotionally abusing you and will keep doing it until he gets therapy, if he ever chooses to change. let me explain: 

starting off, you are the victim here thats 100% truth from what you wrote but that's all I know to be fair. however, I'm not sure why no one talks about mental health here. but look, here is the ugly truth: he manipulated you into an abusive, co-dependant (please google codependent for ways to prevent you from falling into another) relationship and you let him. You both need therapy but for verryyy different reasons. He needs therapy and or meditation and or medication to notice and stop his abuse (which therapies seem to always be more intensive for the abuser, i mean it makes sense since you mostly are innocent it seems) and you need therapy for learning how to have healthy boundaries so you don't get used and abused just like this again. it's hard to stay out of toxic relationships because the victim usually knows their feelings are valid and understand they weren't the abuser, but you need to get some emotional tools and armor and put it on to protect yourself.

You may have been traumatized in the past like as a child or in past  abusive relationships  that make you feel this was maybe normal at first, then it became an easy and predictable pattern.  I have been there. There isn't anything wrong with you per say, but adjusting how you see yourself like looking at how amazingly you have done for yourself with the knowledge you had at the time and learning how to value yourself more will only help you find better partners. you supported 2 people fully for 10 years! thats amazing! be kind to yourself and gratefulness helps us out of depression. our thoughts matter. it's low self esteem that keeps victims in abusive situations. you are better than how he makes you feel and you are deserving of equality and mutual love. relationships should always be give and take not one person giving all the time and the other taking all the time.


He emotionally abused you and betrayed your trust for 10 years but you also ENABLED him to do so. he may never get better, but you can only do better learning more and more red flag signs and having a firm stand because you putting yourself more as a priority will help you be happier and safer. truth is, pretty much everyone needs therapy to to check in every so often. try not to take things too hard or beat yourself up, you are not alone  and you can get through this ‚ù§Ô∏è

good luck and I hope your next relationship and other future endeavors are more positive and happy for you, but remember, if you don't respect yourself and what you want, no one else will.

edit: u mentioned no appetite. that can be normal in the sympathetic nervous system aka fight ot flight (there are 2 more lessor known ones called fawn and freeze)

The Book ""why does he do that"" by Lundy Bancroft (free copy below) is a great resource for you to learn about the different types of tactics that abusers use and will help you to see if your current relationship is following any of the patterns described.
 If you don't see your relationship being discussed either as one of the architypes or as bits and pieces of any of the other types then you're not worse off by having the knowledge.  If the information does coincide with the way that you're living then there's also a couple chapters on being able to get out safely.
 I wish you the best of luck and I want you to know that you deserve to be with a partner who is going to love you and cherish you and treat you as an equal versus being with someone who's gonna control you be it by how you dress or by finances or by What it is that you can do or who you can see. You deserve so much BETTER we're here rooting for you!

You're apparently married partners, whether properly divorced or not, so there are rights to homes and other such factors to consider legally depending on your local ordinances, but you maintain two options, you can divorce him or you can help him seek help.

You don't have any other decisions you can reasonably make, if you divorce him then it's all gone, tho there may be consequences to a divorce. And if you try to help then it may lead to a long-term recovery which you can set boundaries during, or it may lead to nothing.

But there's really no other option available to you.

No wherein those options does it say you have to keep supporting him. You only ""have"" tod o whatever the law says. All that matters is you decide which one and take steps for that. But going on here and telling us things about someone without context isn't going tos olve anything and will just poison the well.

Further, and probably more importantly, depression can cause things like this. For all we know he's battling in his mind to try to fix these things or make steps but doesn't see a path forward, adn for all we know you're not helping him battle his depression or maybe you are, or maybe you aren't but he's not trying.

Again, we have no context. Words without context are just gossip.

Make the decision. Divorce and that path forward, or put forward the plan of mental health treatment, be it going to a facility, very consistent therapy, psychiatry, etc whatever.

You're just going to keep bemoaning life until you make that decision.

Here's the facts, we don't have enough context. We have one person saying one thing and don't know if they're giving us the big picture, but assuming they're being fully upfront and honest and just happened tof orget to add context, the reality remains there are only two options, divorce and therapy. There are laws preventing actual removal from houses and such legally if someone fights when they're married or partners, and divorce and such are the solutions in those or court orders, which takes time and builds friction and issues.

Therapy takes time too, so that's not going to be an easy fix, to go through with therapy someone has to be diligent and persistent and show high endurance. That may not be something she can take, thus divorce is the option.

Choosing neither will be like acting the issue will just go away if you ignore it.

No one told her to ""play"" therapist. That's the job of psychiatrists and therapists. The reality is she can participate in group therapy expressing her feelings (which is her responsibility given the whole ""in sickness and health"" marriage compact) or she can hope he'll do it on his own, or she can divorce voiding her responsibilities.

It is really that simple.

And no, it's a team work thing tow ork through issues when you marry. Asking someone clearly mentally ill (assumeably) and who's not having success on their won to do it all on their own is not a rational thing for any married couple to say (which is why divorce is her void out of it).

If she was the one having the mental problems its his part to be there for her. In this case she admits to dealing with depression so she should be aware no one person is an army unto themselves.

This sub likes to believe whatever someone says at face value without looking into the context or lack thereof, or looking into the responsibilities of things, and that can not be the solution during mental health issues.

So yes, there's two options, various ways to go about those two options but only two options. Else nothing will change. You likely think divorce is the answer, very well. Until that happens he's gonna be around.

Side note: Going back to work is the least of the issues here, something more major is the mental issue.

Now I am trying to improve my executive function. My mom denies it but almost certainly has BPD also, as she shows all the symptoms they led to my diagnosis. But my therapist says the upside is that, with treatment, the symptoms fade over time for most people. She had doubts is a true cluster b, because of that and because it is a result of trauma.

gmmni1w,t3_lfeg1m,2021-02-08 21:55:50,TwoXChromosomes,"A big part of the problem here is that leave is not built into the existing employment system in the US. Instead of anticipating that sometimes people need to take leave *for a number of reasons* and having systems in place to accommodate leave, the collective response of most American companies is to anticipate nothing and treat any leave as a burden. In the case of new parents, the relatively benevolent HR response is to take unpaid leave under FMLA just to protect one's job, acknowledging that a manager may not like that they have to figure out coverage.

This treatment does not acknowledge that anyone might have to take leave sometime in their career. Yes, not everyone becomes a parent or wants to become a parent, but anyone can get cancer or suffer a condition that requires extended treatment. Anyone can lose a loved one and have to take time to figure out what to do with them and (sometimes) their estate. For individual workers, guaranteeing leave should be seen as both social insurance (in case they need it) and a communal good (to help others as they need it).

Designing a work system that *acknowledged the periodic necessity of leave among employees* is possible. A lot of countries already do it.

* leave would be paid, perhaps by the government
* leave would be guaranteed for reasonable periods of time (6 months or 1 year) based on a qualifying reason
* a temporary worker would be hired or reallocated during that time to cover for the person on leave
* ombuds would clearly communicate policies related to taking leave to employees as well as policies related to covering for absences to supervisors",TaliesinMerlin,t2_xf5n3,17,0,reddit4

People like that have very unrealistic expectations of human behavior and how the consequences of forcing people into giving birth actually hurts all of us at the end of the day. This is especially true of the men who think this way, because on top of all of the ignorance they have about what it means for society to have unwanted children at a higher rate, their ignorance of the direct negative effects of childbirth on non consenting mothers is just another layer of the ignorance cake. Pro-life is a misleading label, and I believe it is best to refer to these people as pro-forced birth. I have family who thinks like this, and so often they will have the nerve to talk about how single mothers are such a big problem because why would you put a child through not having a father or why would you have kids if you can‚Äôt afford them and have to work, etc etc etc. These people either idealize, or are used to the ‚Äúgood ol‚Äô days‚Äù where it was up to a man to decide what his family would look like, and where a man gets to control the finances, and whether a woman works, and so on. It‚Äôs all about controlling women. People like this expect women to submit to their husbands, and now that women don‚Äôt have to, it becomes a legal matter.

The underlying philosophy that guides both of these assertions is **""nobody but yourself should be responsible for the consequences of your choices""**.

* If you have sex and get pregnant, don't push responsibility for your choice onto your child by forcing them to give up their life
* If you need time away from work because you chose to have a child, don't make your coworkers responsible for the consequence of your choice by making them pick up the slack
* Same argument as above for your employer, your neighbours that are paying for your social supports, etc.

If what's bolded above is your foundational assumption about what is right, it makes perfect sense that there should not be maternity leave.

Edit: ah, the classic downvote because you disagree with the worldview, but without commenting to explain why the reasoning is flawed. People complain all the time about ""increasing division"" and the like but refuse to give the benefit of the doubt to those on the other side of the aisle with respect to the fact hat *they are also trying to do the right thing*.

If you really want to have an interesting and useful discussion, understand the fundamental assertion at the root of these belief systems, and then debate that on a philosophical level rather than vilifying people who are also trying to make the world a better place.

I know this comes as a shock to far too many Americans, but people usually don't choose to be poor. They don't decide to work two jobs so that they barely see their kid, they have no choice and barely get enough to get by still.

If an employer chooses to ignore that 50% of the population might spend months of their lives creating another human and doesn't have mechanisms in place in case that happens without putting more pressure on everyone else, who's responsible for that choice? Or who ignores that 100% of people can get sick or have accidents? Where's the responsibility for an employer choosing to ignore reality?

If I decide to take a job that means automatically that it affects someone else who now won't get the job. Basically everything we do affects others on some level and there's nothing we can do about that, so it's just illogical to put the responsibility on the single person who can't change reality.

Everything in life is intertwined. Where's your oh so great philosophy when it comes to us having a good living standard on the backs of children in poorer countries? If that was truly the philosophy of conservatives, they'd be up in arms to make sure that everyone has a decent life where it's actually somewhat up to choices.

Not that that would work then either, because every human is different. People don't decide to be born without arms and legs, people don't decide to have accidents, people don't decide to get sick. Anyone who makes reality the problem of a single person is definitely missing a few marbles.

Parental leave (40 weeks standard or 69 weeks extended) is available to both parents, whether one of them gave birth or they adopted. The leave can be split between both parents, but it doesn't have to be. (Both parents are encouraged to take at least a few weeks off by putting a small cap on how much one parent can claim.)

On top of the parental leave, a person who gives birth can claim up to 15 weeks of maternity leave.

So if I give birth, I could claim my 15-week maternity leave plus 13 weeks of standard parental leave (28 weeks total) and my partner could claim the remaining 27 weeks of parental leave. (I'm not 100% sure if we could each claim a half-week to make it exactly even.)

I didn't comply 100% in the first few months because my rural area had literally one case and no deaths, and businesses weren't enforcing, and the local mask usage was around 10% so it feels awkward.

I'm 60. All I can say is that it IS getting better. Woman by woman, dopey subcontractor by dopey subcontractor. Every single woman who does not fit the stereotype they learned as children. 

Keep at it. It's tedious, but you're not just doing it for yourself - it's for all of us. It's for the next woman, and the one after that.

Your crew are helping, and are on our side.

Every, single, time, that your guys tell them ""She's the boss, get your own coffee"", they are making those subcontractors think about it. Introducing them to the concept. 

Maybe next time, or the 10th time, one of those subcontractors won't assume. And that's good.

I'm retired now, and coordinating renovation/small projects around the house. After 18 months, hubby and I have trained all the local trades people. 

They've learned to call MY phone, not hubby's. They've learned to ask me the questions first if I'm around. If I'm not around, they ask hubby. Sometimes, he'll know the answer, but half the time he'll tell them to go find me. 

I (and my husband) are making these dudes think twice before assuming. These days, I'm getting so much LESS pushback than when I was younger.

I‚Äôve had teachers try and tell me to get out of the driver seat because they thought I was a student. 
I‚Äôve had people see me in a vehicle, and still ask where the driver is.

And if I work with my staff on jobs with multiple vehicles involved, people always make a beeline for the loud ex-policeman they think is in charge, until he points at me and says ‚Äúask her, she‚Äôs the boss‚Äù, which is always met with disbelief. 

There are a fair few people in the industry these days who know me, and have either worked with me on the road, or in my other capacity as a consultant/auditor for the government body that regulates the industry we work in, and they know I know my stuff.

Do any of you young folks realize that when my mom was your age, women weren't allowed in these kinds of jobs? There were a handful, but it was rough for them and they couldn't really talk to other women about their struggle because the majority of women believed they shouldn't be in a place of authority, especially in a blue collar industry. 

By the time I graduated, there were women in these fields, but we were always the minority and only rarely the person in charge. Even so, the idea that women shouldn't work or be in charge of anything was mostly gone, we could turn to other women for support. And those women's groups for specific fields were growing!

There are still clueless men, I don't think that will ever change. But see how much women have changed in only three generations? 


I get a lot of flack for staying home and homeschooling my kids for 20 years, but as a ND person I wasn't cut out for the office. The politics and misogyny wore me down. After a coworker died on a work trip, I realized I didn't want to give the best of me to this company and what's leftover to me kids.  Interestingly, the people on the engineering side were great, the problems were from sales and marketing management and the IT department. (I worked across all three departments.)   

What finally pushed me past the breaking point was when a FRIEND, who was the IT department Director, came to my office, sat in a chair, and proceeded to tell me, ""You'll catch more flies with honey,"" in all seriousness and believing he was going me a favor.

1965 in high school we had to choose electives. Girls were encouraged/pushed into Typing/Office Skills. I, too, did not want to be a secretary so I signed up for Mechanical Drawing instead.

Great class. I learned  to visualize and depict 3D things on 2D paper, how to make a blueprint,etc. I was the only girl in the class and  not surprisingly, had lots of invitations to dances.

I went to college in a curriculum that did a lot of drafting, but by 1969, 2 things had happened. I knew I didn't have the talent for that kind of work and there was this newfangled thing called CAD-CAM which made drafting obsolete. Blue prints lasted longer though.

Flash  forward through some life changes and by the late 70's I was a lawyer. But we had secretaries (doh!) on whom I depended to produce a professional work product. My typing skills remained at ""hunt and peck"". (They are not much better now)

Flash forward again to the early 2010's and I get a job where everybody has to do their own keyboarding/typing and  co-workers are people  whose Word Perfect/Word skills were learned in grade school. My lack thereof had a negative impact on my Review ratings
(sucks!!).

When we talk about choices kids make as a teenager that have a life long impact, it usually focuses on doing drugs or drunk driving or teen-aged pregnancy, but choosing not to take typing falls into that category.

As to OP's issues, I fought that battle circa 1979. Body language, dress, assertive demeanor, the ability to channel a stern 8th grade Catholic school principal, and in her case probably the right color hardhat helps a lot. It also helped to let the sub contractors/other associates etc., hear in advance that the boss in charge of the job/(trial/negotiations/ whatever) is a woman and she takes no shit from anyone.

And now it is at the point where I can comfortably say, ""I am getting up to get some coffee. Does anyone else want some?""

My wife and I (male BTW) have been building our forever home. After talking with home builders and how much everything costs, we ultimately decided our best course forward was for my wife to be the GC on our build as I‚Äôm employed and she isn‚Äôt due to disability. 

She‚Äôs done an amazing job. We‚Äôre almost there. But the sexism is there. Just for a couple examples, we hired a skilled electrician we know to do our house. I remember we had an early in person meeting with him. My wife had taken the lead in planning, I was mostly just there. He still kept focusing on me during the conversation. He would ask me questions and I would just say, you‚Äôll have to ask my wife, she‚Äôs handling this. 

The more chronic issue has been family. My brother in law, who is building next to us, has kept asking me about things that fall in her wheelhouse. And no matter how many times I told him as much, he would keep asking me. Thankfully that has changed recently. 

Same for my dad. I remember one night he asked me about some specifics that I didn‚Äôt know, so I told him to ask my wife. He said that I‚Äôm the man of the house, so I should be responsible for these sort of things. There was a lot of back and fourth, but he seems to have relented.

My husband worked as an Architect for IBM for 42 years. When the kids were little he was gone 2 weeks out of every month. One year, for the whole year, he only came home on weekends. And then there was the time he took a two year contract in Japan. While he was working around the world on consulting jobs I held the fort. 

I hired the contractors for renovations, handymen for the smaller jobs, landscaping and water system companies for the outside work, found a garage I could work with for the car maintenance, and did the research and bought a new car when necessary.

jpbhskn,t1_jpbddpc,2023-06-24 06:04:08,TwoXChromosomes,"I'll ask her this week, but let's see if I can adequately describe the scene.

From the street, the house looks like a normal 1970s single level tract home. What you don't see is that it is built down into a hillside on the backside. 

Upon entering the stained glass front door, you have a formal living room on the left, which has a lovely opening to the formal dining room beyond. Walking further in, the hallway to the right leads to bedrooms, bathrooms, and an office. So, the formal rooms are at the front of the house, as you pass the formal living you walk into the informal living, dining and enormous orange kitchen. 

Turning left, you see a big long wall of wood paneling. It was the 70s, after all. LOL. Except if you push on that 12 foot wall of wood in the right places, doors pop open, revealing an enormous pantry. Think food, small appliances, baking gear, BBQ stuff, linens, big pots, and pans. Everything has a place and is at her fingertips. When all the panels are closed, you would never even know it was there. 

She raised 5 kids in that house, and she put everyone to work preparing meals and preserving food. There is a huge probably 10 feet long and 6 feet wide double height island in the middle of the room. Meaning, all the way around has a normal sized countertop, and in the middle of that, there is another higher countertop running the length. She's a tall woman, and keeps her blender and kitchenaid up there. The side of the island nearest the pantry wall has a commercial kitchen gas burner (for canning) and a single drop in electric burner next to it for serilizing jars and lids and a good sized sink for washing/chopping, peeling fresh fruits and veggies for the canner.
Walking further along the pantry wall, you find the meal planning/cookbook cubby desk, then a doorway to the formal dining room then more counter space with a built in microwave and double ovens and a pass through opening to the dining room with heat lamps installed to keep food warm! 

So, now you are at the side of the house, to the left of the front of the house. Hang a right and along that outside wall is a door to her porch, the fridge, the infamous dishwasher, then a three well bright orange sink and orange laminated countertops, more counter space and a huge bay window looking out towards the mountains. Turn around and there's your big old gas cooktop with copper pots and pans hanging over the vent hood. Continuing down the other side of the island, you have another bright orange sink, a 200 year old solid maple butcher block with an attached old-fashioned meat grinder. Cabinets and open airy space everywhere! 

Somewhere in that kitchen is a dumb waiter, I've seen where it is in the basement food cellar, but I don't know where it comes out in the kitchen. Her idea was to park in the garage down there and use the dumbwaiter to get her groceries up to the kitchen. Pretty slick!

The other thing I love is that her washer and dryer are in the master bathroom! My kitchen window faces her front door across the street. A few weeks after we moved in (years ago), I saw smoke coming from the front of her house. I skedattled across the street to tell them to get out, only for her to tell me it was dryer steam. LOL

We've been great friends ever since.

- Armored hoses (metal braid like the flexible toilet supply lines or an actual armored sheath like AC90 or BX wiring.)
- Running flex hose inside a conduit.
- Running rigid pipe through the cabinets until you're close to the dishwasher and then using a short connector to bridge
- Dropping the plumbing directly downwards like you would in a bathroom

And, in case you really don't want the cabinetry under it to get wet, put a containment tray under the dishwasher with a plumbed in drain.


The exposed length of vulnerable tubing doesn't have to change significantly (and would likely decrease.) 

Our fridge icemaker's water supply pops up right behind the fridge instead of snaking through the cabinetry. Doing the same for a dishwasher hookup seems like a logical extension of the same philosophy.

With them, it could be brutal - sexist comments and rape jokes, whining about having ""so many girls"" on their crew, assuming I couldn't do my job, second-guessing me when I told them things about a venue that I'd been working in for years and they'd only just stepped foot in the for the first time, literally causing me injury by ""helping"" me in a way that made what I was doing unsafe, etc. Our local supervisors were usually quick to shut things down if we complained, but most of the time it was easier to just let it go because we knew they'd be rolling out of town that night/at the end of the week/whatever, and we'd never have to see them again.

I (female) can attest to that. Even around the house, I haven't been able to pick up a hand screwdriver without my SO reminding me of the nursery rhyme, ""Righty tighty, lefty loosey."" Or god forbid I touch a power tool, even though I am an architect and am perfectly competent with power tools.

I'm not proud of this, but in the past these interactions have resulted in, ""Shit!"" ""Fuck!"" ""Then YOU do it!"" Followed by dropping the tool and storming off.

It's the same with driving. Why do men do most of the driving? Women get tired of the judgement by the sexist micromanager in the passenger's seat, and just give up after a while. It's easier to just let the man \[drive / do the dirty work / do the fun technical stuff / be handy / rule the blue-collar world / etc.\] if he is just going to hover and bully you whenever you try to do it.

I personally know women in blue-collar jobs who are hardly able to get anything done thanks to unrelenting interruptions from ""helpful"" men. They are not even given a chance to do the most basic parts of their job, let alone the actually rewarding parts. And then we women are supposed to think of men as gods for doing the jobs they crowded us out of.

I've had enough horrible experiences with contractors, electricians, plumbers, and HVAC guys to know to just leave the house and have my SO take care of it. They aren't going to be making eye contact with me anyway, so I might as well save my rage. We had our windows replaced last year when the guy doing the sale asked a (somewhat) technical question. I answered it three times in a row while he pretended I wasn't even there. Finally, my SO repeated exactly what I had said, and the sale was on. Typical.",,,5,0,reddit2

My ex was one of those guys. We used to fight about it. He‚Äôd be like, I don‚Äôt want to be getting my ass kicked and the first person running in is a short, skinny woman. And ask him would you rather me running in, where I would actually attempt to help and cuff, etc, or would you rather M show up, just so he could stand to the side and watch and point to where you‚Äôre getting your ass kicked, if he shows up at all? 

There were plenty of us ladies there who were able and willing to jump in and do our jobs, just like there were quite a few men who when a code would go off in front of them, would stand and watch and direct the responders on where their partner was getting their ass kicked. It had nothing to do with sex, it has to do with being scared. It is scary‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs your job. Never met another lady on that job who was too scared to jump into a fight, etc. We never got enough credit, and any credit given was often given with a ‚Äúyeah, she did good, but *I* would‚Äôve done XYZ.‚Äù It was always tempered with a but. 

Plus, a lot of us women, myself included, just knew how to talk to people. There were plenty of times shit was getting heated on the block or the yard, and I‚Äôd step in, say something stupid the get both inmates to look at me like WTF, and then separate them to talk. Even if they didn‚Äôt want to talk, I could get them to at least leave each other alone. It didn‚Äôt always work, especially when what was going on was bigger than personal beef, but it worked a lot of the time. And it might sound sexist on the inmates‚Äô parts, but I know a lot of them would see me come in in the am and I knew shit was supposed to be going down, or things were hot on the block and they‚Äôd decide we‚Äôre not doing this with a woman here.

It's the risk of sexual assault / rape from male co-workers.

Should women who want to work in blue collar physical jobs apply for CCW (Concealed Carry Weapons) permit?  That would seem like a good reason to CC just because there is a higher risk and threat of sexual assault.  

The other weird thing is that I'm almost sure that the males on the job site would (as a group) engage in cat-calls and social behavior that is threatening and often escalates to rape and physical assault.  

I think Concealed Carry and women's firearm training would definitely be strongly advised... as a precaution and preparation if and when it gets to an on the job rape situation.  

On a related note, in rural red states with little to no gun control, a lot of women conceal carry.  This is because of the rural honor culture in those rural regions, high rates of (unreported) rape and misogyny.  

I would be curious to see the statistics or rape and rape-related justified self defense killings involving a firearm in red states.  I bet that there are higher rates of rape and justified self defense killings (by women) in red states.  Just my 2c.  

I do think that the rates of sexual assault would decrease if women had firearms training and prepared for assault by having a CC weapon.  

I'm also in favor of increased news coverage of instances of women stopping a sexual assault by using firearms.  I think that news coverage of these incidents would definitely act as a deterrent to sexual assault and decrease cultural misogyny.",the_fly_guy_says_hi,t2_6z1i75h5,1,0,reddit2

In the eighties and nineties anyone who mentioned a safety hazard was generally ridiculed and (big surprise) feminized. ""Stop acting like a little girl"", etc. Nowadays many, if not most companies take safety seriously, and it's not uncommon to have a coworker call you out on unsafe practices. There are still plenty of companies that have the old ""OSHA is bullshit"" cultures, and prioritize production over safety, but smart craftspeople don't work for them, and they tend to be fly-by-night companies.

It sucks that most building trades are still pretty exclusionary to women, but I think that's starting to change as well. I've seen a few women in the trades in the past ten years (mostly welders and sparkies, fwiw), whereas that was almost unheard of thirty years ago. Don't give up, y'all.

I work in IT,  which is already make dominated, but I work in an even more male niche of it. I've been the only woman on any of my teams for over a decade. Even before that, there was only one other and she really wasn't competent. Everyone sees me as ""one of the guys"" rather than a woman. 

I take that back. I met my husband on one of those teams, but even then he saw me as one of the guys for years. 

I admit I tend to behave, and often dress, following masculine gender stereotypes, but I am quite clearly afab. 

I generally don't mind. I fit in well in this niche and enjoy it, but it's sometimes a bit irritating that fitting in means being seen as another man more than a woman. I don't act how I do to seem more masculine. It's just who I've always been. That's probably how I ended up in a field like this, though. I've been more accepted and taken less discrimination from the men because of it. 

The even rougher side is that other women in other areas of IT also see me that way because of the niche I'm in. They don't see me as a woman in IT. I've even been told that by some of them. I've been told I should dress and act more feminine because I'm just falling for the patriarchy, and I'm play acting for the approval of the men. This absolutely pisses me off. I love my job. I like how I dress. I am very happy with who I am. And I'm much more upset when a woman is trying to enforce social norms of gender on me in order for me to be considered a woman. To them, even, the default in my job is man, so I'm more one of those than a woman, and that's bullshit.

ilwm13g,t1_ilwhsdd,2022-08-26 18:55:21,TwoXChromosomes,"I'm rather happy with my ""new"" job I started in March. The only sexism has been literally one guy who won't cuss around me because I'm a woman. That's it. I'm not even sure I know how to handle this environment, but I have to tell you, my stress levels have plummeted. My last job was toxic in other ways, but sexism played into probably 80% of my stress there. No job is perfect, but the things that do come up are so much easier to handle without the fact that I don't have a penis constantly being a factor. 

Things off the top of my head: 

They hired me because I'm assertive and encourage that. 

They listen when I speak and believe what I say.

They trust me to be competent and don't second guess me. 

Men don't win automatically in differing opinions except when it's obviously about seniority and knowing the product better. 

Zero mansplaining. I'm new enough there's a lot of explaining happening, but it never happens unless I ask or they are tasked with teaching me something. 

The only differences in the way they treat me and my male team member who started 2 weeks before me is that they explain things in greater detail to him because he needs that and they tend to be more social with me because I am more social with them. 

No one has expressed doubt when I've mentioned a previous physical labor job I had, like roofing. 

Except the one guy reluctant to cuss around me, there's no discomfort that I'm there. And he's clearly being polite, not worried I'll be offended. Jokes in meetings happen freely and often. None of them are gender based, and there are no awkward moments where you can tell someone re-thought something just before they said it. No one worries ""the woman will get offended"" because they're just not offensive. That's sooooo freaking refreshing. 

We mostly avoid the topic of politics, but it came up once because the CEO put me on edge in an all hands meeting
 A woman was obviously not in her home office when she joined, he asked where she was, she declined to answer. He pushed it. She was at an anti-abortion law protest. He was like ""oooh, yeah. Let's leave that to the women ..."" and then he and others joked about it  That bothered me, and I made a comment in our team's slack channel. I was encouraged to call him out and ended up speaking to him privately. He started the next week's all hands with a proper apology with an admission of the error, accepting culpability, and a plan to learn better and not do that kind of thing. It wasn't ""I'm sorry I upset people."" It was ""I did this. It was wrong, and I now understand why. I plan to do x things to learn more and change how I think.""

ilug3hn,t1_ilu4owe,2022-08-26 08:30:25,TwoXChromosomes,"Ooooh. The money makes more sense then. 

One of my boys looked nice and fluffy when I adopted him, if really dirty, but I knew there would be issues. He belonged to an elderly couple who couldn't even take care of themselves. He was reactive to brushing, so they only did it twice a year - in a very traumatic way. He'd never had a bath before. He was underweight, out of shape, but still so friendly with me and the dog I already had. 

Yep, under the outer fluff was years of mats, burrs, and even twigs. His tail was so bad, it felt like the bones were actually deformed. He had hot spots they had just been spraying with something bitter instead of addressing why he was chewing on himself. His fur was so sunburnt, he was pure white after the first bath, and that bath took so many treats he ended up throwing up after, poor guy. 

I didn't want him shaved, so I did a lot of the work myself, but once I had him to the point he hated being brushed but wouldn't outright attack over it, I took him in for a full grooming. Turns out that ""won't attack"" was only for me, but I made sure they knew his history and behavior first. Nine groomers turned us down before we found this place. They're amazing with him and worth even more than I pay them, but they refuse to let me tip more than 100%. 

He only goes about twice a year. I handle it otherwise, but I can't trim his dewclaws without him trying to maul me and us getting into a mutual anxiety feedback loop. I have them do a full grooming that includes nails, teeth, and shaving in between his toes. They're worth more than they'll let me pay, honestly.

But the poor animals suffer for it.

I couldn't handle seeing so many animals day in and day out that were treated like that. I only had the shop for 2 years. Cost me a pretty penny to get out of the lease, too.

I had tons that came in with such bad flea infestations that when I ran the water over them it came out red from rehydrating the flea dirt. Those dogs were anemic from an infestation that bad. I'd tell the people - and OMD - excuse, after excuse,  after excuse. It was sickening.

But you are an incredible person for taking on such a challenge. I hear stories like yours and it gives me hope. 

I'm so glad your boy was able to find you so you could show him the good side of people. I'm glad you didn't give up looking for a compassionate groomer. 9 tries is a lot, and I'll bet that took a lot out of you both.
Believe it or not finding a patient groomer is hard. And it's not their fault; they get paid too little, and are treated so badly; by both the public, and their bosses - it's a wonder they stay in the profession at all.

One thing I used to so was groom shelter dogs to pretty them up so they might get adopted quicker - and yes  - that did the trick, and they got adopted right afterward.

They finally listed him for adoption via a local snow dog rescue because they had to move in with their daughter, son in law, and grandkids who had cats. Gus is very much not safe with cats, so he was banished to the yard - at least that was huge. But still, the day I went to see him, it was over 100F and he'd been outside for days. He actually likes the heat, but I don't let him stay in it for too long. No matter how well they could or couldn't take care of him, they did love him. He didn't years as basically a lap dog, and suddenly he was a full time outdoor dog. It broke my heart. I changed plans on letting the dogs get to know each other over several visits and took him home immediately. 

I used to foster dogs with behavioral issues and train them so they could be adopted. Gus wasn't as bad physically as most of them, and his behavior is much, much better than any of them were to start. It wasn't so much to take on.

Yeah, that breeder was bad news. Sucks there's so many like that.

My shop was in California  - the fleas (and ticks) are pretty bad there. I used to have a jar in the shop with alcohol that I put the ticks in, as I didn't trust anything else would kill them. Without squishing them - they're hard to kill. That jar got filled up in 2 years. I heard stories from veterinarians how they'd get dogs that required medical intervention from being so anemic after having infestations for so long. It was like they had been shot, and had lost too much blood!

Anyway, yeah  - at least those people knew they needed the help with your dog.

Also, it's hard to imagine dogs in even worse shape than yours. That IS heartbreaking. 

I got a Pit Bull off the street one time. Where I lived in CA was semi-rural, and people were dumping animals out there on the regular. I guess I took in around 25 animals in the 16 years I lived there.

Anyway, this poor Pitty had his tail broken in two places, and there were open wounds all over his body. The poor thing.  It was clear somebody was fighting him.
Well, I got him home and he right away wanted to kill my dogs. I never had turned a dog over to Animal Control before this. I would always take them in, rehabilitate them, and either rehome them, or keep them myself. Well - this guy - I couldn't do either. I had no choice but to call Animal Control. They euthanized him right away. That was really tough for me.

Again, this was in the 90s, and today I think if I had more skills maybe I could have prevented that from happening. I mean - when they got all the dogs off of Michael Vick's property they were able to rehabilitate almost all of them. So, knowing that made the realization of what I did even harder.

Because they are treating people unfairly. 

>They have a duty to their shareholder/owners/stakeholders to get as much as possible for as little as possible.

No. Publicly traded companies have a duty to act in the financial best interest of shareholders. That doesn't require them to treat workers unfairly. In fact, for companies operating in countries with labor laws that require equitable pay, those companies are accepting a legal and financial risk by refusing to comply.

Also, lots of organizations aren't publicly traded corporations. There are employers that are governments, nonprofit organizations, etc.

Moreover, while your thinking worked great in 19th century labor markets, wherein people had fewer rights, less ability to move from job to job, and a host of other factors, it doesn't hold true for an educated and transient technology workforce highlighted in OP's post. Unironically, we are currently responding to a post, which is ostensibly intended to inform systematically underpaid workers of their situation, so as to improve it.

Competently managed organizations don't view workers as a cost in the same sense that a machine is a cost. That's a recipe for high turnover and low engagement, both of which increase costs. It also creates a negative reputation among prospective workers, which makes the employer less competitive in the labor market. Screwing your workers is false economy.",Harry-le-Roy,t2_16fv33,2,0,reddit3

Ironically, you're actually *defending* that practice without understanding it. Counteracting gender bias in pay is not handing something to a person without effort on their part. It's mitigating an unfair practice that pays them *less* for similar work for no legitimate reason. Paying men *more* through a biased practice is just that- handing them something ""on a plate with no effort from them just because.... "" they are men.

If someone keeps robbing your home and the police finally put a stop to that, you're not somehow receiving a handout from the universe equal to the value of the goods that would have been stolen had the crime continued.

No. If they have similar qualifications, similar positions, and similar duties, but significantly different pay, that's unfair. In some countries, it happens to also be illegal if those unfair pay disparities are related to factors like gender, race, disability, sexual orientation, national origin, etc. What factors and what conditions depend on what laws are applicable. The reason those laws exist is because of longstanding widespread patterns of targeting women, minorities, and persons associated with other out-groups for lower pay and less opportunity.

People seldom, if ever have identical qualifications. That's why I keep using phrases like ""similar qualifications"". However, in aggregate, we wouldn't expect to see statistically significant differences in pay among people with similar qualifications and jobs, and especially who have similar objective measures of performance. However, this happens, and when it happens on the basis of gender and race, it's unfair, and in some countries it's illegal. 

> Just having the same job title does not mean you should get the same pay.

I've never claimed otherwise. I said ""similar qualifications,"" ""similar positions,"" and ""similar duties"". Having the same job title doesn't imply any of these things. If you'd like to argue a point I've actually made, feel free.

>If women do not have the confidence to value themselves highly they probably also do not have the confidence to stick their neck out to make decisions.

Let's revisit this. Women evidently have the confidence to get a law through Congress to help ensure equitable pay. So, if you sincerely believe this:

...then why are you complaining that women have availed themselves of a law to help them? Do you feel that that's unfair?

You've asserted that your ""confidence"" and ""courage"" are good things, and that people who are different from you in this respect are somehow lacking. Yet, you've been confident in yourself throughout this entire discussion- and wrong, over and over and over. In fact, despite beginning with factual errors, exhibiting no evidence of education or experience in management, no knowledge of the topic, and offering arguments that lack even internal logical consistency, you remain confident that somehow you're right. You're not, and despite being confronted with clear evidence of that, you continue to defend your own mistakes. 

This isn't confidence. It's hubris. It's being oblivious, and worse, asserting that you know something about a topic that clearly you don't. Your arguments suggest that don't know the first thing about this subject, and yet you jumped into an argument about it, rather than informing yourself. 

Throughout my career, I've seen lots of knowledge workers in fields like IT, engineering, applied sciences, finance, and others, who feel really smart early in their careers. Some of them wind up believing on some level that they know everything. None of them ever have actually known everything, because in the grand scheme of things, nobody knows very much. These guys are abrasive, but on balance, useful to the organization- at first. Eventually, people see through it, grow tired of the antisocial behavior, and realize that vaguely similar technical skills can be had for less money from a younger worker. I've seen multiple people with great technical skills fired because they think like you do. I've also had the experience several times that a former coworker found me on LinkedIn or called me out of the blue with a similar story: They're an over-middle-aged knowledge worker, who no longer looks part of a smart, young guy, who makes a bit too much money, and has been downsized. What they often don't realize is that people are tired of their condescension and their presumption that they know things thst clearly they don't. And now they're reaching out to me for a job.

So, now that I've assumed the role of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, at last I offer advice. You don't know what you don't know, and you would benefit from recognizing when you've crossed into a subject you don't understand, or even an individual question you don't know the answer to. Second, hesitancy isn't inherently bad. In particular, you would benefit from some healthy self-reflection and questioning why you think you know something. That's likely to prevent mistakes. 

One particular topic that you don't seem to understand is the experience of women. It's different from yours, and you don't get it. Listen to women, and ask them questions with civility. Also recognize that what you're perceiving as indecision may simply be healthy skepticism. Moreover, most cultures raise girls and women to cultivate their social and emotional intelligence. Women are more likely to perceive that you're angry, and that you're going to get angrier when it becomes clear to everyone that you're wrong. I suspect that based on your posture and arguments on this sub, you're probably impolite, dismissive, and condescending to women in your professional and personal life. In some cases, you're perceiving women's exhaustion at this treatment as lacking confidence. In others, they're confident, and you're just not listening to them, because they're women. That's not women's to solve, that's yours to solve.

So, do with this what you will. It's sound advice, and you can learn something from it. Good luck.",Harry-le-Roy,t2_16fv33,1,0,reddit3

I'm in school right now, majoring in a male-dominated field, and you could easily guess that the majority of my peers and professors are male.  But when I have had the chance to work with the two female faculty in my major, I've always felt incredibly inspired.  I honestly doubt I would have even switched my major had it not been for these two women who are extremely passionate about what they do.

Thank you to you and other women who do the same.  Having other women to mentor you in a male-dominated field can really change your entire life.  If I had picked another major I would have absolutely regretted it later on--that's why I'm eternally grateful for such amazing female mentors.

Based on the current state of society, yes in indeed it would be normal to say ‚Äúhuh, that‚Äôs weird‚Äù if tomorrow every single Supreme Court justice we‚Äôre female. However, the point isn‚Äôt about how people react now, it‚Äôs about how people will react to that same situation 10, 20, 50, or a hundred years from now. Societal perceptions change, and what would cause a ‚Äúhuh‚Äù reaction will also change. Some day in the future, an all-female Court may be the most normal thing in the world, just as an all-male Court would be, and that‚Äôs when we know that society has reached a point when men and women are really considered equal.

dyjoeqj,t1_dyixtll,2018-05-06 18:19:01,TwoXChromosomes,It's pretty brutal.  First year pay used to be about $25k USD or less for a regional first officer.  That's after dropping 6 figures on training and a few years flight instructing or some other entry level job.  Not to mention you're going to be spending most of your time on the road away from home.  Your job or base can disappear with little to no warning and the actuarial tables say you're probably going to die early.

I think that it‚Äôs more useful to think about what would have needed to change in society to make those kinds of perceptual changes possible. If this is how we end up thinking about the Supreme Court, then we probably think the same about CEOs, police officers, and all sorts of other things too. The real requirement of equality isn‚Äôt specifically around the Supreme Court, it‚Äôs changes that our society must have undergone to make an all-female (insert any entity here) seem the most normal thing in the world.

RBGs original comment was specific to the Supreme Court because she is on it,  and because it was in an interview about gender relations within the Supreme Court.

The thing is I work in aviation already, for a major (foreign) airline via a subcontractor (subcontractor because budget), and they're cutting hours on top of having no flight benefits, no full time hours, etc. People actually employed by the airline (of which there are less than a dozen, discounting mechanics) have to multitask - supervisor, sales/ticketing, ground operation - because of budgeting.

So that is just a really bad mentality and worldview to have about equality. I don't know how you don't see that. I feel like the nurse analogy may help but apparently not. You just need to surrender your conception of what constitutes equality to reality. Equality is not the same as equity. It would be a BAD thing for society to accept all female (insert anything) as normal. An all female military, police force, firefighting force, etc is just biological not normal. You need to accept that because it is the reality you live in. Your standards will never be met if they are absurd. And then you will fail to create a just society.
