The comments in the original post are insane.
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve been working 18 days straight, then so has she‚Äù is ridiculously insulting. Even if he was some kind of meditation guru or not doing physical labor, he is still working and providing for the family.
When did society begin to believe that staying home and playing in the yard with the kids and eating donuts is an equal contribution to actually making money? People often say that being a SAHM is a full-time job. If that's the case, than maybe they should ‚Äòwork‚Äô a little harder. Making sure people are fed is among the most important duty a SAHM has. Imagine if OP continually failed to do the bare minimum at work. He would be fired! You can't say it's a job and then not act like it.
I have so many problems with the mother‚Äôs actions. Firstly, OP says that she's a ‚Äúfantastic mom,‚Äù however I'm not sure that allowing 2 kids to eat 10 droughts (it's also possible that they ate all 12 and she just drank the coffee) at 3:30 is going to win her mother of the year.
Secondly, OP is the one who PAID for the droughts and paid for all the food in the house that should've been used for dinner. She bought food with his money and then proceeded not to leave him any. I find this to be insulting in itself. 12 donuts and you can't save one for dad? 
Third, she left trash on the table. That alone isn't acceptable. Is he supposed to come home after a long and demanding shift AND THEN clean up after her? 
Many commenters apparently can‚Äôt read and insist that he packs a lunch even though he says that he wouldn't even have time to eat it. Even if OP did have time to eat lunch, he shouldn't be the one making it. The person who goes to the grocery store is the one who needs to make lunch, otherwise, neither partner has any idea what food is in the kitchen.  
Commenters are also saying that if he wants to have dinner ready when he comes home, he should pay for daycare. It's clear to me that his wife still wouldn't have food ready for him, but that's not the main problem with this idea. OP would be paying for daycare so that his wife would do NOTHING all day. If his wife began working 50 hours/week then daycare would be great. You can't be a SAHM if your kids are in daycare... That's called being a burden. 
It's also worth pointing out that OP is hourly, if he was salaried he wouldn't work 18 days straight and not have any breaks. I'm not sure what his benefits package is, but I would imagine it isn't exceptional. Full retirement matching, high-quality health insurance, etc. are all things that OP likely doesn't have. OP won't be able to do this job until his retirement. When he becomes physically unable to do intensive labor, will his wife begin to work too? I bet she will take half, tell the kids not to talk to him anymore, and get the court to award her some of his social security benefits.  That she walked out of the house with the kids is evidence enough.",FedUM,t2_9gdebv7sw,3,0,reddit2

In the cache, one could see links to the initial comment, and to a few of his replies in the discussion that followed.

Yes, we are. When I went to where his profile (u/Negative\_Benefit1756) would have been, one is greeted with the words

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>""This account has been suspended .""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

on the usual nearly blank screen. Go there, and you can see that for yourself.

[https://www.reddit.com/user/Negative\_Benefit1756](https://www.reddit.com/user/Negative_Benefit1756)

&#x200B;

Just to be safe, I'm archiving that suspension announcement in both [the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20230703132152/https://www.reddit.com/user/Negative_Benefit1756) and [Archive Today](https://archive.is/kIKVO), so if that Reddit reverses itself, later, and somebody should try to pretend that the suspension never took place, I'll be able to prove otherwise.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>""Okay, well that is just insane and unhinged if he was penalized in any way.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was (and remains) , as you say, ""insane and unhinged,"" but there's no ""if"" about it. The word ""suspended"" is right there. If the mods will allow, I can show you archived copies of the Google cache of his profile. As you will be able to see for yourself, he encountered his first act of censorship when his account was less than an hour old, and said account was suspended less than a day before he set it up.

Not a lot of mysteries with this case. The man's account didn't survive long enough for there to be any, really.

&#x200B;

**Note to the mods:** I read your rules, and I know that you're worried about brigading, but in this case, there is no danger of that. The mods of AITA have locked the only discussion that the now suspended user in question took part in. A user from this sub, on arrival there, couldn't take part in it, even if he wanted to.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>Why on earth would he be removed for that?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Because the admins are insane and unhinged? People aren't always reasonable.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>Is swearing against the rules?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

No, not the rules of the sub (archived [here](https://archive.is/j899E) and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230703124827/https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/)), nor [the content policy for Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy), which I've also archived in both of the major archives ( [1](https://archive.is/eP7fA) |[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20230703124744/https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) ).

Restructuring, they say... to protect themselves legally. Restructuring indeed. In the time I was at my last company, of ~100 hires there were ~5 white males. MANY MANY more left or were shown the door. 

The corporate world is no longer a place for masculinity, assertiveness and being willing to stand alone. It's about conformity, keeping your head down and building alliances/backstabbing. I don't know that it ever was, it's probably always been a hive of betas which has now been invaded and taken over due to their inherent weakness.

So... applying for new jobs, it's open sexism and racial discrimination as others have mentioned.

While you may find more women and minorities on the hiring panels, that doesn't mean you're discriminated against. Women are notorious for not hiring other women and many minorities groups are the same with their ""own people"". What you're seeing is just a tighter labor market, especially for certain tech companies. As good as your resume is, you likely weren't even the best person from your company who was let go and that's who you're competing with. Some companies have also gotten overly selective thinking a better candidate is around the corner. I've also read some hiring managers from non-tech companies say they're reluctant to hire people from big tech. They often want to interview them and learn some secret sauce but they fear they'll leave soon if hired. 

To be completely honest, many people in tech are struggling right now to find work. I've spoken to devs with 10+ years talking about 300+ applications with no interviews.

The part that always bothered me is that we‚Äôve been here as long as any other racial group (SEAs were at Jamestown), we were blown up in train tunnels, prevented from even immigrating to the US for 50 years, went through segregation (in the south, we had to sit in the back of the bus too), put in literal American concentration camps, ridiculed in media, hurt and killed during covid, etc.

This is aside from experiencing Asian family dynamics, which are often built upon gaslighting and physical abuse.

But then, those white liberals who are in charge tell us that we‚Äôre ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù and ‚Äúwhite-adjacent,‚Äù and white conservatives tell us that we‚Äôre a ‚Äúmodel minority‚Äù and ‚Äúgood workers‚Äù while openly mocking Asian accents on the campaign trail.

They basically succeeded their way into failure.

Asians in American have gone a similar route.  Bluntly put, you'd reached the point of being ""white""- at least for social and economic purposes- and that threatened the hucksters whose meal ticket depended on a massive bulwark of racism dominating the cultural zeitgeist, so things were twisted until being seen as white became a bad thing.

My great-grandparents, who came here from Ireland back before the Irish, too, became white, lasted into my teenage years- and you know those ""no Irish need apply"" signs that so many people nowadays want to pretend didn't exist?

You can imagine how much fun it is to be denied jobs simply because your ancestors actually struggled to be accepted and lead the damn labor movement that created the weekend- or you COULD, if not for the fact that you don't really have to, do you?

One that I use it for is when I have to write a paper or article or report, I can jot down some major and minor bullet points and throw it into ChatGPT to write up a draft.

kgco27j,t1_kgckjmh,2024-01-04 23:14:21,science,"What do you mean my statement about ChatGPT is wrong?  Sure it is auto-regressive, but it doesn't actively retrain itself during every single session.  ChatGPT does not implement real-time active learning.  Even in a deterministic world a free agent actively integrates new information to come to a understanding of the world an make decisions, ChatGPT doesn't.  It doesn't matter whether or not you are a compatibilist.

>  What do you think Machine learning models are?

Depends on the model.  Generally they are a lump of stats and linear algebra thrown at data, but machine-learning itself is poorly defined.  One could call linear-regression a ""machine-learning"" algorithm.  If you are talking about neural networks specifically they are finite implementations of universal function approximators.

You seem to be under some impression that I was making some grand statement regarding the philosophy of free will that was getting under your skin.  I'm not.  I was talking about the specifics of the implementations of certain products and algorithms.

ChatGPT has no more ""free will"" than a program that computes the average of a set of numbers.  If you are going to take a Turing approach to ""can machines think"" instead and go with ""if it looks like a duck"", well then you either have to accept that it is subjective and you have no right to claim I am wrong one way or another, or you can read his paper and realize he was being flippant because the question is ambiguous and was tired of being asked about it.",Rodot,t2_5qfnf,8,0,reddit4

She told us flat out that it is a washout class and strongly urged us to drop it for our own sake. Of course by then it was well past the point to pick up another class so I rode it out.

We are finding more and more native civilizations that look like they are city-states. With tons of trade routes and acting as if they were similar to European, larger cities during the medieval ages. And then for some reason they broke apart (?), Not really sure what to call it. However, they went from those style cities back to what we normally get taught in high school. They went back to tribal based culture. Including moving around and migrating around which was proven and is constantly proven to help the ecosystems that they stayed in for a little while. They would leave and migrate around. And by doing so allow the ecosystem to grow back properly. We even know that they catered the forests with underbrush cleaning and everything to keep wildfires down and because they were doing that for so long, there are only certain seeds that germinate from fire.

The locals including children were forced into the sex trade to payback debts. Cargill chair the roundtable on sustainable palm production. Palm is a staple product in most industrial foods including plant based foods. You can find examples of this with jamaican bananas, Ukrainian and central African grain, South American and coffee. Its horrible. The wolf is guarding thr hen house yet they produce vegan products. 

Child labor is a negative aspect of our food system like land use issues, there isn't one single issue related to food. You have to consider who grows the food and how, how trade and politics impacts the growers, whether you're supporting an agro regime or small farm. Sustainability issues within the food system are vast. You should look into food sovereignty. 

Veganism isn't automatically sustainable. If you're consuming majority tropical products, cash crops and industrial foods you are consuming sustainably, you're not consuming animal (for good reason). The choices you made are more important than the label.",,,1,0,reddit1

Good god, Canada has a huge problem just trying to recruit new nurses, people are looking at the shambles of provincial healthcare where multiple provinces are slowly trying to privatize everything and saying they'd rather work in almost any other job where they won't be pushed to the breaking point so some corporate executive can buy another mansion. 


In Ontario, hospitals have to rely more and more on private, for-profit nurse staffing agencies because the province can't reatain nurses directly. They are giving up provincial benefits to go to a job that pays slightly better, has slightly better scheduling practices. 
That company in turn charges the province over four times more than it cost to employ the nurses directly. 

One prominent owner of these temp agencies is a former provincial premiere who laid the groundwork for his future career of milking taxpayer money. He and his wife own at least two nurse staffing agencies, and he's the chairman of the board of the biggest private long term care corporation in the province, which is also hugely profitable thanks to rules he implemented when he was premiere.

1.

Let hospitals be built if people think there's enough demand for another one to make it work. End local Healthcare monopolies.


2. Stop regulating the number of students allowed to enroll in medical school. Look, I know the high demand for doctors keep their income very high and medical school very expensive because the demand for both greatly exceeds the forcefully limited supply, but we past the point of diminishing returns 20 years ago.


3. Get rid of the excessive regulations that make it so doctors frequently spend more time on paperwork than on patients. Sometimes the doctor themselves isn't doing the paperwork other than signing it, but then they have to work longer to afford to pay the staff and that also leads to burnout.

Let hospitals be built if people think there's enough demand for another one to make it work. End local Healthcare monopolies.""

Where do you see authorities preventing the construction of new hospitals? It certainly isn't occurring in Texas. The problems we face are staffing the hospitals (and other heathcare facilities) we have and providing enough funding to keep rural hospitals open.


""2. Stop regulating the number of students allowed to enroll in medical school. Look, I know the high demand for doctors keep their income very high and medical school very expensive because the demand for both greatly exceeds the forcefully limited supply, but we past the point of diminishing returns 20 years ago.""

The primary ""regulation"" for the number of nursing and physician students is the availability of clinical training slots, and the greatest clamp on those slots is the lack of qualified supervisors. Schools aren't turning away students for whom they have the capacity to train.


""3. Get rid of the excessive regulations that make it so doctors frequently spend more time on paperwork than on patients. Sometimes the doctor themselves isn't doing the paperwork other than signing it, but then they have to work longer to afford to pay the staff and that also leads to burnout.

""Do that, and you solve 75% of the problems with the U.S. Healthcare System.""

The greatest source of ""regulatory paperwork"" that physicians and other healthcare professionals face is the maze created by our bizarre grafting of a risk-insurance model of funding onto health care. So, yes, getting rid of that and moving to a system primarily funded through a single-payer model providing basic healthcare coverage for every US resident would go a long way toward solving that problem.",UnionTed,t2_1tga1w4l,8,0,reddit2

jrml33e,t1_jrmhzda,2023-07-12 03:55:59,science,"I know that's what you're told, however, insurance companies used to be very simple risk models, basing prices on the risk being asked for the company to assume, and weren't all so onerous to work with. Know what changed that? The actions of that single payer, that's what! Instead of just risk models, now they were forced to take high risks, and were forced not to be able to charge the required amount for that risk by government regulations. For example, insurance companies used to have cheap policies specifically for children as the health risk a child represents is very small and if you get the policy early, then more often than not, by the time anything major happened, the parents had already paid more in premiums than the cost of paying out for whatever was needed, and it worked. Then the government felt it was wrong to not insure older children whose parents did not pay into the policy, driving the rate so far up that the policies were then cancelled and children were enrolled under the same policies as the adults, so where there used to be a very cost effective way to insure a child, now there wasn't. That's one example of dozens. If you think the government won't mess up healthcare once it has complete control over it, think again.

A friend of mine lives in Canada with such a system. His son got a splinter embedded deep into his thumb, too deep to safely dig out, so his parents took him to the hospital in Canada. They said they could see him in 6 weeks. The next morning his son's thumb was so infected they were afraid that he might loose it, or that it might spread further. They went back to the hospital, they said they could put him on a waiting list if they wanted to wait close by in case something opened up sooner but if not, he could be seen in 2 weeks, by which time the infection would probably have spread past the point of saving. So, they came to stay with me for a week and took their son to the hospital here, they made him wait 10 hours, which is still absurd, but at the end, he had antibiotics and a gameplan on how to treat his thumb. A week later, he was totally healed up.

A free market healthcare system isn't perfect, and the government's done nothing but make it increasingly difficult to do anything, but if you think giving that same government complete control is the answer, well, there are several other countries that do that, move there and enjoy! Here, we need to get the government almost completely out of healthcare like it used to be. My doctor knows better than a bureaucrat that lives 3,000 miles from me ever will.

Lasik eye surgery is largely unregulated by the government and also not covered by most insurance companies. Over the past 20 years, the price has dropped precipitously and the results have gotten better and better. What used to cost $40,000 now costs $2,000 or less and has even better results and very little waiting. That's what a free-market system can do. Plus, in a free-market system, if my kid gets very very sick where his life is in danger, I can pay for whatever treatment might help, and try again, and again, until I can't afford anymore. In a single-payer system, a guy in a chair with a gavel decides how much my son's life is worth and when I have to stop, and with no other nations having a free-market healthcare system, I won't have anywhere else to go like many residents of the U.K. and Canada that come here for help can.",Daramore,t2_x08vj,0,0,reddit2

Maximizing profits? Or minimizing losses
 They're exactly the same thing. Every single emergency department in the entire country loses money like crazy and needs the rest of the hospital to make up for it. 

That's not something they want to or can afford to lose even more money doing.

Good, then you should know the answer to this question. Which healthcare system has come up with more life saving medical treatments, technologies, and innovations? Market driven systems, or single payer systems?

I'm sure you know the answer, but the real question is how much. The answer is that in the last century, over 98% of modern medicine originated in market based healthcare systems. This enabled us to take life expectancy and significantly increase it! Most of that innovation came from the U.S. and still does today.

You also know with your vast experience that healthcare in this nation has been declining in various ways over the past 40 years, thus why you want to move to a single payer system, and in fact the most complaints about our healthcare system have taken place in the last 10 years. Know what changed? There was a huge package of government regulations that rolled out, and more and more since. That isn't the only change of course, but it is the largest by far. Not only that, but these regulations killed a lot of the competition when it comes to insurance companies so that there are really only 3 that compete on any significant level now where there used to be hundreds. Also, good luck starting another one and complying with all the regulations. The insurance giants don't mind the pressure too much because it leaves them uncontested, and thus all the things you have against insurance companies.

I just don't see how the solution to all these issues that are a direct result of government seizing more and more control over the market is to give that same government total control of it.

Do you really think politicians and bureaucrats can really make better decisions for you and your health than your doctor and you? Are there any politicians you would trust your child's life to? There are about 3 I like, but there are none I would entrust my child's life to when it matters.

> most don't actually meet a reasonable definition of that term.

I agree completely. However, there's no denying that the more market driven the service is, the better it is overall results. That's my point. Maybe there is a point of that where there's diminishing returns and a true free-market system wouldn't ultimately work long-term, but I say let's move things in that direction until we find that point, because there's a whole lot of good things that have been proven to come out of that direction (and a few bad things too, just to be honest, but the bad things are typically short lived).

>universal access model in Canada, France, and elsewhere provides good distribution of the social good of healthcare while controlling costs reasonably well.

There have been more people who die in both of those systems than their counterparts in the U.S. Do you remember the controversy about the woman used to advertise for assisted suicide in Canada? She said in an interview that she actually wanted to live, but the Canadian healthcare system decided not to make the treatment she needed available to her until long after she would suffer and die, and so she chose to have a doctor end her life early, while she was still able to be mostly normal. She isn't alone either, hundreds of people have also chosen the same when faced with the healthcare systems you want to implement here. France is looking (or may have already adopted) the same government sanctioned suicide as Canada. Had that woman been in the United States, she could have gotten the treatment in time, but by the time she was fed up with Canada's system, it was already too late even if she did come here. I can provide many more examples of similar stories if you want, but I think I've made my point. Flawed as it is, and sad as this is for me to say, the U.S. has the closest to a free-market healthcare system of any major nation in the world. If people want a single payer system, they can vote with their feet and go to places that have it. Instead of making the U.S. just another nation with the exactly the same system as everyone else, let's try an experiment and go the other way, and if it doesn't work, at least there will still be other options.

I assume that by that you mean that healthcare is so expensive that your kid might die because you can't afford treatment, yes? Well, a giant reason why healthcare is so expensive is because it's monopolized and overly regulated like I mentioned earlier. Go back and look at healthcare costs vs new regulations and you'll see that there's a very strong correlation between new regulations being added and costs rising significantly. Again, lasik which has much less regulation has done the opposite, it's gotten cheaper and better over time in spite of it being a type of healthcare as well.

You even mentioned that markets are a good way of regulating scarce resources. You don't think about it, but one of those scarce resources is the time of medical providers. There are people who go see a doctor for almost every little every sniffle they get because they have an insurance policy that covers that and clog the system, and COVID-19 didn't help at all because you could have it and not even know it, so people were just walking in to get a test because they heard someone sneeze 1 aisle over in the grocery store.

Before I make my next point, I realized I forgot to address one of your earlier points. Do you know what a Certificate of Need is regarding the construction of new healthcare facilities and how those get issued out?

How did you come to that conclusion? I honestly would love to hear your explanation. It sounds like you're saying that if we make abortions illegal across the nation, there will just be a black market for it. Here's the the thing though, while that's true, it means that we go from killing over 900,000 children a year to less than 10,000 on the black market, then we've saved 890,000 lives per year, most of them minorities! I don't see how that's not a major win.

>This is not why orphan diseases aren't pursued. They are not pursued because they aren't profitable. It is c-suites who refuse to research them, and bureaucrats who provide COMMUNIST public funding to research some of them.

Do you have any clue how absurd this statement is? Do you know how many cures for rare diseases communists have come up with verses capitalists? For every disease cure that emerged from a communist nation, there's over 90 from capitalist nations.

Secondly, free-market does not always mean super profit, it means that you are free to pursue whatever you want if you can figure out the means to procure the materials needed to do the research. Do you have any idea how many rare diseases were cured because someone was suffering from it and a friend or family member pursued a treatment for it? They didn't have to convince the establishment why materials needed for the research should be moved from other projects over to theirs, they rolled up their sleeves and found the materials wherever they could and got the research done. I admit that nowadays the healthcare system is closer to a communist system than ever so there is some of that going on, but even today, that research unfettered from the establishment still happens!

Under communism, you almost never get that kind of freedom unless someone powerful suffers from the rare condition by coincidence (or in a tiny handful of cases, because they were secretly made to suffer).

Sorry, I know I write walls of text, but that's because I run into so many people who have been failed in their education, told only about the vices of a free-market economy and none of the virtues, while told only about the never-before-seen virtues of socialist economic systems that we will get this time if we just switch to it, and are almost completely ignorant of the astounding number of dead bodies they have left behind and why that happened, just told that it'll be different the next time, like everyone has been told every time before. So I have a tendency to over-explain, to try and cram down years of economic knowledge in a few paragraphs. I'll try to cut it down a little bit further.

TLDR: The only systems in history that have constantly and predictably increased life expectancies and human wellbeing are those closest to a Free-Market economic system. Every other system has done the exact opposite, socialism, fascism, cronyism (what the U.S. has now), and communism. Free-market economic principles brought over 4 billion people out of abject poverty and privation in the last century alone. Those same principles can and would fix our flagging healthcare system.",Daramore,t2_x08vj,0,0,reddit2

jsd1w2s,t1_jrrnhym,2023-07-17 19:56:39,science,"Can you name a human made system that is 100% incorruptible?

If you say yes, I would like to hear how you came to that conclusion.

Here's the difference, in Capitalism, when it moves towards Cronyism or even becomes Cronyism, the leftover dregs of Capitalisms can be used to revert Cronyism back to a more Free-Market system because it still requires people to make choices, and that is happening now. Angel Studios just broke Hollywood's stranglehold on the Theaters with Sound of Freedom for example. I can name many more.

Under more socialist governments, when it does inevitably become corrupted (which it does every time and leaves large numbers of bodies in or on the ground when it happens), what recourse do the people have? Violently overthrow one corrupt regime to install the next corrupt regime over and over bringing about massive bloodshed and instability on a frequent basis?

When power is concentrated as it inevitably must be for socialism to function, then a bad person can cause untold amounts of damage. When power is dispersed far and wide, then we can whether many bad people because they don't have the power to affect the lives of so many. That's why power should be in the hands ultimately of the individual making individual choices, not in the hands of experts or leaders who often get it wrong even with the best of intentions.",Daramore,t2_x08vj,1,0,reddit2

If the company pays out massive dividends then they have paid the corporate rate and the individuals receiving it are taxed enough to bridge the gap so that the same amount in total is paid as if it were paid out as a salary. At least, this is how it works in Canada.

This is why you fight monopolization of the market, business grows larger than government then controls government and has government pay business to hire people or keep them on min wage. Its a loop of diminishing returns.  


First off we really do need a consumer tax, however it should be based on what your take home revenue is, everyone should get a tax card/account which gives you bonuses you can deposit and gives you your tax rate to pay when you buy things. Say under 20k a year in revenue intake/income you  are not taxed on food and educational items he rest is 10%, under 50k its 5%, under 100k its 10%, under 150k 15% under 250k its 20% over 250k its 60%. If you have kids whatever you pay in tax is reduced by 75%(because your level of consumption just skyrocketed). This system only cares about revenue intake so all sources of income, interest rates,401k,benefits,contract payouts,potential pensions, donations and what not are taxed.  


If its a business the minimum tax is based on the highest income earner, the highest is whatever your contract payout is, benefits,golden parachutes,early firing/repalceing,ect so if you get 10 mill pay out thats your income to base taxes on.  


The thing about business is it will always try and fill a need in the market if all big biz ended today it would be replaced by more stable small biz networks that are not draining local wealth to offshore it across the globe, if we can cater more to local economic ecosystems then they are more better able to take care of themselves in both maintenance,jobs  and social aid.

&#x200B;

Second off we will never get a better tax system since those with most of the wealth run everything. We must remove wealth from governance and the reason for it is simple those who want to be in government the most have the most to gain from gaming the market and system, as much like religion money is also to great an influence to be allowed near governance.  


That aside fiat currency is a bit crap too, we should base the value of the dollar on consumer/end user take home pay, vacation time, health benefits, pensions,ect. The reason for this is the market has gotten to a  point consumers are meaningless as executives gamble on each others business value which strangles the market and keeps it at the beckon call of the few with all the wealth.  


So you have to allow for alot of freedom of trade while preventing trade from being pooled to a few places or monopolized, about the only way to do that is change IP law either allow end users unlimited rights to gain access to and trade the single instance end user license they bought or open up all IP to revenue sharing where 30% max of revenue intake is sent to the IP owner. You diminish monopolization and the market will become more self righting since you have far more business able to replace other businesses.  


Any way you turn its a rabbit hole that tends to lop back in unfair ways, the trick is trying to maintain some sort of stability.",ZippyDSMlee,t2_mf6mw,1,0,reddit3

I believe that what you‚Äôre saying is that land is a limited resource with inherent value and should be taxed based on its value and potential value. You also posit that land cannot be hidden, thereby making it an excellent taxable item. Am I correct?

I am simply positing the notion that a company can exist and own no land (it can rent the space). A company can be highly valuable, have a huge income, but take up incredibly small land resources. By comparison, a yet farm may own a huge amount of land deemed ‚Äúunder-utilized‚Äù and therefore evaluated at a high taxable rate. The tree farm owner would have difficulty paying the tax on his farm (which has a high land to low income ratio) while an IT business, for example, might have a very low land to income ratio.

When we talk about taxing a company, we are further placing taxes on the employees, the shareholders, and the consumers. So if we're not to be disingenuous here, we should be saying that these groups should be even further taxed.

This is past the income tax, sales tax, property tax, and all of the other taxes we already pay.

Who do you honestly think pay the tax placed on a company? The ceo? Do you think that every company is run by a multi-billionaire ceo who is to be taxed in name of the entire company? Ceo's aren't always company owners. In fact, if the ceo makes millions every year, then they are most assuredly the ceo of a publically traded company, which means that the shareholders own the company.

If you can pay the best lawyers to find loopholes, why not close those loopholes, grandfather yourself into those benefits and prevent your competition from getting the same benefits?

As long as our international legal system is complicated (i.e. all government is not authoritarian or nonexistent), there will be people who exploit its inefficiencies.  


Sure you could increase corporate taxes, simplify the tax code, and do all sorts of quality of life benefits for the little guy, but barring seizure of assets or a complete (authoritarian) overhaul of our economic system, I don't think you could do anything to prevent a major corporation from rent-seeking. Why pay more corporate tax when you can just incorporate in another country friendlier to corporations and then suffocate your patriotic competition with your reduced costs?   


Even with all this in mind, the ""effective tax rate"" is likely higher than the data can show. After all, in order to influence the law, you need to buy off lawmakers. This is something of a tax. In a country with some hegemony of greedy lawmakers over virtuous ones, you can see the corporate tax rates decline over time and the corporations gain more money through lowering taxes than they lose through lining the pockets of the greedy. This decision is literally made by an accountant.  


People should stop looking at corporations as groups of people capable of human things like 'altruism' and 'fairness' and 'empathy'. People should shift their view of corporations to witless monsters composed of screaming flesh whose only skill is emotionless rent- and profit-seeking behavior.

The more we get taxed the more they charge and the less we have as a people AND a government. Which means corporations and politicians both get paid more. It's why socialism doesn't work, not to mention the lack of motivation for corporations or people to stay here and the inherent danger that comes with giving the government more say in your life than you have personally. We need to move back to pure capitalism with no tax breaks for companies that make it past a certain point. While moving our human values back to a level of general compassion through education. The only way is to build for the future. Continuing as we are won't work. Our tax system is backwards for what we need right now. Socialism just takes things even further that way by putting ""pretend"" pressure on companies who could just move or up prices and then pay off officials for allowing the price manipulation. They control too much for it to work. Let everyone compete and boost small business. Investing in ourselves is seemingly the only option. With the shutdowns right now people will hopefully bring the spending down to a place where the government can step in and say ""sorry, we work for the consumers now"". Where America goes the world follows and hopefully this is a fresh start for real ideas to collide from all ends because our homeless and addicts need a little more help. I say this because social policies seem to reduce costs in those areas for overall care with taxes included. Doing things like giving people a place and a few months help to get a job and get back on their feet. It seemingly goes against the Conservative mindset but when it's cheaper it's just another way to invest in the poor to better competition and fairness.

Those with less means can't just go, they can't just get a different passport, they can't escape. On the other hand like myself I gave up my residency a decade ago, I live on paper in China, yet get paid in Singapore and have obtained a very tax-friendly passport.

So the tax is still being paid at the same rate.

Typically what actually happens is that executives are granted stock options that they can exercise in the future for some dollar amount  per share, so no tax is paid up front, but when the option is exercised they pay tax on the difference between the fair value of the stock and the amount paid to exercise just as you would with ordinary income. Therefore, the tax is still being paid, just at a future date when the actual benefit is realized. It is no different than the executive being paid a salary and buying stock with it.

If the stock the executive now owns continues to increase in fair value, and the executive sells it, then yes that is taxed at a capital gains rate which is a reduced rate from ordinary income. But you as an individual can also take your after-tax salary and invest it in stock as well, and if it increases in fair value and you sell it, then it gets taxed  just the same as it would for the executive.

but the argument that not having a barrier to entry allows for low quality or scams is a valid argument, and worth looking at. but when you do look into it it really just falls apart. uber and lyft are great examples to compare to. 

Has their introduction ruined things? no it has caused prices to go down. 

Are they less safe than taxis with medallions? its hard so say becasue law enforcement agency have not kept track of assaults locations in away that we can aggregate it and compare. but there are many reasons to believe that uber and lyft are in fact safer than traditional taxis both for the driver and the passenger.
    For drivers - (a) customers who are drunk, abusive, sexually provocative, etc., get bad ratings, which gets rid of them very quickly (a customer with a rating of under 4 stars gets banned from using the service, and every driver has the option of refusing to take a rider whose rating is less than some figure he or she is happy with), and (b) the service is cashless and prepaid (at least where I am). That means that nobody is going to pull a knife on me for a cash box, because there isn‚Äôt one.
    For customers - (a) drivers whose ratings drop below 4.5 are banned. (b) The trip is tracked electronically - so if I were to pick up some drunken chick and take her 200 kilometers out of her way just to put more money on the clock, that would be tracked - and next day I‚Äôd be banned.

Amazon has a ton of losses that they carry over from the early years when they were financing like crazy to grow a massive logistics business, and they've always reinvested their profits into the business in a permanent growth state.  This is how they legally reduce their income tax liability.  Small companies do the same, but they usually stop at some point.  They aren't paying much corporate income tax when they start out between a lack of sales and investment into the company, but, at some point, most companies find an equilibrium point where they maintain the status quo and start to pocket the profit, which means they'll start to pay income tax(after their carry forward losses are used up or expired). 

 Certain companies, like Amazon, choose never to enter that state, and that means they pay less/nothing in income tax because that's what the tax code allows.

fmj1hyn,t1_fmik7mx,2020-04-05 21:12:27,science,"Sure!

First note that I'm talking about corporate income tax here, not payroll tax.

I think the logic you have in mind is something like this:

""Corporations have revenue and expenses, and these things are equal.  Tax is an expense.  Therefore, if tax goes up, revenue must go up in an equal amount.  That revenue comes from consumers.  Therefore, if taxes go up, the price to consumers must go up an equal amount.  Consumers are the ones paying the tax!""

You can probably already spot the glaring mistakes in this.  For one, revenue does not equal expense!  Corporations make profit.  So really, revenue equals expense + profit.  Any expense increase in one area must be funded by some combination of revenue increase, profit decrease, and expense decrease (in a different area).  And it just so happens that, Coronavirus aside, corporations are in an era of record profits, fueled in significant part by the steady decrease in taxes levied on them.

Second, corporate (income) tax is paid only on profit, not on total revenue.  So if you did actually have a corporation where revenue equaled expense, they wouldn't pay any tax anyway, regardless of the tax rate.  You're thinking of tax as a fixed expense, but it's not.

The model here is still a massive simplification, but it's much more accurate than the model you seem to have in mind.  Economics is very complicated and there's a lot of different things going on that drive firms pricing decisions.  For any individual company, you'd have to dig into the details of that company to really understand what a tax increase would likely do to their prices.  For the market as a whole though, while you may see an associated price increase, it would not be 1 to 1 with the tax increase.

TL;DR: The cost of corporate taxes is shared by consumers, workers, and owners; it is not solely paid by consumers.",SigaVa,t2_aiedd,3,0,reddit3

fmkajrp,t1_fmk7mt8,2020-04-06 04:55:15,science,"No problem!

See there's this thing called ""profit"" that corporations make.  In fact, it's the whole reason they exist!  Profit is money that a corporation takes in but doesn't spend; it's like extra money over and above a firms expenses.

This mean that if expenses go up, revenue does not go up to exactly match the new expense!  Instead, this ""extra money"" is used to partly fund the additional expense.  And right now, corporations have record high levels of this ""extra money"".

Competition is the natural state of the market and can only be stopped through some form of coercive intervention.
Even the most basic utilities companies are indirectly competing with other companies outside their market.
Even when a company is large, another large company will compete with it given the first is producing services or products in an expensive inefficient manner.
The only time a company can afford to relax is when it is granted a government monopoly status, not allowing anyone else to compete, nullifying the pressures of existing and potential competition.

The purpose of taxes is to drain money out of an economy at a rate that keeps the money from inflating at a rate that's too high. The other main tool being their federal reserves interest rate on money, high interest rates also have the power of slowing inflation and draining money out the economy.

The $25 trillion dollars US debt, which represents $25 trillion pushed into the economy and not drained out is about as much evidence that we need to prove that taxes don't matter in relation to government spending, and must have an entirely different purpose altogether.

Good thing that's not what I said then. But what I can say is that simply pushing growth without participation of all stakeholders should be stopped. Growth only in the name of raising the stock price and using those stocks as long term investments for a tiny part of the population is not a good thing for society. Growth in which workers and communities involved are also involved, where the wages grow at the same rate as the company does and local taxes are not waved simply because a warehouse monstrosity or minimum wage call centre is set up there. It's not about preventing growth, it's about sharing it among all stakeholders not just with the shareholders. 

> If you discourage companies from growing and evolving, they'll leave your country and make you poor and miserable.

As long as we have tax heavens that are allowed to function the way they do, this will happen, yes. It's almost like this is part of the changes that need to happen in the global trade system.

fmj8pq3,t1_fmj3q7y,2020-04-05 22:21:53,science,"How would a big company walk over the government? If you mean the company could just violate our rights, well, I don't mean a non existant government, I mean a government big enough so that it can guarantee our rights to liberty life and property, but small enough so that companies can't abuse its power for their own benefit.

You need to understand that bad big corporations can only exist if there's a big government backing them up. Let me explain. Imagine you open a can shop, at first you start small, you sell a few cans and eventually you gather enough money to expand your business. Fast forward a little bit and you're the biggest can selling business in your country. You sell the highest quality cans at the lowest price. You offer  your fellow men a great product at a low price, created thousands of jobs, fueled the economy with millions of dollars and overall made life better for other people and yourself. I wouldn't call you evil, not at all. Now let's look at another example. John opened a cardboard factory. John did well at first, and eventually transformed his small operation into one of the largest corporations in the country. John found out that a new company was rising up very quickly. Said company had innovated the cardboard market and could quickly put John's company out of business. Instead of adapting and lowering his prices or innovate too, he spends absurd ammounts of money in lobbying to pass a new regulatory bill  that puts that company out of business. Now, we miss out on the innovations and John now has a state given monopoly that allows him to do what he wants (and not what the customer wants). Would you call him evil? I would. He messed with the mechanisms of the free market for his own gain and everyone else loses.

There are two solutions to this problematic. Either we get rid of the corporations, effectively getting rid of John, but we also get rid of the hypothetical you. And we know letting the government take complete control of the economy doesn't end very well. The other solution would be to limit the government's ability to mess with the mechanisms of the market. That would force John to adapt and not screw over his competitors who force him to do better, or go out of business. 

If you have any other solutions I'd love to hear them",tsus1991,t2_14asta,1,0,reddit3

Without reinvestment, the tax base doesn't grow.  In this case, you are sacrificing corporate income tax to grow the number of employees(750k employees is a LOT of employees).  These employees that wouldn't exist without that reinvestment into growth pay their own income taxes, and the company pays their portion of the payroll taxes, and the expanded facilities to house these people have their property taxes, and the locales that they operate in have all of their local taxes, etc etc.  So one tax was sacrificed but boosted every other tax significantly, plus employed people, who pay their share of taxes as well.",Iohet,t2_9cb7r,1,0,reddit3

Public socialised healthcare is the only logical healthcare.  
Privatised healthcare does not prioritise the right things, namely profit.  Due to this there is no money in curing people, but continued reliance.  
Public healthcare for all advantages everyone, namely that if everyone is healthy everyone can work and contribute. 
 There are some things that do not work privatised and where profit should not be made for the betterment of everyone (including your beloved market and private enterprise).  Private enterprise sucks at critical infrastructure (power, water, health), long term investments (such as roads power etc where assets have 50 year life's and long term paybacks) and where natural monopolies are involved (again power, water, comms etc where it makes no sense having 2 sets of wires or pipes to people's houses).  They can't help but take advantage of their situations by profiteering or under investment.  Again sometimes profit is not and should not be the primary motivation.

Also the free market has been shown not to work without regulation.  The free market only operats under rules we set.  Show me somewhere that a fully privatised healthcare system is working for everyone, I'd love to see it.

Not all the time. As I gave the example in Europe, Amazon France pays ""fees"" towards Amazon Luxembourg for using the Amazon brand. Through this scheme a lot of their income is shifted towards expenses when the money was just sloshed around inside the corporation.

Most prefer a progressive income tax with a top bracket of approximately 75% instead, and taxes that broadly hit unused real estate, to approximate the wealth tax without the downsides.

* Piketty identified concentration of wealth as one of the biggest problems facing modern economics, he has broad agreement on that point. He identified wealth taxes as a historical method of fighting such things, but didn't support it as the only or best methodology for combatting such things.

* Zizek understands philosophy and psychology. These are related subjects to economics, but he doesn't used the math to actually study the subject matter.

> All of these things are things that add to the employee headcount and expand the tax base. 

Not in a linear fashion. You increase the volume of shipments from Amazon warehouses by 20% doesn't equate to a 20% increase in the number of employees they have. So in the end your scenario is valid, but with a very narrow application. In general, the state gives up tax income now to encourage growth that they can tax later. With the Amazon business model the state would never get to tax anything because the company is always growing, and they never have any profit in the classic sense. 

This all started from the (perceived) snarky remark that Amazon still pays the payroll taxes and property tax. And my point was that smaller businesses pay those AND the income tax because they don't have the huge numbers Amazon has to make such reinvestments for future growth. Just sticking to this initial comparison, which system is fairer to the local community and to the society at large? 200 x SMEs that employ 750k people and pay taxes at all levels or 1 x Amazon that employs 750k people and pays what we see it does?

The median rent in DC is $1550. Take home pay for $50k salary is $3208/month. That's 48% of take home pay just for a roof.

That's $3100 in monthly expenses for a *basic* lifestyle. In fact many of those costs are below the national average. How am I going to buy a house, save for retirement, or put my kids through college by saving $108 a month, living paycheck to paycheck, barely scraping by?

Purely on corporate income tax.  There are a variety of other more or less standard taxes, as I've indicated, that do increase.   And each jurisdiction has the capability of adjusting for that, whether it be local income taxes that do not have those exemptions/write-offs, value added taxes and ad valorem taxes to find taxes in other ways, etc.  

>  nd my point was that smaller businesses pay those AND the income tax because they don't have the huge numbers Amazon has to make such reinvestments for future growth. 

They *could*, but they choose not to.  It's not like Amazon *started* as a massive company with 750k employees.  Financing is dirt cheap and has been for a long time as interest rates have remained low for quite a while, and some companies take advantage of that and others don't.  

I completely acknowledge that are downsides to large businesses vs smaller businesses, but part of that should handled by local laws(cities that refuse to bring in the Walmarts of the world, enhanced tax codes, etc) and part of that is handled by reacting to the market(which *is* happening because we're in an era of craft markets at a local level, whether it's foodie farm to table restaurants, custom goods(furniture, clothing, etc), breweries/distilleries, etc)",Iohet,t2_9cb7r,1,0,reddit3

There could be many ways of defining efficiency: number of people housed; commercial use/potential; opportunity to create gateway for public transportation? It could be argued that any one of these competing uses would be more efficient than having people live in single unit homes.  And perhaps the single family house is, indeed, going the way of the Dodo bird. And yet, I still have compassion for the elderly who do not wish to be warehoused in a retirement residence, but wish to live out their days in their family home, which has been paid off for decades, and which they simply wish to maintain as long as they can live in it independently - which can be argued is another kind of efficiency (not having to live in government subsidized long-term care homes). 

People are being encouraged to get reverse mortgages to borrow money against the value of their homes in order to be able to continue to live in them. Is this what you propose? Can you see how that might be depressing to someone? All because we live in a world where people are trying to squeeze every ounce of ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù out of every possible system. Art is not ‚Äúefficient‚Äù. Democracy is not ‚Äúefficient‚Äù. Social work is not ‚Äúefficient‚Äù. It seems to me that economists and people with various political convictions are pushing to increase efficiencies at the expense of one class, while not really tending to the most obvious inefficiencies created by the wealthy. For example: where do yachts fit in in this land tax idea? Seems to me they might get over-looked. 

I still think that closing loopholes in the existing tax system, simplifying it, and keeping a consumption tax is the best way to level the inequalities in our existing tax system, which every 1%er knows, favours the wealthy. 
As for land tax: we all know that the wealthy hide their money in off-shore accounts, holding companies, trusts, etc. But the people who are just getting by? All they have are their houses.

csgntkl,t1_csgebnj,2015-06-24 02:51:32,science,"This is very cool actually! The biggest problem preterm babies have when they are born is with breathing. This is because their lungs don't produce a substance called surfactant. Surfactant acts to decrease the surface tension in the airways leading to deep inside the lungs. This is important because the muscles of breathing (primarily the diaphragm) can only generate so much negative pressure, without the decreased surface tension, the alveoli will not be ventilated. This is why when premature babies are born, we shoot surfactant into their lungs to help them breathe. Unfortunately, this method is only so good, any many babies go into what is called ""neonatal respiratory distress syndrome"" and some die. When a baby is born before the lungs are developed enough, they will not be viable. If I remember correctly (I'm on mobile so maybe someone else can double check me) this process is usually done around week 26. For these reasons, it makes sense, and previous research has showed, that the lungs send signals that are relayed to the mother about its development.

Steroids don't promote antenatal lung growth *per se*; rather, they stimulate type II pneumocytes to produce surfactant, reducing the chance of infant respiratory distress syndrome. The lungs themselves function in the sense that the diaphragm works, and air goes in and out just fine, but until a significant amount of surfactant is produced, actual gas exchange at the alveolar level is severely impaired. While tocolytics can temporarily delay labor (generally by ~48 hours), they can't stave it off forever; in the meantime, providing steroids allows enough surfactant production to make gas exchange somewhat effective.",thebellmaster1x,t2_37km7,28,0,reddit1

But, first of all, those 40 weeks are counted from the date of the last menstrual period, so that probably includes ~2 weeks before conception actually occurred. And, 9 months is more of an approximation, and also accounts for the fact that our months are longer than exactly 4 weeks by 2-3 days, depending on the month.

csgxder,t1_csgre78,2015-06-24 10:58:28,science,"Keep in mind, these aren't started until labor has actually been initiated prematurely. So I would think that there is something else other than SP-A that is able to begin labor, since the reason infant RDS occurs is due to a lack of surfactant production that early on. At the same time, surfactant production is generally sufficient by 34 weeks of gestation, and we don't administer steroids after that point (in the US; the UK has slightly different recommendations); however, there's still 4-6 weeks of gestation left. Perhaps surfactant production continues in excess of what I'd necessary for gas exchange, and that level triggers labor. 

If the effects are due to uterine inflammation as they say, I guess you could speculate that betamethasone or dexamethasone might reduce that inflammation and possibly delay labor a little bit, but in practice the steroids are given alongside a true tocolytic like albuterol or nifedipine.

About six months ago I left a job that I hated. It literally left me in tears on an hourly basis and was substainally below my skills and below what i needed to pay all my bills. After 3 weeks of not findiing work, i went to a temp agency. Who found me a position that was also well below my skills, but at least the benefits were there. The assignment ended four months later and again, i was unemployed. My father found out and he proceeded to scream at me for 20 minutes about being lazy, not working, not trying, when he had a student loan that was taken out for my education that he was paying, and that it was ridiculous for me to have luxuries (i don't actually have any luxuries. I rent a room in a house, barely eat, have a dumb phone, no movies or entertainment budget to speak of and my car just broke down, so i don't even have transportation, but still have to pay the loan/insurance on it). He told me I needed to apply at wal-mart, plaid pantry, bi-mart, etc. That it was inherently wrong for me to be holding out for a job at my competency at $15-$16/hour. I can't be looking down on jobs that I'm better than because unemployment hurts job prospects. And it's not like I wasn't trying. I didn't have the heart to tell him i had 3 interviews that week for positions that would all pay $15-$18/hour. I'm glad there's actually evidence to encourage me not to settle.

After getting hired, one of the recruiters asked to get lunch with me to catch up with how my new job is going.  I said sure.  You'd be a fool to pass up a chance to network with professionals.  We chatted, and he told me that his company is using MY RESUME as THE standard when telling potential prospects how to model their resume.

Alternatively, if he was loaded but did relevant volunteer work while in school, that is interesting too. A perfect GPA is less interesting. We also historically have focused on people with just a bachelor's degree because they can learn what we do on the job if they're smart. 

A resume has to be put together well, obviously, but someone needs to put it in my hand to be honest. I've had a kid reach out to me through linkedin even and I passed his resume on to a competitor that I knew was hiring even though we weren't. 100% of the people we've hired were referrals on some level - the least direct one I can think of is a kid who was roomates with a guy whose father was our client, and the client sent us the resume and we hired the guy for a summer internship.

Terrible work life balance and she was just getting sick from working so much. I get paid more than she does while working less (this was what prompted her to accept that the company wasn't for her because she still wants to have a life outside of work) so she asked for a raise based on what she has been doing but was denied since she was new.

Long story short, she ended up working for a while more and tried to interview for a position available in the department she wanted (engineering department) but didn't get it. 

So she left and cut her losses. Now first thing interviewers ask why she only worked in the job for less than a year and why it wasn't in the field of her degree.

However unemployment isn't mentioned in the next paragraph

> The study found that about 5 percent of men and women working below their skill level received a ‚Äúcallback,‚Äù or positive employer response ‚Äî about half the callback rate for workers in full-time jobs at their skill level. Similarly, less than 5 percent of men working part time received callbacks. However, part-time employment had no negative effect for women, and temporary agency employment had little effect for either gender.

Without filling in the data on how unemployment affects employment aspects there's a big piece missing here. Taking overqualified work is worse for your career than taking more challenging work, of course I can see that, but for many people it's not a choice between work at their skill level and work below their skill level, it's a choice between work below their skill level and unemployment.

Also of note is that ""callbacks"" are not a comprehensive indicator of job success, once you get that callback people who have taken temporary part-time work are going to be able to explain I took X so that I could fund living expenses, remain independent, fund a job search, e.t.c.

d0ngixk,t3_48wxsx,2016-03-04 16:18:30,science,"One of the more interesting results from our own Income Maintenance Experiments in the 70s, when we tested a basic income guarantee in the form of a negative income tax, was that men worked slightly fewer hours in year.

That may sound cut and dry. Obviously people who receive money regardless of work are going to work less, right? That's the assumption. But that wasn't the case.

What happened was that men spent more time between jobs, looking for the next job. Why did they do that? We don't know for sure, but it seems most likely that most of us want a job that best fits us.

We want a job we'll find some meaning in, that offer good hours, pay, and benefits. And so if we have the ability to hold out for a job that better suits us, because we are receiving income without conditions outside the labor market, then that's what we'll do. We will refuse jobs that don't pay enough. We will refuse jobs with terrible hours or no benefits.

So what are the effects of our not having this ability to wait for a better job? We are forced to accept any job. That means we accept lower pay. It removes pressure from employers to offer sufficient wages, so wages go down across the board, and then gov has to step in with market distortions like minimum wage laws.

We absolutely need the ability to never be forced to accept any job because it's better than no job. OP's article is just more evidence for this simple fact.

The way to obtain that power is through a basic income guarantee.

My degree helped me move into my third position which then moved onto my current position. I've been criticized for moving around a lot but each position is really like a particular chapter in my life and each is markedly different and similar at the same time.  

In college I could never understand the kids in my classes and my friends who wouldn't work at least part time or per diem. I was fortunate enough to grow up middle class with my mother handling my tuition but everything else was what I covered. I payed for the down payment on my car as well as the lease fees, I wasn't under her insurance because somehow it worked out in her favor for the car to be in her name, and all the other expenses. Right out of college I was able to get a job in my field simply by talking to people in the hospital who would know more and because of the reputation I had built up within the hospital people knew I was a hard worker and worth the shot no matter what the job was.

Even though it's better to take a lower paying job than no job at all, being stuck in a low paying job is extremely damaging to individuals with debt, especially individuals who have mountains of debt from obtaining the degrees that make them overqualified.

To use an extreme example, someone who has trained as a surgeon and accepts a job as a general practitioner will likely have more debt than someone who has trained as a general practitioner, but they will be at the same pay scale (which is around $100k less).

On top of that, a hospital is less likely to hire them as a surgeon in the future if they haven't spent as much time in an O.R. as other applicants.

I'm sure it does to an extent.  Job applications/interviews in general are a combination of your own skill/expertise/experience, with some luck added in.  The longer and longer you work as a bank consultant, frankly, it would make me more hesitant to even give you a phone call if I had 10 other applications with people more recently working directly on engineering.  As you said, it's still better than having huge gaps.  Make sure to still *actively* look for jobs.  Try applying for a *minimum* of 10 a week.  When I was looking for a job ~5 years ago, I  upped my job application rate from ~3-5 per week to 40-50/week (started applying to jobs anywhere nationally), and within a month I had a job (luckily in my same city).

> To examine the issue and measure how outcomes may vary by gender, Pedulla submitted 2,420 fictitious applications for 1,210 real job openings in five cities across the United States and tracked employers‚Äô responses to each application. All applicant information was held constant, including six years of prior work experience, except for gender and applicants‚Äô employment situation during the previous year.

Even the abstract would help to inform people's discussions on this research: 
> Drawing on original field and survey experiment data, I examine three questions: (1) What are the consequences of having a nonstandard or mismatched employment history for workers‚Äô labor market opportunities? (2) Are the effects of nonstandard or mismatched employment histories different for men and women? and (3) What are the mechanisms linking nonstandard or mismatched employment histories to labor market outcomes? The field experiment shows that skills underutilization is as scarring for workers as a year of unemployment, but that there are limited penalties for workers with histories of temporary agency employment. Additionally, although men are penalized for part-time employment histories, women face no penalty for part-time work. The survey experiment reveals that employers‚Äô perceptions of workers‚Äô competence and commitment mediate these effects.  

Very interesting that underemployment (in terms of skill) is about equivalent to unemployment, which suggests that it doesn't really matter whether or not you're taking a job just to pay the bills (as opposed to someone who had savings to sustain themselves for a while). This probably arises from the pragmatic decision by employers to weed out applicants perceived to be ""rusty"" after being away from the forefront of their field.",monarc,t2_bu53w,29,0,reddit2

Here is my resume for all who are interested. I graduated in May 2015. The main things I want to draw attention to here:

The highlights section. This is the thing that has drawn the most praise. People looking through resumes look at your resume for like, 30 seconds. TOPS. Give them your best highlights and accomplishments straight up front.

Make EVERYTHING you do sound way more important than it actually is. (look at my IT experience) I did straight up bitch work, but it's how you word it. (I repaired broken computers that people brought us and I built computer stations from the box VS I helped maintain data infrastructure, access to pertinent information to enable the full functionality of the workforce) Make your job description sound WAY more important that it actually is.

Lastly, don't lie... Have some self respect, creativity, and personality.
I hid all info that could potentially identify me.

Take a weekend and drive out there to take some photos of yourself at various locations to document your faux experience. Read a book on the area and study as much as you can in case they ask you ""gotcha"" questions. It'll become a talking point of the interview and serve as a cultural ""learning experience"". It also demonstrates that you have ""balls"" to do something unusual. Some companies overvalue those sorts of things on your resume (*cough* google recruiting *cough*) and can be easily duped by an artful liar who goes the extra step of documenting and researching their lies.

Reference: *I'm a good liar with a successful record of dupping recruiters in the past.*

Other ideas:

* I went backpacking in Alaska
* I spent a year at a Buddhist meditation retreat
* I sailed a boat to Chili
* I spent a year in Paris learning to cook
* I went on a vision quest
* I spent a year surfing the shores of Australia
* I spent a year learning to take over my dad's pizza shop

It's always best to go with lies that are closest to your actual experience and interests. It'll reduce the amount of research you'll have to do and you'll sound more passionate.

Tips for being a great liar:

* Keep the lies as basic as possible
* Interleave as much truth as possible
* Don't lie about things that can be easily verified by a background check
* Produce documentation just in case
* Don't lie about subjects you know absolutely nothing about
* Devote yourself to researching background information to support the lie
* Embarrassing lies are more believable than lies that make you look good. If your lie is you trained for the Olympics, then your reason for quitting is you failed to qualify for any competitions. As luck turns out, you're a terrible athlete. If you tried to take over your dad's pizza shop, then you're a terrible pizza maker. If you tried to start a farm, the you're a terrible farmer.
* Assume the interviewer has intimate knowledge of the subject so prepare to answer questions
* Avoid lying about things that would normally produce documentation. Example: starting a business would be documented with the state; starting a website shows the time you first registered the domain; education products transcripts, etc.
* Don't voluntarily give specifics until asked
* Rehearse constantly leading up to the interview
* Assume they believe you. Confidence and passion sell a lie.
* Don't speak softly. Speak at a good volume, look people in the eye, and smile as you talk. Be chipper and cheerful.
* When caught in a contradiction, admit you remembered wrong.
* If you sense you're about to be grilled about your lie, pre-empt by asking intelligent questions about the job or the interviewer's role with the company. The interviewer only has limited time with you before the next interviewer comes in, so chew up time by driving focus to them and the company.",,,1,0,reddit2

The problem with focusing your energy on blaming luck for negative outcomes is two-fold:  
  
1) You may, in your focus on blaming luck, miss subtle opportunities where you can change an outcome.  These may not always be obvious, initially, but I do believe spending a lot of time focusing on bad luck can blind us to potential good luck, which of course by not noticing we assume never existed--we only ever get bad luck!--and the cycle spirals downward.  
  
2) Blame implies fault.  Fault is a real thing, and it should be okay to acknowledge it from time to time, but fault is not the same as responsibility.  It may not be your fault that X, but now it's your responsibility.  That sucks.  No sarcasm intended--sometimes X really, really, really sucks.  I've had my X in life.  It sucked.

That aside, sometimes it has even helped with the entrepreneur bit of my life. In the times I wasn't looking for supplemental cash I was able to convert it to a higher level job over time.  Quickest was from an 4 week contract entry level job, to middle management in 6 months. 

Going in at lower than your skills with the attitude that they are getting a deal (and selling that) because you just want something to fill your time, for the right job, can be a major advantage for you.  It will be easier for them to spot your talents and give you opportunity to save the day.   But if you do this don't get trapped in your underemployment.  Keep looking and leverage your experience.

The resume is what will catch the eye, and the problem is people will send a generic CV for big jobs. I'll tell you right now, 99% of hiring staff don't read the second page. If you can't summarize yourself nicely in one page, don't bother.

Your primary concern is that everything they need should be on your resume's first page. You can add extra information, like references on the second page. You're applying to be a supervisor but have been working as Subways for the past 6 months? Don't even mention those 6 months, or put them on the second page, and focus on your experience relevant to being a supervisor, your quality. 

There is no humility and humbleness in a CV, you sell yourself hard, just don't lie, ever, that shit will get you right in the nuts.

Oh and **be persistent with resumes**. You really wanna work somewhere and an opening is still open? **Go in every week and bring in a resume until they either give you an interview or their shredder is jammed.** First, it shows you really wanna work there, and real enthusiasm about a job offer will not go unnoticed. Second, if the hiring staff is lazy and throws out half the stack right off the bad, then having several CVs in that stack will be good. Third, sometimes it depends on the hiring person's mood as well. One day he's looking through the stack and he's in a bad mood and he's being super picky so he throws almost all resumes away. The next morning he's rested and less edgy and finds your CV again in the stack and this time he thinks your fine. Boom interview.

Oh and if you do get the call, do tell them that you brought in a few resumes over time, so they don't waste time. I was once called 3 times in a day by the same company, 'cause my CVs was all over the stacks, and I guess the person going through was seeing so many names that you can't remember an exact one when you review it again.

Just to give an example, take two software developers:

The first guy is just a mediocre developer, but he has a blog with 20,000 followers, a polished LinkedIn profile, a nice GitHub profile with samples of things he's done, and useful open source tools he's written. He goes to conferences and meets people. He has a good personal network that he can use to find more opportunities, and he has good interpersonal skills, and interview skills, and he cleans up really well.

The second guy is a rockstar developer. He wrote his current company's entire system from scratch, and he knows exactly how everything works. He could code circles around the first guy, but he doesn't have a blog, he doesn't have a github, basically he doesn't have an internet presence at all. He also doesn't network. He doesn't go to conferences because he thinks they're a waste of time. Nobody outside of his current workplace even knows who he is. Actually, even in his current workplace, most people don't know who he is. He doesn't talk to anybody but his boss and one or two close coworkers. In general, he doesn't interact well with others. He's condescending, rude, and has a sloppy personal appearance.

The first guy will have recruiters spamming him every day trying to get him to work for a few dozen different companies. He even gets emails directly from hiring managers offering him jobs. Basically, he can have his pick of jobs, and if he posted that he was looking, within hours he'd have another job lined up. I guarantee it.

The second guy, lets say he gets laid off, even though he is massively more skilled than the first, will languish in obscurity. He'll send out resumes, but he's not that great at communication, so his resume sucks. It gets ignored. He doesn't have a LinkedIn profile, so he's not getting messages from recruiters, they don't know he exists. So he stays unemployed for months. Maybe he even gets a few interviews, but because of his appearance and interpersonal skills, he doesn't get the job.

Now, maybe that's a little bit of an extreme example, but I think it's a lot more common than people think.

People tend to assume that just because they have a job right now, they can ignore networking and self-marketing, and sometimes that leaves people who've been at the same job for many years REALLY out of the loop if they get laid off.

Which to me depending on the context of what the job is about, gives them at least a chance.

Similar to people with degrees, just having a degree does not mean you are any good etc Having a bit of solid experience is what matters, the length in general does not matter.

For example, you could work as a team lead for 3 years but only really gain 6 months of pure experience, the remaining 2.5 years is just re-iterating that skill set. While someone else could work for a year as team lead, but have a much more technical and directed role yielding an entire years worth of experience.

Here is my resume for all who are interested.  I graduated in May 2015.  The main things I want to draw attention to here:

The highlights section.  This is the thing that has drawn the most praise.  People looking through resumes look at your resume for like, 30 seconds.  TOPS.  Give them your best highlights and accomplishments straight up front.

Make EVERYTHING you do sound way more important than it actually is.  (look at my IT experience) I did straight up bitch work, but it's how you word it.  (I repaired broken computers that people brought us and I built computer stations from the box VS I helped maintain data infrastructure, access to pertinent information to enable the full functionality of the workforce)  Make your job description sound WAY more important that it actually is.

Lastly, don't lie...  Have some self respect, creativity, and personality.

The reason being PhDs are traditionally managers in research/development. A company doesn't need as many managers as they do people performing benchwork, thus they can only hire/promote when a manager leaves. This is why PhDs in biotech typically end up with a job that someone with a Masters or Bachelors can fulfill.

In terms of more jobs in biotech vs engineering, I'm not entirely sure, I work in a biotech development lab, and most of us are Chem-Es (I'm from the bio side).

Yes and depending on a multitude of things it could be 3 sigma, 6 sigma or whatever but based on the data set in the article (which I can now read) it could be viewed as more a Ppk result not a Cpk result with a sigma value unknown.

> The study found that about 5 percent of men and women working below their skill level received a ‚Äúcallback,‚Äù or positive employer response ‚Äî about half the callback rate for workers in full-time jobs at their skill level.

As for that, it's more of a test that most would know the outcome to. If an employer is given the opportunity to choose a person that is at his/her skill level, it's an easier decision as the learning curve (or what ever) is smaller so therefore, cheaper or a quicker return on investment. It's been the way of things for a very long time.

> ‚ÄúThe study offers compelling evidence that taking a job below one‚Äôs skill level is quite penalizing, regardless of one‚Äôs gender. Additionally, part-time work severely hurts the job prospects of men,‚Äù Pedulla said.

Then there is this. The title of the article states ""can adversely effect"" but here, it's now ""compelling evidence"" and ""penalizing"". 

The environment today is close to the same as in the late 80's. Plenty of workers but not a lot of higher paying jobs.

I think this attitude partly stems from our school system where you do a certain amount of work and you get promoted to the next grade.  Nothing really matters besides meeting a very rigid set of pre-determined requirements.

This leads to a misunderstanding of the real world where networking, the way you present yourself, and the way you do your job are just as important as meeting these rigid minimum standards.

I interview lots of kids who come out of school thinking they are ""graduating"" into a high paying job.

Also, there aren't 100 applicants for every job right now. The US is at or near full employment. Currently unemployment is at 5.5%. The definition of full employment varies somewhat, but most definitions put it near where we are now. From Wikipedia's full employment section: 

> The 20th century British economist William Beveridge stated that an unemployment rate of 3% was full employment. Other economists have provided estimates between 2% and 13%, depending on the country, time period, and their political biases. For the United States, economist William T. Dickens found that full-employment unemployment rate varied a lot over time but equaled about 5.5 percent of the civilian labor force during the 2000s.[2] Recently, economists have emphasized the idea that full employment represents a ""range"" of possible unemployment rates. For example, in 1999, in the United States, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) gives an estimate of the ""full-employment unemployment rate"" of 4 to 6.4%. This is the estimated unemployment rate at full employment, plus & minus the standard error of the estimate.[3]",mister-noggin,t2_ds56p,6,0,reddit2

Look, I told people a policy of ensuring general independent access to college was just a hand-wave to re-brand ""Workforce Development"" as ""Education"" and ignore education itself, and that it only functions as a hand-out to businesses at the expense of an employee.  They don't listen.  Even when they do listen and fully understand, they start stuttering and mumble something about how we should just *make* businesses behave, because they don't want us to take something away from them.

It's like you gave them poisoned food, and showed them how we can ensure *everyone* can get food *but* we have to stop distributing poisoned food; and they all say, ""No!  You can't take our food away!"" even though you're proposing to eliminate the constant sickness they suffer from and ensure more stable access to food.  They want the guaranteed hand-out.

I've taken a different tactic.  I'll fix a different problem to try to improve the situation, but this iron weight of Government efforts to get everyone independently responsible for shining themselves up as a ready-to-go, off-the-shelf, cheap, commodity worker is going to drag on you all.

Does this mean that we play by their rules? Playing a game with a rigged system? No, I do believe that we, as individuals, are the only ones responsible for ourselves.

Here's a suggestion: a paralegal corresponds to everyone in the medical profession between an orderly and a nurse practitioner.  A JD working as a paralegal is sort of equivalent to an MD working as a nurse practitioner.  Because while paralegals can be anything ranging from secretaries to basically lawyers, if a paralegal has a JD you can bet he/she will be doing more sophisticated work relative to other paralegals with no JD.

My firm has numerous paralegals who have starkly different roles depending on their qualifications.  One of them has a JD, and he's basically doing the same work a first-year associate would do (research for more senior attorneys).  The distinction is merely that he will be doing this for the rest of his career.  He's cool with this because 1) he failed the bar once, so unless he wants to try again he can't be a full lawyer; 2) he'll continue to develop intellectually and professionally in his current role; 3) he gets paid just as much as he would if he were a lawyer (maybe more, actually) because he's willing to do bitch work all day long.

Currently, the legal market has a ton of unemployed young lawyers, and a bunch of job openings for paralegals.  If you're an unemployed young lawyer who didn't go to a great school, or maybe didn't pass the bar the first time around, or who just loves legal research and hates dealing with clients, you might want to consider a career as a paralegal.

It's the employers job to find the most suitable candidate, if they're only looking at one particular entry in a persons work experience history and basing their decision on that alone then it's their own decision making process that's flawed.

I'm in this predicament now, I had a tech related job for two years straight out of college but got fired once they got into a lot of debt and were firing the high paid employees to bring in people who would work for cheaper.

I couldn't find a job, unemployment benefits ran out so I had to go back to the part time job I had while going to college. Then my mom had a lot of health issues and had multiple doctor visits per month so I was stuck at the part time job.

d0oa976,t1_d0o2eo7,2016-03-05 06:00:25,science,"I don't think that is actually true.  Maybe I'm wrong though.  Does the anchoring concept not apply to negotiating a salary?  

The first person to say a number sets the bar from which negotiations start.  If I say I want 75k but really I'm going for 70k I think I'd be in a better position than if they said 65k and I try to go up to 70k.  

Whenever I go in for the raise discussion I start by saying I want more than I actually expect them to give me.  In many cases I've gotten what I've wanted or what I actually ask for.  Granted they have to actually need you or want you for the job.  

Typically you're not going to be looked down on for asking for the high end of what could be reasonable pay for the job.  They'll just counter offer.  

Another tips is always ask for more, pretty much no matter what.  Don't be pushy just ask because odds are you actually do want more.  You may be surprised with the results.",thats_so_over,t2_6ntda,1,0,reddit2

d0qlra5,t1_d0o22f7,2016-03-07 09:56:25,science,"I thought I responded earlier.  I'm sorry your experience was not as positive as mine was.  I had the fortunate opportunity through scholarship to attend the one of the most expensive schools in the area (Pittsburgh) where tuition exceeded the cost of my university.  Despite the obvious economic disparity between myself and my peers, I don't think I was ever put into an uncomfortable situation.  Staff and faculty were all wonderfully supportive.  

For high school I went to a school that had issues with gang violence, attendence, teenage pregnancy.  I think someone was expelled once for bringing a gun to school.  It was here that I was let down by my school administration.  Because I was bound for college, no one urged me to consider my options.  I think I barely made it through the application process and was left to my own devices to learn more around admissions and scholarships.  My test scores were right at the cusp of a full ride for any number of universities, given that I had taken the tests early I had ample time to try again.  But despite the fact that I had a guidance counselor, I found out too little too late.  I didn't apply to any Ivy leagues, because there was no way to afford them.  Fortunately for many, if you are accepted and demonstrate sufficient need they waive tuition and at my income level, would have waived room and board - this too I found out on my own too late.  While they weren't malicious, they were unsupportive because I was one of the few that showed any sort of aptitude and I would do fine left to my own devices.  

They weren't wrong, missing out on a world class education, being forced to work 30hr weeks on top of a full class load made me hungry for something that being awarded a full ride wouldn't have.  But I know that if I had been able to attend this wealthier school in high school, they would have ensured that I wouldn't just do fine, but would have excelled.  While there is an obvious gap in the resources available, it is not very resource intensive to convey to a student that expensive universities are not expensive for everyone or that retaking a test could improve my chances at something worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.  I think a good and supportive education is somewhat independent of the cost and more rooted in the mentality of of the administration.  Again, sorry that your school experience wasn't as supportive as it should have been.",firstraise,t2_vm71h,1,0,reddit4

Any halfway conscientious manager will be on your side when it comes to salary negotiations. If your hiring manager won't help you get a good starting salary, why would you think that person would help you get a raise in a year or three years when you go ask for one?

You get to choose from three managers:

One manager won't tell you the salary range but expects you to throw out s figure. Hang up. This is a manager who will click sympathetically when you ask for a raise in two years, but who won't actually talk to his manager.

The second tells you the salary range. His manager will take your request for a raise to his boss and get an out-of-cycle raise approved for you. This is a decent manager.

The third tells you the range and tells you what you should ask for within that range. This is a manager you'll never need to ask for a raise, because he'll bring you in higher than you ask for, and will ensure your salary goes up before you ask for a raise.

Turning a basic question into a game of chicken means you're throwing away a very good chance to assess which of those three people you're talking to, and instead you're taking the conversation in an unnaturally adversarial direction.

And future employers won't look down on it, especially in the context of a recent move thanks to your wife's job.  If anything, they'll see it as noble.  This would marginally increase your chances of landing a stable, decent job as an attorney (something in the $50k range depending on the market).  Just the act of getting into the workforce and meeting other attorneys will increase your chances of getting a job, more so if your work is good.  But there's every risk that you could do the pro bono work for a while, get the experience, and still have trouble finding consistent work as an attorney.  That's just the harsh truth of the job market today.

So, the short answer is that if you can't find work as an attorney, but want to stay in the legal field, I'd at least consider it, because I'm not sure what your other options are.  The pay is probably better and definitely more consistent than what you make from your solo practice.  The job might be more intellectually rewarding as well; I don't know what fraction of your time is spent in Traffic Court, but I'd rather use my degree as a paralegal than waste it there.

I'm not telling you to do it, but I'd at least look into your options.  Especially if you end up in another state, at least consider it before signing up for another bar exam.  The world needs good paralegals in a bad way.  And lawyers are a dime a dozen.",pointis,t2_67lzz,1,0,reddit4

I guess if I'm given some responsibility for the overall success of a project, I feel like I should be paid for it.  

It seems like that used to be the way internships were.  It was a way to earn a little money while trying out a field to see if you like it, and maybe it could turn into a real gig later.  At this point internships have become requisite to get a paying job, so it's really not ""volunteering"" if people are expected to be underpaid or work for free for a while before they can earn a livable wage in their industry.

I expect this means you threw out a number, she said, ""That's too much,"" and basically hung up? I read this as you having avoided a terrible manager.

> Me: Before we go on, what salary range are you looking at for your next role?

> You: Well, what is your salary band for this position?

> Me: How strange that you won't answer my question.

> You: And you won't answer mine.

> Me: We're at a standstill then?

> You: Ugh, fine, um, $150k.

> Me: Okay, this is a junior software engineer position we're talking about here. The range is $90k-$110k. I've got a intermediate software engineer position open too, the range there is $110k-$130k. After that, we're getting to senior software engineer roles, which requires more experience than you have; and then the tech lead role, which also has a managerial component, and I don't think you're ready for that. How about this: let's consider you for the junior role right now, and set up a technical phone screen for that role. If it turns out you blow that out of the water, then we can rethink whether we should be talking about the intermediate software engineer re for you instead. How does that sound?

If you're interviewing somewhere and get penalized for answering a question you've been asked - particularly one you've tried not to answer! - then that should tell you a lot about how that manager is going to be on a day to day basis.

(Finally: my example above is pretty contrived, because I don't use the power imbalance inherent in an interview setup to force a candidate to answer a question they've clearly signaled they don't want to answer. I would instead skip ahead to talking about the salary range for the role at hand.)

A lot can change in a year these days.  Their skills won't be as relevant as they were a year ago if they spend a year out of the workforce.  There are over a hundred applicants for most positions, a dozen or two could be interviewed, and one gets the job.  Why should someone that did something like that get the position over all of those other people that chose goals more in line with what the hiring company had in mind?  You don't have a right to work for someone else.  It's a privilege.  One that you earn by showing your worth.  If you want to have complete freedom, find a way to work for yourself and get paid for it.

>You're perpetuating a mentality that has billions of people being slaves to the system. Technological advancements should be taking society to a point where people don't feel immense pressure to be spending 40-60 hours a week in an office working for something they don't care about. If we can suppress the greed of those in power, we can get to a point where we have a prosperous society that only requires its members to contribute a small fraction of their time to ""work"", and allows them to take time off to have fun and improve upon themselves.

People are slaves because they choose to be slaves.  They choose what's safe, or familiar.  They abandon their dreams to the 9-5, two kids, and a family dog.  What do you think is supposed to happen?  That you should be able to risk nothing and live a life of leisure as a result?  You haven't earned it.

There won't be any suppression of greed in our lifetime.  Money is power, not even a revolution will change that.  For the record I dislike the current state of things.  The way to fix our society is to design a self learning AI and hand over governance to it but that may never happen.

This is the key to a good internship, having somewhere where your employer continously challengs you to take on bigger, better and harder tasks. However, a lot of employers don't want to take that effort if the intern itself is just sitting there to ""complete his college"".

Why? it's not the kind of intern he might hire later on at the company. A lot of companies hire old intern because they basicly know how the ball rolls at said company.

For me, that's the problem. Our current social structure kind of forces people into having to work. Additionally, high school kids are constantly being told they are supposed to go to college, and it's easy to take out these loans and not realize you pretty much just signed a contract forcing you to work for big corporations for the next 10+ years of your life.

Seems to me like we're on the same page though. From the perspective of somebody hiring, you have so many applicants, obviously you're going to have to knock off like 80% of them without being able to fully assess them.

>The way to fix our society is to design a self learning AI and hand over governance to it but that may never happen.
That's pretty out there, but in theory it's definitely something we could aim for. I like to picture a society where we are able to automate everything, gathering resources, producing items, building homes, etc. Socialize the crap out of everything, guarantee everyone a home and food and all the essentials.

There are a lot less senior people in the office, and I see no reason for any one short of management to share their salary. If you are asking for the same salary as someone who has worked there 5 more years than you, then you are either doing it wrong or you better be overachieving. The point is that if someone who is a lot newer than you makes more than you, you can renegotiate.

Management should be talking to each other about how much they make too. This only ends in a net boost in salaries for everyone.

Sure you can, to some extent at least. If your operational definition of race is based on appearance, or even perceived appearance, then genetics can play a role. Genetics can certainly dictate things like skin tone, facial structure, and hair texture, which are common factors that many people use to define race.

>But that doesn't address my point that differences between groups doesn't necessarily support the idea that those differences are due to discrimination based on those differences.

It **necessarily** does.  You are literally trying to argue that there is some genetic difference that would cause black police officers to be more likely to misbehave than white police officers.  And it has to be genetic in nature, because black Americans have almost zero knowledge of their African cultural roots.  As a group they are as thoroughly American as possible, because their African roots were intentionally stripped away.

&#x200B;

>Sure you can, to some extent at least. If your operational definition of race is based on appearance, or even perceived appearance, then genetics can play a role. Genetics can certainly dictate things like skin tone, facial structure, and hair texture, which are common factors that many people use to define race.

I guess you've never noticed the incredible breadth of skin tones, facial structures, and hair textures just among African Americans, much less those of eastern Africa, western Africa, and southern Africa.  Even northern Africa, excluding the Berbers and other Arabic ethnicities.

>Ethnicities generally aren't all that important when defining a race, as race is more broad and generalized, whereas ethnicity is much more specific to a nation/community.

And what I am telling you is that there are multiple individual ethnicities in Africa, each with more genetic diversity than the entirety of the ethnicities we think of as European.  There is more genetic diversity in people of African descent than in all other ethnic groups **combined**.  Hell, there is more genetic diversity in people of Middle Eastern descent than the **remaining** ethnic groups combined.

Do you understand yet?

>Race and ethnicity are certainly a tangled mess to deal with, and maybe it's not even worth trying to sort out in such a globalized world.

It really isn't.  The only field it would be truly useful for are genetics and medicine.  This study is more about perceived race.",xdre,t2_5uv8y,0,0,reddit2

been devastating, and it appears that Reddit is the latest casualty of this ongoing trend. 

This account, 10 years, 3 months, and 4 days old, has contributed 901

The change resulting from distress is called Phasing. The percentages are fairly high that a person will phase once or twice in their lifetime. Some people may experience more. 
The idea behind phasing is that your base personality need (think, first floor foundational need, which is not getting met and why you are in distress) becomes redefined by your next level up. Your second story need. The first floor is still important to you, but you desire a different need and maybe it is more possible for that need to be met, giving you some positive framework to interact in your world.  Your base is still important, but you have a different relationship with that part of your personality and how you filter the world.

gugbrka,t3_mqf265,2021-04-14 04:23:01,science,"There's nothing inherently wrong with having your personality changed. I've been in a toxic work environment for the past two years and can honestly say I've seen tremendous personal growth as a result. 

When you're dealing with what you think is poor communication, the response should be to first be to work on some introspection to ensure you're not the problem. If you're certain you're not and you've validated that against a few sounding boards, the next step becomes trying to adjust your communication style to fit the audience. 
Research team dynamics and keep trying things. 

Its when you give up that the toxic culture prevails over you. Then again, this is if you actually do believe in what you do and are vested enough to see the company succeed despite the toxicity associated with the currently employed. I'm not wanting to imply that you shouldn't look for greener pastures, rather there are still lessons to be learned and opportunities to positively develop your personality. 

Western psychology  states to focus only on what you can control and just accept whatever else. I find people use this to sell themselves short far too often as they haven't even made the effort to see what they can change within themselves that will have a positive output on their situation.",PMinisterOfMalaysia,t2_hjrks,7,0,reddit3

gugra9f,t3_mqf265,2021-04-14 07:54:18,science,"I was a CVS pharmacy technician for about 5-6 years and I was burnt out by the end. They were understaffed and more responsibility fell on me. My anxiety levels shot through the roof and I would lose sleep at night worrying about the next day of work. I just depended too much on the paycheck. I was only making $10.44/hr and they wanted me to be lead tech with no significant pay increase. 

I received a job offer that double my pay which was a M-F 9-5 gig with not so great health insurance and it was a glorified call center. I took it just to get out of CVS and the pay was a huge bonus. But I only lasted a year and a half there because the other employees were toxic, and I got to antsy sitting all day. I ended up gaining 30 lbs because it was a sedentary job and I would get home late and not want to do anything. It led to depression and issues in my relationship with my then girlfriend (now wife). 

I took a paycut from that job to work at a hospital in the emergency as a med tech and saw how nurses and doctors worked with patients so I switched over to nurse aide while going back to school for nursing. I'm almost done with school and emergency medicine has given me a new outlook. The health insurance is amazing. I basically don't pay anything at all for doctors visits and a minor surgery I had. They even offer $15 massages for about 60hrs/year which is amazing. 

Being a nurse aide isn't easy, it is stressful at times and the turnover rate is higher than one would like but my coworkers are very supportive. The nurses are easy to talk to and you can have great, informative conversations with the doctors. 

So to end my long story, I started from the bottom where I was miserable, left to where I thought the grass was greener on the other side (paid more but crappy benefits) which it definitely wasn't greener, to where I'm at now which is pretty great all around and I have new inspiring goals. I want to do something in nursing informatics or maybe even push for Nurse Practitioner. And all of these experiences have changed my attitude/mindset, but definitely for the better. I'm happy with who I am today.",WayoftheWill,t2_493kyh3k,1,0,reddit3

But all they do is propose that long term ""stress"" could alter an individual's epigenome and thus could change their personality. There are two giant logical leaps here: that stress does alter epigenome and if it does then that alters personality.

guh82ck,t3_mqf265,2021-04-14 12:03:06,science,"After learning about epigenetics it gave me a greater perspective on all the things we do like diet, stress, habits. Only about 1% of your entire genome produces proteins that are responsible for the various functions of your body. Though much is still unknown, the rest of your genome regulates what parts are expressed, repressed, and how much a gene will be expressed. Where things like stress come into play is there are these little ‚Äútags‚Äù that attach to your DNA which are responsible for the turning on and off of genes and these tags can be added at any point in your life based on what you‚Äôre doing. So if you are constantly stressed at work these tags may be added or removed to a gene that encodes for a chemical that dampens your mood for example. The most amazing thing about all this is that these tags are inheritable meaning that the decisions your great great grandparents made could literally have an impact on how YOUR body functions. These tags are the same reason two identical twins can have very different levels of health and disease just based on the decisions they make in their life. It is also important to note that these tags CAN be added or removed for the better just by changing your lifestyle for the positive. Well there is still much that is unknown about gene regulation, just take care of yourselves y‚Äôall.",rjsav98,t2_1qttrlb0,1,0,reddit3

I'm a little hung up on this bit because it's frustrating and bizarre. I know that it's valuable to do studies and research into commonly known things, but it can't be that we're only now asking ourselves ""are personalities malleable,"" right? Is this not something psychology has explored? 

(Part of the reason this is frustrating to me is that people use this type of thing as a reason to call research useless. ""We already know that and our government is wasting money on it??"" is said far, far too often.)",honest-miss,t2_122qwsxp,1,0,reddit3

You have the constant battle of not being listened to, and when finally deciding to be honest with them regarding why you're struggling, you're being ignored or treated as a burden. It was the pressure they added daily, the working short, being mandated for holes, and still having tasks dumped on you. It was the favoritism they offered some employees that ultimately screwed the rest of the team and created division. It was the expecting the world out of their staff, repeatedly upping expectations, while the management got to leave at 3 or 4pm. I opened up about how the stress of work was getting to me, ultimately causing depression, and was told by management, ""Maybe you should consult your doctor for some medication."" Since when should we have to numb out to get by at work? What happened to pulling together and solving problems? I thought teamwork was held as a priority and employee concerns were tools to be utilized for changes? I quit this past weekend. I put my immediate resignation in after yet another 16 hour shift alone... without a backup plan I made the leap. It feels scary ""taking the bull by the horns"" per say but I'd rather see my savings account dwindling rather than my soul. Healthcare isn't bad because of the patients or even the job duties.

Quitting is not always the option. You are correct. 

For personal health the rule is : SEA SHEDS

Social networking (NOT FACEBOOK, interact with nonwork friends)

Education (learn what's causing the stress)

Ask for help if you need it.


Schedule (believe it or not, small decisions add stress. It's extra cognitive load. When you can schedule things and create patterns, humans on average report higher levels of satisfaction and positive affect) at the minimum we should aim to: eat , go to sleep, and wake up at the same times every day.

Hobbies (do something non work related, watch things, read, play games, collect things, etc.)

Exercise (this is a MUST. Too many positive outcomes related to exercise)

Diet (eat naturally colorful foods, reds, yellows, greens, purples, etc. FISH OILS OMEGA-3 . And get sunlight and water. You're a plant with more stuff. Drink plenty of water get some sunlight every day.)

Sleep (studies show human beings function optimally with at least 6 hours of sleep, though 8 hours is often preferred. Sleep effects emotions, memory, critical thinking, spatial awareness and more.)

Everytime your boss asks you to stay late, or you take a weekend to finish a project on time, you set the expectation that you will always be that person. Consciously or not, you will take on more or be asked to do more because you've set that bar too high.

If you find yourself wondering how to take your life back, start by resetting expectations. ""I know I've done things like this in the past but if I continue my health will deteriorate."" Or ""I will do what I can to achieve this goal but the timeline is unrealistic."" 

I recognize as well that, like quitting, this tactic may not be an option for some people. High pressure jobs like Air Traffic Controller for example will always be stressful even when the workload is manageable.

guhd6dq,t1_gufx7bu,2021-04-14 12:54:25,science,"I used to think like that. Then my wife had a stroke from work stress when she was 32. I had a seizure from not taking care of myself due to stress about a year later when I was 31. We decided to quit our jobs and downsize our life. We sold our house and removed our $1700/month mortgage and also made a huge chunk on equity. We combined that with our 401Ks and savings and realized we didn‚Äôt have to live for working like we were. We‚Äôve been fortunate financially with buying a house that was going into foreclosure and having major equity in it, and from making a couple of lucky investments. Where we live, people retire with less money than we have saved up, way less. We put an extremely nice double wide mobile home that we paid cash for on some family land outside of town and I sold my vehicle to eliminate payments on it and bought a cheaper car. My wife had an fj cruiser that was paid off, so our only bills are utilities and food.

My wife took a year off and I worked part time for a year. It‚Äôs been the best decision we‚Äôve made. We‚Äôre both completely different people now than we were 6 years ago when we had our health problems from stress. We‚Äôre off all medications and have lost about 50-60 lbs combined. We‚Äôre both perpetually happy people now. 

I went to work designing prototype boats for the last three years. My boss was nice to me but was known to explode on people when he got stressed and that always made stressful times for the company bad for everyone bc they had to walk on eggshells around him. It took three years, but he finally started exploding on me. He did it three times in three pretty stressful weeks. The last time was for something I didn‚Äôt do. He said he couldn‚Äôt yell at the person responsible so he yelled at me and my partner. He started making up flimsy, ridiculous reasons why it might have been our fault then started saying awful things about us to actively attempt to upset us. I left. I felt bad for my partner because she has too many debts to just leave into uncertainty, but I made major decisions and sacrifices earlier in my life so I could leave if things started getting to stressful at work. So I did. 

I‚Äôve been out of work for three weeks and don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll go back. With my wife‚Äôs income now, she teaches English online to people from other countries, I‚Äôm not sure if I will go back. I‚Äôm sure I will get bored after the summer and find something, but I highly, highly recommend doing anything you can to get out of a stressful work environment.

Threats are obstacles to work; challenges are what the name implies.

So, a toxic coworker withholding information you need to do your job or a stack of mandatory busy work that prevents you from completing a more important project would be examples of threat stress.

Challenge stress could be a large project that is either rewarding intrinsically or provides some benefit to future work e.g. overhauling inefficient workflows and processes or building IT infrastructure.

Workplace culture was touched on minimally in the paper, but I‚Äôd take that as the major difference between jobs and types of stress. Some environments range from rewarding or neutral to work hard in. Others make you feel the life being sucked from your veins.",big_bad_brownie,t2_7rl19,6,0,reddit3
gug83c1,t1_gufyoi8,2021-04-14 03:43:33,science,"My first job out of college was low stress once I got settled in - I worked a help desk job at a company that took great care of their salary employees which I was one of. The company network infrastructure was so well locked down that only 7-8 different issues would occur. Once I got the hang of fixing these it was too easy. Have an issue that you can't fix and isn't wide-spread? Just reimage the PC and 45 minutes later they're back to work again. I became very complacent because I never felt stressed, I made great money at 23 compared to my friends outside of work (35k which is a lot to a 23 year old at the time), and we would get a very generous 20% bonus of our salary once a year. If something went south that caused an issue for a large group of users at once, it wasn't my problem to deal with. I just had to tell users to hang tight.

&#x200B;

I eventually left after 4 years because I realized there was no opportunity for upward growth (everyone above me had been there for 10+ years and wasn't leaving any time soon), there was a large age gap where I couldn't relate to anyone, and I realized I wasn't apart of the ""boys club"" after being there for so long. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was that my boss would always give me a great review, and would ask what I wanted to do there long term. No matter what I chose, he would never follow through with getting me involved in any of it like he said he would. He eventually hired a friend from a previous job for a System's Administrator position I had always hoped to be given an opportunity to work up into. Dude sat on his ass for 6 months collecting a paycheck because the government had a serious back log of background checks to do and we couldn't give him access to anything until his was completed.

Short answer: it's complicated. 

Longer answer: the researchers compared studies from different fields and made a model to predict behavioural changes. So there's not really a ""x happened, now people are more y"" situation.

From my understanding, this model still has to be tested 'in the wild'.  But shows promise based on previous literature. 

The changes they predict are based on HPA, serotonin and dopamine, which in turn affect the five factor personality model. This model consists of neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion and openness. Some factors increase under stress, while others decrease.

This part gave me some pause:

>Personality tests can still be used in the hiring process, but Smallfield and Kluemper suggested that they be incorporated throughout the course of an individual's employment to ensure they are still a good fit for the job.

The intent on the surface seems appropriate, but I could easily see this being used as for cause firing of employees. Also, separating the effects of day-to-day stress from job stress seems like it would be a significant variable as they likely may not draw direct correlation to workplace stressors. It seems like a better conclusion than ""good fit for the job"" would instead be ""how they can best support the employee"" (e.g., therapy, adjusted work schedule, etc).",turtle_flu,t2_5ze89,48,0,reddit3

guhe43h,t1_gug3xel,2021-04-14 13:03:03,science,"US is one of the only countries asking 40hrs or more out of their employees.  Then for women, in this country it's like 12-16 weeks for maternity leave, where anywhere else it's typical to be gone a year and men get leave too.  2 weeks vacation is typical here in the US, and elsewhere it's a lot more (20+ days, I believe?)

There is a lot that would have to change structurally to provide any kind of stress reduction. But even a few minor changes can go a long way.

I worked at a company that paid more than the previous and starting off I got something like 26 vacation days and I was floored.  I said, ""there is no way I can use all those vacation days"".  While some rolled over the first year, I finally felt like it was ok for me to take vacation.  If you start off with 2 weeks, it's kind of like you're expected to roll a week over in case something should happen... Meaning you really only get 1 week your first year.

Now two points to address what you said, one: my bill will pay for ONE employee for less than a year. It's not half as easy as saying hire more workers instead of a consultant. I'm the best middle ground between paying everyone less to hire more people, and firing everyone and starting from scratch. Hiring more people also changes MANY factors of the work place meaning it's not just what you are paying that one person, money wise. 

Two: I've gone to companies that just don't care about what I give them. It's like they are just checking it off the list. Their CHRO said we need to fix this, I come in and they IGNORE me.

This user profile has been overwritten in protest of Reddit's decision to disadvantage third-party apps through pricing 
changes. The impact of capitalistic influences on the platforms that once fostered vibrant, inclusive communities has 
been devastating, and it appears that Reddit is the latest casualty of this ongoing trend. 

This account, 10 years, 3 months, and 4 days old, has contributed 901 
times, amounting to over 48424 words. In response, the community has awarded it more than 10652

I am saddened to leave this community that has been a significant part of my adult life. However, my departure is driven

Then, they're forced to work nearly full time hours, with the company clocking them 1 hour short of where the government would step in and make them get hired as full time. 

And when OT o'clock rolls around, instead of getting OT (even if they were heavily shorted hours for the week due to a schedule error), the company would just called in some other part timers who where shy of their 35 or whatever hours and didn't have the 7.5 hours that particular day, and forced them to work an on-call shift.

As for the others: you probably feel it's easy to identify a bad manager and sack them but often it's just an untrained one and thus might be in better interest to train them. But managers account for a VERY small amount of work stress so thats not a real solution on it's own. Unrealistic expectations. That's due to the lack of an RJP and too large of a power distance as well as other factors, but again: not actually a big factor when looking at the data. 

No, it's a matter of onboarding, training and alignment for both management AND employees. 

But the reason I have job security is there not one method to fix everything and it takes a thorough analysis to identify a specific companies issues. 

Largely though, strain is more on the perception of a stressor than the actual stressor it's self. (moderators are too many to list but just recognise something can be a stressor one day but not the next)",danethegreat24,t2_zfmuu,2,0,reddit3
gugcvnb,t1_gugax0i,2021-04-14 04:35:39,science,"So yes if wanted to go deeper we would look at the stressor and work life balance analysis I mentioned at the end there. Though I'll make a point now that employees have to ""buy into"" company culture as well. 

But I see your point. The other side of what I do as a consultant is address toxic/ malformed culture. It has to start at the top though. Leadership teams need to be clear on what they want from their companies and thus what they need from their employees. This often means that they need to define, in their charter, what their ""fit"" image is. From there it's clarity of message and expectations being passed down. BUT the org culture needs to be open to hearing what the employees are saying back. Then we disect what the jobs really are and what the tasks associated with those jobs are. We find out if people are doing more than one job. If they are, we split the tasks. We list a new opening. Then we manage the expectations with resources. Unfortunately resources are harder to change than expectations so guess what we usually change? We base resource analysis off of a utility analysis of current and potential resource sets. 

At this point I'm a bit tired of typing on my phone haha but you get the point. Realistic expectations are two way street, good management needs good employees and work life balance is also not in a vacuum. The root of the problem is the image and culture cultivated but there are dozens of factors that play into those things from norms to industry.",danethegreat24,t2_zfmuu,3,0,reddit3
guhdxi9,t1_gugax0i,2021-04-14 13:01:20,science,"I have worked (early career) in a company where they needed warm bodies more than anything.  The job consisted of one of three things depending on the day.

- play a game (sometimes a crappy one) 8 hours and write down if it crashed, you got stuck 

- insert discs into a console and launch the game, playing it for 20-30 minutes before repeating on a different level.

- pressing the power button and timing how long it took to load (hope was to get about 60 loads an hour, expected rate for people doing this was 20.)

Those were the three possible expectations for a day.  People Still felt it was too stressful to handle and wanted longer paid breaks (we had 15 every 1 hour 45 minutes), longer long lunch breaks (30 minutes so short), more pay (it was about 8.50-9.80 an hour for this job in early 2000s)

There were no people yelling at you.   No high demands for performance.  No expectations for work outside the standard hours. No real stress for an average person.  And yet, there were stressed people from that job.

Sure, the company didn't provide free food.  We didn't know which games we would play before we got in.  There wasn't an expectation of growth inside the company (they told you this when you joined).  The worst part of it was probably the Lack of expectations on the people working.

hry2jve,t3_rzy3b9,2022-01-09 18:34:47,science,"In contrast to common perceptions, plastic is in no way near one material. Rather, it is a combination of many materials (polymers) with different chemical compounds and additives such as pigments or fibres, depending on its use. It is very difficult to tell the difference between different types of plastics, and this is what makes it difficult to separate and recycle them.

In collaboration with Vestforbr√¶nding, Dansk Affaldsminimering Aps, and PLASTIX, researchers from the Department of Biological and Chemical Engineering at Aarhus University have now developed a new camera technology that can see the difference between 12 different types of plastics (PE, PP, PET, PS, PVC, PVDF, POM, PEEK, ABS, PMMA, PC, and PA12). Together, these constitute the vast majority of household plastic types.

The technology makes it possible to separate plastics based on a purer chemical composition than is possible today, and this opens up for completely new opportunities to recycle plastics. The technology has been tested at pilot scale and is planned to be implemented at PLASTIX and Dansk Affaldsminimering Aps in spring 2022.

""With this technology, we can now see the difference between all types of consumer plastics and several high-performance plastics. We can even see the difference between plastics that consist of the same chemical building blocks, but which are structured slightly differently. We use a hyperspectral camera in the infrared area, and machine learning to analyse and categorise the type of plastic directly on the conveyor belt. The plastic can then be separated into different types. It's a breakthrough that will have a huge impact on all plastics separation,"" says Associate Professor Mogens Hinge, who is heading the project at Aarhus University.

Teflon is a type of coating made primarily from PFAS. PFAS is a catch all for Poly/Perfluoro alkyl substances and there's a huge amount of different chemicals that fall in to this category. Teflon can be applied to a variety of materials, including plastics. PFAS are in an even greater amount of products, basically anything that's got any waterproofing properties has PFAS.  Firefighting foams used to be made of PFAS. PFAS are in pretty much everything because they are used widely and because they do not biodegrade or decompose and they are highly mobile in soil and ground water. They also bioaccumulate. That being said, most PFAS in the environment is found in low levels and it is not clear what the effects on humans and the environment are. High levels tend to occur mostly where these chemicals are manufactured or where used in industrial fire fighting systems/professional fire fighting (i.e. airports, defence air bases, fire stations, fire training grounds). Another place they're found is in waste water treatment plants, this is because waste water treatment concentrates PFAS. (so the plants recieve water from industrial areas that use PFAS and all the PFAS get concentrated in the effluent and biosolids.)

Note that the article shows a wage gap of 20%, but a total compensation gap of only 10% - there are several states in the graphs with wage gaps of less than 10%, which would imply that total compensation in those states for teachers may be higher than for non education professions, even stipulating that the professions are comparable. 

The comparison with total compensation isn‚Äôt clear on whether they adjust for the difference between pensions and 401k style retirement plans - since pension costs for an employee are backloaded vs 401k costs for an employee are realized for that employee in the same year he receives salary.

IQ tests are good at measuring ""intelligence"" defined in such a way that doing well on an IQ test means you have high intelligence. It's a very narrow definition of intelligence. Note the following from this [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6927908/#ref53) 

""Related evidence suggests that IQ scores are inconsistent at predicting variation in performance (including the extremities) on activities such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making (Stanovich, 2009; Fletcher et al., 2018)."" 

""However, their real-world interpretations inflate them to represent overall mental functioning across wide-ranging domains, from education achievement to job performance and interpersonal relationships (Sternberg et al., 2001). This inflation is evident from the contradictions observed in the evidence on the predictive value of the IQ tests. Related research suggests a weak to moderate correlation between performance on IQ tests and outcomes on education, job performance, income levels, and overall individual well-being (Bowles and Gintis, 2002; Strenze, 2007). Other factors, such as parent‚Äôs socio-economic status (Strenze, 2007), have been shown to moderate these correlations actively. Overall, the evidence points to an interpretive gap between what the IQ tests are believed to measure and what they do.""

""However, a recent meta-analytic review of motivational influences on cognitive performance suggests that dispositional traits account for less considerable variation when compared to shifts in motivational states (Van Iddekinge et al., 2018). In a seminal study, Duckworth et al. (2011) present evidence on how state changes in test taker‚Äôs motivations significantly predict performance on the IQ tests. The research also suggests that the predictive validity of the IQ scores for various life outcomes substantially diminishes with the shifts in motivational levels of the test taker.

""Growing evidence suggests that motivations energize and guide the cognitive performance of a typical test taker (Duckworth et al., 2011). Relatedly, the dispositional theory of intelligence (Perkins et al., 1993) predicts that trait motivations drive much of the variation in performance on the IQ tests. Likewise, research suggests that traits such as growth mindset, openness to experience, and need for cognition modulate the willingness to search and process information that, in turn, influences an individual‚Äôs performance on an IQ test (Dweck, 2006; Woods et al., 2019).

Feedback on performance and subsequent affective states influence the cognitive functioning of the test taker. Mainly, the negative affective states like task anxiety have been found to lower the performance on the IQ tests substantially (von der Embse et al., 2018). To sum up, sparse but significant evidence on motivational and affective processes suggests that they account for substantial variation in performance on the IQ tests.""

People with lower income might perform worse on IQ tests because of these factors and not because people born into low-income are somehow born less intelligent.

This other [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3950413/) discusses how you can improve your score, but it doesn't actually mean you improved your intelligence.

Similarly, there have been many studies about how SAT scores are skewed for income, but you didn't know that either and are trying to say it measures intelligence too, just because SAT and IQ scores happen to be correlated. You are mixing up correlation between two tests that can both be improved upon by simply spending money.

Why is the skill rarer? Maybe because complex jobs require a level of intelligence that is rare in society? I mean, it's almost like the rarity of those skills are directly correlated to the high end of the IQ distribution in society...

The more complex a work task, the greater the advantages that higher g confers in performing it well.** Everyday tasks, like job duties, also differ in their level of complexity. The importance of intelligence therefore differs systematically across different arenas of social life as well as economic endeavor. Data from the National Adult Literacy Survey are used to show how higher levels of cognitive ability systematically improve individual's odds of dealing successfully with the ordinary demands of modern life (such as banking, using maps and transportation schedules, reading and understanding forms, interpreting news articles). These and other data are summarized to illustrate how the advantages of higher g, even when they are small, cumulate to affect the overall life chances of individuals at different ranges of the IQ bell curve.

d0i0h8y,t3_489xei,2016-02-29 13:44:44,science,"Hi, and thank you for taking to time to discuss this.  I lived in rural Alaska a while back, in a small fishing village where my wife taught and I did many jobs, including commercial fishing.  This was when the fight against Pebble Mine was still being actively fought in the local communities, and I had many chances to visit the potentially affected villages in and around Lake Illiamna and Bristol Bay.  

I also recently read American Catch by Adam Greenberg and learned about the plights of New York oysters and Gulf shrimp.  Additionally, I grew up on Lake Erie, which 100 years ago had a thriving fishery for Blue Fish and Sturgeon, both of which are all but extinct in the area.  

Suffice to say that I have an interest in sustainable fisheries, but my first introduction to the topic was through a mathematics course in biological models, learning about the various models used and how a specific model (Beverton-Holt maybe?) was developed by looking at the effect that the cessation of large-scale fishing in the Mediterranean due to WW2 had on population sizes - I have been fascinated ever since.

So my question: What is the current state of fisheries modelling, and how is it used on a day-to-day basis to try to create sustainable fisheries?  Are the models more deterministic or stochastic in nature?  How is data collected, is it reported counts, direct observation, hatchery data, etc?  An specifically regarding bycatch, how is this incorporated into any decision making?

I guess my primary question is how I would go about working in fisheries management, given that I don't have degrees in the area?  (Math/Engineering BS/MS, but no bio sciences)  I genuinely feel that I would look forward to going to work everyday if I were a part of helping to create and maintain sustainable fisheries.",misterthirsty,t2_5enf3,22,0,reddit4

We love our fish in Hawaii! We consume a 9oz/person/week, twice the national average, and import fish far less than other states. (http://www.fpir.noaa.gov/SFD/pdfs/seafood/EI-22.pdf; http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/how-fish-get-from-the-sea-to-your-plate/)
We especially love our Ahi or Bigeye tuna! 



Over the last 10 years we have increasingly been seeing reports of over fishing in our Hawaiian waters that we have been told are affecting our fisheries terribly, to the point of no return. In recent years the Bigeye limit for local fishermen has been doubled through a new ruling that lets fishermen attribute their Hawaiian catch to US territories in the Pacific like Guam. Many of us are concerned that this further contributes to over fishing. Local fishermen who rely on their catch to feed their families say they follow the rules but say ""Our local guys - because of this State Department policy - were getting squeezed. And every time they turned their boat around they were watching the Taiwanese come in and just scoop fish right from out under them.‚Äù (http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/5/inouye-influenced-rule-enables-extra-hawaii-tuna-f/?page=all) 



Fishermen have taken to trespassing and fishing off of Ni'ihau or ""The Forbidden Island"" since fisheries in that area are relatively untouched compared to the rest of the state (Hawaiians live here traditionally without modern conveniences like roads, stores, and internet. They rely on the fishing and a little farming to feed their population.).  Similar to other places in the world, Ni'ihau does not have any regulation on fishing. 



I understand the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) was created to address these types of issues. They have implemented rulings to prevent bycatch, including bycatch by longliners and purse seiners targeting tuna, and bycatch of juvenile tuna. However from what I understand, there doesn't seem to be any consequence for not following these rulings. I'm under the impression that reported numbers can be intentionally misrepresented. Still today large scale commercial boats such as the Albatun Tres operate catching **thousands** of tonnes of tuna per fishing trip. 



Beyond this is anything being done to stop the depletion of fisheries in regulated and unregulated areas in the world if anything? In your opinion can anything further be done to ensure compliance? Do you think the efforts currently in place are having more of positive effect globally? or do you think we as a global society are still on a dangerous course if efforts are not increased?

Regulation there is so on point that the returns on pink salmon have gotten better what seems exponentially if viewed in a two year cycle (normal humpy fish breeding cycle).

The predictions have been super on point too, so a lot of people are saying they probably got scooped up by offshore trawlers or ""draggers"", what do you the chances of that are?
I have a friend that used to fish on our boat and now is a dragger and he said they catch all kinds of stuff they're not supposed to but it's hard to regulate on them because they provide something like 1/3 of the market share of seafood.

Excuse my Reddit knowledge/ grammar.

A slightly unknown to the outside fishery world, but well known to the IPHC (International Pacific Halibut Commission),  what is the main motivation to keep dragging vessels in service while they are our main source of by catch on the halibut population. When we are so close to a comeback of the fishery from their record low around 2010. Source (blue line survey)

Also. Although a majority of halibut reside/migrate in area 3A Alaska (kodiak,Cook Inlet, Montague) Has any data supported the action taken of removing dragging vessels from Canadian waters? Being a federally regulated fish I assume some international collaboration has been spoken outside of the IPHC on this move.


Final question and separate from Halibut,

The recent supreme court case has been shot down on this subject but the set nets that are used to harvest salmon returning to the river's of Cook Inlet ( Kenai, Kasilof, Anchor, Deep Creek etc...) 

What is NOAA's involvement of study on this fishery. Although not bycatch, the harvest of nearly 10,000 king salmon when escapement was barely met at 20,000.  I feel this is playing to closely with the future of the species, as well as future commercial, Charter, eco tourism futures of the state.

The problem has been stated that the sample trawling process (towing a tiny net for a short period of time in varying conditions year-over-year) is hardly indicative of reality as the numbers being extrapolated are not statistically significant.  
  
Ironically, I got a Computer Science degree and, working with the commercial fishermen of the Northeast, created software to use fishing vessels as data collectors for detailed information. Applying for a S-K and other grants was a real eye-opener for us. We were treated with thinly veiled disdain by the researchers at Wood's Hole and they ended up funding a European consulting group with strong lobbying ties in Washington to create the very software we had already built. They gave them over ten times the amount of money we had requested in our denied application and, as far as I know, the dutch company never deployed any software.

Here's the [software page from 2002 with screenshots](http://contour.sourceforge.net/).

So my question is, are researchers making any attempt at working with fishermen for data collection these days?

Note: to be fair, in a couple of contracts on factory trawlers in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea, the NMFS observer program seemed to be effective. The problems I saw were largely confined to the NorthEast (George's Bank and the Gulf of Maine) and really centered in Wood's Hole.",minutesir,t2_huexc,0,0,reddit4

Part of the issue is getting state governments and fishermen, together, to comply with the federal regulation.  A good example is the red snapper debacle in the South East.  But, with respect to bycatch, research on best management practices is the only true weapon fisheries folks have to reduce bycatch.

In the shrimping industry, one of my favorite creations is the turtle excluder device (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_excluder_device).  It has reduced turtle mortality from shrimp trawling and is a relatively simple little device, but the problem is getting fishermen to install these on their equipment: who's going to pay for them?  Also, the device is not wholly efficient.  Big animals still get stuck, and they can ironically get trapped by the excluder.  Also, it does interfere with the fishermen's catch.

By catch will always be an issue with fishing.  If you take a rod and reel and go for bass, you'll catch other sunfish and most likely a catfish.  That's just the nature of fishing.  But, on commercial scales: the goal is catching enough fish to not harm the stock while simultaneously reducing the impact (indirectly and directly) on the other stocks.

If you want to know what fisheries are sustainable, go to FAO.org and look up in the fisheries section the species of interest.  There will be a lot of information with regards to landings and ecology that may interest you.

The best way to know that fish are caught properly is usually by how they look.  Net-caught fish never look as nice as Hook & Line.  For instance, a tuna caught in a net is more likely to cook its own meat from the inside because their body heats up as they fight.  This will result in a darker flesh and a bloodline that is funky.

The vast majority of seafood is imported into the US.  There are regulations to increase the traceability from catch to consumer planned for the future.  

Part of the problem is that most fish that you buy in a supermarket is prepared/cut in a way that doesn't allow the consumer to know exactly what they are eating.

I can answer this one for you. Massively overexagerated. The claim first came from a paper by Worm *et al.* in 2006 (Impacts of biodiversity loss on ocean ecosystem services). It contained the statement that given current rates of fishery collapses, all fish stocks would have collapsed by 2048. It didn't take into account recovery, just the number of stocks there are, and the average rates at which they enter the ""collapse zone"" of the phase plot. It wasn't a major part of their paper, which focussed on the costs of biodiversity loss, but the statement was in their press release, the media ran with it, and the authors, happy to bask in the adulation, did nothing to correct any misconceptions. As a result, I believe its one of the most thoroughly challenged pieces in modern fisheries literature - [this](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Henrik_Gislason/publication/273028507_Apocalypse_in_world_fisheries_The_reports_of_their_death_are_greatly_exaggerated/links/55263df00cf24b822b407972.pdf) is probably the most comprehensive.

Some fish stocks are doing better than others for various reasons, including warming waters that may be causing fish populations to move away from traditional fishing grounds, but overall, U.S. fisheries are among the best-managed fisheries in the world.

One example of a tool is descending devices for recreational anglers. Check it out here:

These gear are often left to soak overnight or longer and the species caught in these gear are often struggling a lot in there and die due to the stress of being captured.  Nets are often used for schooling pelagic species

In active gears like nets, again stress plays a roll, but many times the fish caught in the nets die before the fishermen can get to them.

It's been shown that small particles of plastic can enter fish's bloodstream, which is how we can get plastic into our systems after eating them. But on top of that another huge issue, especially in freshwater systems, is the oils/PCB/other chemicals that are hydrophobic that bind with plastics. These allow the plastics to sink further into the water column and be available as food to more fish. Then, not only are they consuming the plastic, they're getting chemicals into their system as well.

I'm from the Hudson Valley, and this is why you cannot eat adult eels in our area is due to the level of PCBs in their system (due to an old GE plant). 

These effects will only be augmented with the increase in plastic. Benthic chemicals- such as PCBs- can exist higher in the water column, and plastics can fall lower. (This is a theory of mine and idk if it's been studied).",gingerbreadfuck,t2_dn3dn,2,0,reddit4

Ocean aquaculture can lead to bycatch depending on the type of equipment used. All aquaculture in Federal waters goes through a rigorous permitting process before it can operate. The risk of bycatch is examined in that process and monitoring and mitigation measures may be required.

I'm currently at a marine science station studying fisheries management and in response to your question (adding on to what OP's answer), a term you should be aware of and that you'll definitely hear about is ecosystem-based management (EBM). Historical fisheries management that used MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield) as a standard metric took only into account birth, growth, and mortality of a fish stock, where EBM accounts for environmental factors, life cycles, relationships between species and overall impact on ecosystems, giving a better idea of the overall human impact and sustainability of not only the stock but the surrounding ecosystem. EBM is standard in modern fisheries science and the reason US fisheries are so well managed (the CA MPA system is a great example).

I haven't done much modeling but to address some of your questions, by this general ethos I would imagine they are more stochastic, which is much more realistic given the enormous variability of all factors involved, including the integrity of data that can be collected. That's not meant to be a dig at anyone but just that it's really hard to collect good data on catch and stock sizes, especially with pelagics (fish that swim in the open ocean) - and then you can throw in dishonest fishermen and illegal operations and it's really just the best scientists can do.

There‚Äôs also a nice overview as part of our ABC‚Äôs of stock assessments.
[http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/stories/2013/03/3_04_13catching_up_with_catch_shares.html]

In general, human fisheries observers are our best method to monitor bycatch and identify situations where bycatch needs to be reduced.  

These are trained scientists who carefully record bycatch levels and take biological samples that assist our agency scientists with their fish stock assessments. 

Observers are also highly trained in fishing vessel safety and have been known to make the difference when an emergency happens on a fishing vessel.  

The data the observers provide on all species, such as target fish as well as non-target species like sea turtles, sawfish,etc, inform managers efforts to address bycatch. For instance, marine mammal interactions inform marine mammal take reduction team recommendations, and observer data on salmon bycatch are used by the fishing industry for innovative bycatch avoidance programs in Alaska.  

Sometimes it‚Äôs not possible to put an observer on a boat due to space limitations or other factors. In that case, we‚Äôve got to get creative. Right now, we‚Äôre focusing a lot on technology. In some fisheries, we‚Äôre experimenting with using cameras on board, which can help us spot and count bycatch. 

This is a really exciting arena for us. Here are a couple of good stories about both the promise and challenge of these technologies:

We look at all available tools when determining what is the best approach for that fishery.
With respect to the ‚Äúzones,‚Äù, I think your question is related to the concept of catch shares, or individual fishing quotas, which have been implemented by NOAA and our management partners over the decade.  Catch shares allocate rights to harvest part of a quota to a fleet or individual boat, which can allow boats to fish more according to their own schedules and more carefully, which in turn can lead to reduced bycatch.  This website has more information about catch share fisheries:

Even vegans use fish for purposes other than food (and yes they do use many animal products without eating them).  So, the net has to be employed, particularly in the pelagic species.  

Research on what species associate with the catch of the day is critical because it allows us to detail certain methods towards reducing the opportunity of collecting those animals accidentally.  So, part of the innovations will be a mix of engineering and marketing.  Fishermen are all for protecting their livlihoods so long as in the short term it doesn't put them out of business (if they can't even make money to cover the costs, they may not be able to recover funds to go out next season and break even).",feedmahfish,t2_6g43u,-1,0,reddit4
d0ilam5,t1_d0i1cdf,2016-02-29 22:08:06,science,"Environmental student, I can give a quick answer.

In theory, everyone becoming vegetarian would be beneficial to the environment, but in the real world it isn't that simple. 

It would be beneficial because all the energy needed to grow that animal would now be fed to humans. And more then half of the currently grown crops in the US are used to feed livestock. 

Each ecosystem has a series of trophic levels, basically a food chain, with the highest trophic level  often being the biggest scariest predator, the lowest being the smallest, most insignificant creature or plant. 

Think if it as a business transfer with multiple middle men, you being the highest trophic level, and the supplier being the lowest. The supplier takes the raw material and makes your product. And hands it off to the first middle man, who in this case takes some of the product, and then passes it onto the next middle man. This process continues until it reaches you at the top. Unfortunately all the middle men have taken a portion of the product, meaning you need to buy significantly more to attain the amount you original wanted. Unfortunately if these middle men didn't exist, your product would never arrive.

This is how ecosystems work, humans on the top only eat the big animals, which needed to eat the smaller animals or plants, while also needing to take a portion of the energy to stay alive, say 90%. 

It can cause issues though, as eating a large amount of one level can destroy a food chain, it has started happening with fisheries, which is labeled ""fishing down trophic levels"".

If everyone went vegetarian, a lot of this energy that is ""lost"" when raising livestock or other animals for food would no longer be lost,  instead going directly into the human, essentially cutting out a huge amount of inefficiency in relation to energy gained by eating meat over plants.

Over the years, we‚Äôve worked with fishermen and scientists to come up with creative solutions to avoid or minimize bycatch. A lot of times this involves studying the behavior of animals around fishing gear and then modifying the gear so that the unwanted animals avoid the gear or are not kept if they interact with the gear.  

We always manage our fish populations to ensure that there are enough fish in the ecosystem for continued healthy populations.  

Some of the solutions I think are the most interesting include: 
turtle excluder devices:

No fisherman wants to encounter bycatch because they don‚Äôt want the wrong fish to eat their bait, and because it takes a lot of time for fishermen to sort through the bycatch on deck. In addition, fishermen don‚Äôt want to catch protected species, like marine mammals, sea turtles and seabirds. In general, some types of gear are more selective than others. For example, pots and traps generally are more selective than longlines, which generally are more selective than trawls. Fishermen and scientists have been working for decades to make trawls more selective through turtle excluder devices and fish bycatch reduction devices in Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic shrimp trawl fisheries (see [http://www.sefsc.noaa.gov/labs/mississippi/brd/]) and salmon excluder devices for West Coast and Alaska trawl fisheries [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqfCzfC2joM].

d0ihkk7,t1_d0i184e,2016-02-29 20:45:09,science,"OK, I'm going to offer a completely different approach to getting your foot in the door - an approach that will give you tons of first-hand experience - far more than most of your contemporaries - as well as a decent income, the chance to see some very cool places and meet interesting people, and stories for days. 

Become a fisheries observer. 

Basically, an observer is someone who works on commercial fishing boats as a contract biologist. Your jobs is to collect data from the catches - species ID, weights, biological samples, etc. You live alongside the fishermen while at sea - they catch the fish, you collect the data. 

You get to see an incredible array of marine life - not only the fish and inverts that are caught (which is interesting to anyone with a biology background), but also the sea birds and marine mammals that you'll see while off at sea (and you see a ton). You also get to experience the realities of fishing first-hand - rather than merely reading about it, you'll experience it. The weather, the foul-ups, the challenges.

It's an interesting life - you're very independent, as you are your own boss while at sea. You don't answer to the crew, and you're generally on your own (sometimes there's another observer with you, but most often not). You move from boat to boat, port to port. Depending on where you are (Alaska, west coast, Hawaii, New England, etc.), you may be at sea for less than one day at a time, 5 days, 10 days, or even up to and beyond 30 days.

The pay is very good, considering that it's generally considered to be an entry-level job. I don't know what they pay now, but back when I was doing it in Alaska a decade ago, you'd come home from a 90 day contract with about $12,000 or something (I can't quite recall the exact amount). 

And, when the time comes where you decide to apply to grad school or look for fisheries-related employment on dry land, you'll have an enormous advantage over people whose experience is solely from behind computers or on research cruises. Employers and graduate schools love people with hands-on experience. Plus, the experience will continue to benefit you in your research and/or work, because you'll have a decent understanding of how fisheries actually operate on the water - a perspective that is often lacking in academia.

Anyway, if you're semi-adventurous and truly want to get into a fisheries or marine conservation-related field, this is what I would suggest. I did it, and it boosted me from being a nobody into a pretty cool trajectory that I'm still riding. 

If you're interested, there are a bunch of observer companies out there - Alaska Observers and Saltwater Inc. are two that come to mind.

The main issue is the limit of the EEZ and where the snapper spawn.

Thus there were very stringent measures put in place for a while on red snapper in LA until they realized there was a healthy stock outside the LA EEZ (and also that MS, AL, and FL were having good snapper runs).  So this kicked off a big discussion.

I believe that the cod fishery was shut down after the population collapsed and fishing has been prohibited or very limited for 20+ years now, but the problem with recovery is that the ecosystem has changed.

In the previous cod-dominated regime, cod were the apex predator and fed on small pelagic fish and invertebrates. After they were essentially fished out, they were not extinct but very rare. This caused a 'trophic cascade' effect where the removal of predation pressure allowed for the prey populations to grow, so that the area is now dominated by small pelagics and invertebrates. This actually has given rise to a shrimp/crab fishery that is equally if not more lucrative than the previous cod fishery (my information might be a little dated so feel free to correct me). Additionally, seals that previously competed with cod and went elsewhere for their prey really reaped the benefits of the fishery collapse and boom of prey species, and have grown exponentially in number, establishing themselves as the new apex predator. So essentially the ecosystem is reaching/has reached an 'alternate stable state' dominated by invertebrates with fewer cod and more seals.

Some pingers are designed to alert animals to the presence of fishing gear, while other pingers are designed to deter animals from the gear (e.g., acoustic harassment devices). Some pingers have been shown to be very effective in keeping some species such as harbor porpoise out of gillnets, and have been required as part of bycatch reduction regulations (such as the Harbor Porpoise Take Reduction Plan, [http://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/protected/porptrp/], and the Pacific Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Plan, [http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/interactions/trt/poctrp.html]). For other species, such as some dolphins and seals, pingers have been found in some cases to act as a ‚Äúdinner bell,‚Äù drawing animals to the gear. 

There are a wide variety of pingers on the market, with different acoustic properties. The amount of maintenance, such as replacing batteries, may vary depending on how often the pingers are pinging, how long they‚Äôre in the water, how many are used per fishing trip, etc. In cases where we require pingers to be used, we work with fishermen to consider operational issues.

Fish, for many smaller and general coastal towns isn't only a source of income, it's their only method of survival - various coastal towns off Africa or China for example are fantastic examples - They're low income towns which an individual makes ~80 dollars month give or take - but then part of their catch is used to also feed the family. To my knowledge a lot of these towns have recently been struggling due to fish population impacts and their potentially (yet to be proven) adaptive change of home ranges. Understanding ecological limits is paramount in this battle - even the basics of knowing the sexual maturity of k and r based species may be enough to maintain stocks - this also includes factors such as understanding what oceanographic changes can impact gene selection and clutch sizes; these become imperative in our understanding of maintaining animal ecology. But general management of human behaviour seems to umbrella all of the things I mentioned. As an example - something that doesn't come up a lot but is a major issue is the by catch caused by ghost nets/ fishing gear - gear that has broken off, or been cut loose due to a snag or entanglement which gets dumped into the water column and thus has been left to float through the water decimating larger populations of fish with no real positives outcomes.

And if you mean ""species population is approximately the same as its pre-industrial level"" that is another.

One definition is relative to extinction, one is relative to fisheries catch, and one is relative to historical conditions. And these are just three - there are many other ways to define sustainability too.

Which is correct?

It matters which definition we adopt because they are not necessarily compatible, either within one species or across ecosystems. Is it ""sustainable"", for example, to radically disrupt an ecosystem as long as none of the commercial catch species don't go extinct?

So while /u/NOAAgov is correct that fears of immanent collapse/extinction for commercial species may be unfounded, it is not at all an exaggeration to say that the world's marine ecosystems have been completely decimated by commercial fisheries.

I'm not a fisherman, and if I had to pick I'd pick the fish every time, but what my question is about is whether or not there is some fishery gerrymandering going on, which I think would be wrong. Let me further clarify that the people I'm talking about are rod fisherman, not trawlers (which I think is wrong for plenty of other reasons than overfishing, though that's also a major issue with trawling).

d0i7a4o,t1_d0i61rx,2016-02-29 16:54:15,science,"The farming issue comes from foreign producers mostly; the farmers are converting sensitive mangrove stands into shrimp farms.  Our domestic aquaculture production of shrimp is in ponds away from mangrove marshes.  But all farms have issues with waste from the culture stock, so how they deal with it is an ongoing area of research which has been quite successful (in corporation of hydroponic crops with aquaculture for example).  Shrimp farming domestically is far more expensive than internationally, so many farm raised shrimp available are foreign produced.  Also an FCR (feed conversion ratio) of 1.3 to 1 is a farmer's dream.  Many times the FCR is above 2.5 and higher.  So thats actually a good thing.

From the wild harvest aspect, the damage due to trawling is actually the benthic and demersal life.  Trawls scour the bottom and produce large rifts where they are dragged.  There has been research on improving the trawl design, but because the bottom of the trawl (which is in contact with the bottom and prone to snagging) must resist damage, the design hasn't yet been perfected to minimize bottom habitat destruction.  I know there have been studies looking at recovery after trawling, but I am not on a computer right now.",feedmahfish,t2_6g43u,11,0,reddit4

Thus you can imagine that the dynamics of a stock are different among localities.  

With respect to snapper, its a question of spawning stock and recruitment (how many adults are spawning and how many juvenile survive to spawning) and this does differ depending on the existing conditions of the locality.  Thus the models are adjusted to account for these differences to give the recommendations.  

You can fish for gulf red snapper, but the restrictions follow the biology and the spawning habits of the species which seem to be general among snapper stock (no one stock is special).  Thus, what is the rule in one area may be different in others to an extent (usually in season, size or slot size, or in creel limit).  However, in almost every creel limit/season calculation, it is because of anticipated fishing effort and spawning dynamics together that result in the limits.

He's the kind of environmentalist that want to tear down the whole system and replace it with his panacea. Regardless of what he propose, it'll work about as well as the current system because there are many many issues that are hidden to us because of the lack of scale. Unless he specifically offered solutions along the line of reaching out to farmers and working with them to reduce their impacts while making a equitable salary, then it's not going to work. 

At this point, there aren't that many people who's completely unaware of the issue. Documentaries like this one are for **entertainment**, not to inform farmers about their unintended consequences.

Regulations like that are developed by regional fishery management councils and NOAA to respond to specific management concerns, like wanting to discourage targeting on particular types of fish.  We are trying to identify best practices and gear modifications that can reduce the mortality of fish that have to be discarded.  A lot of these are fish-specific. And there‚Äôs evolving research about what works best.  One best practice seems to be the use of descending devices, which help fish suffering from barotrauma get back down to deep water quickly so that their internal organs can re-pressurize.  However, more research needs to be done to see how various fish respond to these devices.  NOAA Fisheries has supported the development of the FishSmart website, which provides a lot of information about best practices to reduce recreational release mortality:
[http://www.fishsmart.org/bestpractices]

Also, in general, exposure to air has a big effect on fish survival.  The more exposure, the more likely the fish is to die.  For the past few years, fishermen in Alaska have used a special permit from NOAA Fisheries to investigate new sorting practices on the decks of fishing vessels in order to reduce the mortality of halibut bycatch.

But also did weird crash diets revolving around protein & fat or starved any time he thought the number on the scale was too high after holidays or school breaks. Bc it wasn't carbs, he thought he could eat as much as he wanted. Went home for the spring break one year and his parents couldn't wake him up one morning. He was in a diabetic coma, and his pancreas is completely screwed up for life. He'd been crazy thirsty, peeing all the time, sleeping a lot the first few days he was home. He'd been like that the week before too, but hadn't said anything to anyone. He didn't come back to work for around a month and he looked like death when he did come back.

>However, vegans and vegetarians were associated with the highest abundance of genes responsible for flagellar assembly, chemotaxis and two-component systems. Vegans and vegetarians also harbored functional potential, related to carbohydrate, amino acid, cofactor and vitamin metabolisms. 
>... These findings, along with boosted chemotaxis functions, indicated that microbiomes of individuals with plant-based diet, which is rich of non-digestible carbohydrates, might had developed strategies to get physical access to nutrients. Overall, flagella correlated with cell adhesion and biofilm formation, and represented virulence factors that increase the host immune response.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6478664/

>A plant-based diet appears to be beneficial for human health by promoting the development of more diverse and stable microbial systems. Additionally, vegans and vegetarians have significantly higher counts of certain Bacteroidetes-related operational taxonomic units compared to omnivores. Fibers (that is, non-digestible carbohydrates, found exclusively in plants) most consistently increase lactic acid bacteria, such as Ruminococcus, E. rectale, and Roseburia, and reduce Clostridium and Enterococcus species. Polyphenols, also abundant in plant foods, increase Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, which provide anti-pathogenic and anti-inflammatory effects and cardiovascular protection. High fiber intake also encourages the growth of species that ferment fiber into metabolites as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. The positive health effects of SCFAs are myriad, including improved immunity against pathogens, blood‚Äìbrain barrier integrity, provision of energy substrates, and regulation of critical functions of the intestine.

>Ketogenic diets reduce seizure frequency in some individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy. These diets can also reduce body weight, although not more effectively than other dietary approaches over the long term or when matched for energy intake. Ketogenic diets can also lower blood glucose, although their efficacy typically wanes within the first few months.

Very-low-carbohydrate diets are associated with marked risks. LDL-C can rise, sometimes dramatically. Pregnant women on such diets are more likely to have a child with a neural tube defect, even when supplementing folic acid. And these diets may increase chronic disease risk: Foods and dietary components that typically increase on ketogenic diets (eg, red meat, processed meat, saturated fat) are linked to an increased risk of CKD, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease, whereas intake of protective foods (eg, vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains) typically decreases.

* while the evolutionary theory seems plausible it has not yet been definitively proven nor are we able to accurately quantize the effect. We do however know that exposure to gender roles during childhood and adolescence has a big impact on our preferences.
* we lack a decent control group. While there are couples who deviate from the traditional gender roles, they do so in defiance of societal expectations and are not a representative subset of the general population.

But even if we take this study at face value, I still think that reducing the gender care gap is a worthwhile political goal.

gpilvmn,t3_lwh1eo,2021-03-03 09:08:54,science,"Psychology graduate here: that‚Äòs not a fact nor science but just a simple result of generational teaching and pressure from society. The only valid timeframe for this theory is when woman is pregnant, gives birth or stays home to take care of the child (just like the picture given in the post). As the mother like in nature do not want to abandon her children, she tends to stay home for protection and meanwhile help with the housework while father works and brings in food. Due to this tendency, throughout the generations the society (of men) has generalized this time period for the entire life of a woman and assigned such a maid role to them while men freed themselves from housework and enjoyed their daily routine outside. Coming to the maintenance and outside work (garden, garage), this is also another typical gender role assignment given by the society using the excuse that these tasks require more strength so that men should do them. This is particularly true as due to testosterone hormone men‚Äòs muscular structure is overall a few times stronger than a women‚Äòs. However, as the living standards are improving, these perspectives are becoming an old-dated assumptions of the past. In the past, a man should have learned these maintenance and heavy work tasks from his father or peers because most families needed to take care of their problems on their own. Today, we even have an app to bring bread to our door for breakfast, fresh from bakery. Maintenance and heavy work services are outsourced and most people grow without learning the skills to do them alone. In many modern families fathers also take leave from work and stay home to take care of the child while mother continues to work normally. Therefore this kind of assumed gender roles just like this post are dissipating slowly to adapt to the new living standards, fewer gender roles and modern society. Many studies showed that for a happier life and marriage, the couple (husband-wife, wife-wife, husband-husband) should divide all the housework equally without making a preference or assigning a gender role to a task.",espoirde,t2_4cjd8w3t,3,0,reddit2

gpjkq5g,t3_lwh1eo,2021-03-03 15:39:35,science,"I'm leaning towards confirmation bias on this one. The study abstract doesn't feel with a couple of important factors that help determine role distribution: 


1. Social constructs of gender in North America that inform almost everyone's experience. Most people want to fit in with their peers, and so take the path of least resistance. That means we adopt traditional gender roles early on. These expectations are reinforced heavily throughout our formative years by parents, extended family, education, etc. 

2. Historical context. Early on survival depended on certain norms, but many modern role divisions come from ideas of property/ownership. Some cultures were/are women centric in that power transfers down the matrilineal line. Roles were not so clearly delineated in these examples.


3. Personal beliefs of study participants. Married/committed with children - the vast majority of such couples fall into #1 above, otherwise they would deviate (ie. Uncommitted/no kids, or single parents). 


There are more concerns, but these are my biggest three. It's a cherry picked data set that confirms a social norm without examining the psychology of the study participants. Anthropologists can tell you that the simple act of being observed can drastically alter subject behavior. Then it becomes a question of whether the answers are true or if the subjects are trying to answer the 'right' way.",DRMontgomery,t2_tu0r9,1,0,reddit2
gpjxmbw,t3_lwh1eo,2021-03-03 17:12:03,science,"This study is deeply misleading. Firstly, equitable distribution of labor could still entail different types of specialization. Many sociological studies have shown that in the United States there is an inequitable distribution of actual non-waged family labor with women doing more work at home, even when they work the same number of waged hours as their partners. Secondly, the notion that ‚Äúevolution‚Äù explains this is a bizzare just-so story to justify the status quo and fails to consider that cultural factors could significantly influence experience, perceived desirability, forms of gendered hierarchy, and the perceived acceptability of work. Since the early 20th century, cultural anthropology has shown a wide degree of cultural variation in gendered human labor practices. A better designed study that aims to arrive at some sort of universal theory of gendered labor preference would have to look at a broader cross section of human cultures and be able to experimentally rule out the factors that a wide body of social science literature currently attributes this difference to, namely the sociocultural effects of gender hierarchies.",walmas,t2_d5lhp,1,0,reddit2

gphzxw8,t3_lwh1eo,2021-03-03 04:23:39,science,"Others have already pointed out that the very premise of the study is questionable -- that the ""egalitarian"" option for household tasks is not mom and dad each doing 50% of every single task, but 50% of the combined total labor across all tasks.

But the study is lacking for another critical reason. It dismisses the idea that cultural norms shape which tasks are more likely to be taken up by men vs. women, in favor of the idea that *preferences* somehow naturally create a gendered differentiation.

However, it does not make any effort to examine what, if anything, influences those preferences. For instance, it is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis that strongly coded cultural signals cultivate preferences in women for child-rearing tasks, and in men for, say, yardwork and maintenance tasks. This would be important to tease out at least to some degree because humans don't always possess the introspective capabilities to understand what their own preferences even are.

One solution in the research design could have been fielding the questionnaire to couples from each generation. It would be interesting to see if preferences have changed over time as the role of women in society has expanded, along with their personal and professional opportunities. You could also ask the couples how their own preferences have shifted with time -- that is, whether they entered the marriage with a strong preference for childcare or yardwork or whatever else, or if these preferences emerged as they grew their families. That could reveal whether prior expectations were realized or their roles were settled into later.",cinemagical414,t2_6hok5,-1,0,reddit2

(Of course, I'm making huge sweeping generalizations). 

My wife and I (same sex couple, with 4 daughters) didn't have the luxury or pains of sticking to the gender norms when it came to every day house work. I love to cook, and also all the diy home care from replacing the garbage disposal to installing new bathroom or kitchen appliances/sinks, etc, and she's a big weirdo about how the laundry is done and also loves mowing the lawn and doing outside home maintenance. Boom, it's decided. We do what we enjoy! She's a huge fan of total neatness in all aspects of our home but kids aren't neat (and I'm only fairly tidy), so we met halfway and raised our kids to understand that we are a family group and everyone has to do their part to keep the household running smoothly by doing their own part. There's no ""women's work"" or ""a man's job"", we just pitch in and do everything all together.

gpi6498,t3_lwh1eo,2021-03-03 05:29:24,science,"I lurk quite a few parenting subs (particularly those that focus on overwhelmed mothers) and it doesn't seem like they enjoy the drudgery of daily cleaning, cooking, and domestic management any more than their male partners do. 

The commonly cited forces of why being:
1. If the women feel they do not do domestic tasks, then those things will be neglected because the men either don't want to do it or feel it isn't their ""role"" to do it. It's not that women enjoy ""greater responsibility"" of things like childcare like the article suggests, they just fear the consequences if they aren't the ones handling it. Sorry to say, but there's higher stakes for when a child's needs go neglected than if the lawn doesn't get cut for a couple weeks.
2. Men are not as conditioned to be homemakers (exceptions to everything, of course), so if they want to help their partners around the house, they either don't know how or do an incompetent job. It forces women to be micromanagers and instructors to the point where they figure it's less hassle to just do the work themselves.
3. It's still expected of women to be good household managers. Period. And women receive most of the shame and blame if tasks around the house start to slip, particularly when it comes to childcare. Some women fear that if they talk about how they dislike these things (especially when it comes to raising kids) that they will be labeled bad partners and mothers. Do women really get a fair space to voice dislike and frustration about domestic labor, or are they pressured to say they like these things to keep up appearances?

Consider the frequency of these tasks too and what is fair. Cooking, cleaning, and managing are tasks that need to be performed every single day. 
Compare that to how often the grass needs to be cut (assuming you even have a yard or ""outdoor"" tasks to do...), a light bulb needing changed, or a loose screw adjusted. Everyday maintenence tasks? Something is wrong if there is! My guess as to why women don't ""prefer"" outdoor and maintenance tasks, is because that stuff would be ON TOP OF whatever domestic tasks they're also juggling--I've seen what single moms with yards and deadbeats do. 

I'm not here to mess it up for couples who have decided that certain preferences have worked out for them for reasons. I'm just here to tell what I've seen, and that maybe evolutionary psych makes some pretty flawed reasonings.",Suspicious_Sandwitch,t2_7coqf61n,1,0,reddit2

This is referring to a preference for gender aligned tasks. 'Actually' is likewise a weird phrase here, since that people on average prefer gender typical tasks in adulthood was never in question in the first place. The question here firstly has always related to the extent to which early socialisation plays a role in this; how much of what we like is entirely free will.

But since human is social being, we are not solely depending on biological traits. We value something more than a survival and reproduction, thanks to society. So we became something more than just animal, human being.

What these scientist trying to say is that animal level of gender role not society level gender role. Surely 'it' still effect our human life but you don't need to be offended or afraid. We can just doesn't care.

Stereotypes are sometimes a real, observable thing. Probably in large part because of conditioning. 

The pushback against stereotypes is to:

1) push back against the conditioning

2) normalize the idea that stereotypes should not define how somebody is treated or what they're allowed or expected to do in life.

3) push back against the bias that forms in people when they believe stereotypes (a study saying ""men and women prefer"" is meaningless in day-to-day life because you still need to actually find out from an individual how they feel about things).

Real life contradicts stereotypes all the time. Statistical likelihood based on narrow study of a specific culture means virtually nothing in practice when it comes to dealing with an individual and their preferences, and it's critical that people internalize this.",,,1,0,reddit2

gpib104,t3_lwh1eo,2021-03-03 06:28:55,science,"It‚Äôs not surprising that this study found a majority of people prefer roles that have been, for the past few hundred years, taught to us based on our gender. If a study about makeup had also found married women overwhelmingly prefer wearing makeup and their husbands preferred cutting their hair short, it wouldn‚Äôt necessarily mean that men and women genetically, or even naturally, prefer these things. You would expect that to be the result, because that‚Äôs what society considers the norm. 

It‚Äôs disheartening to see a science magazine revert to the old evolutionary theory model to try and explain this, as though this preference is somehow built into men and women, is proof of how men and women are different. Now, men and women *are* different, but the tasks we perform as part of our roles in society are an example of differences we accept being projected onto ourselves. We could just as easily not accept them. It‚Äôs not surprising that men, who are taught to work with machinery and rely on physical strength, like doing yard work; while women, who are taught to provide and nurture, enjoy cooking and cleaning. 

The evolutionary theory (as opposed to the societal theory) can easily be disproven by looking at same-sex couples, who also divide work based on tasks they enjoy; it‚Äôs just that the tasks they enjoy are less likely to be based on traditional gender roles.",o0oo00o0o,t2_3wkte,1,0,reddit2

Men and women are both socialized their entire lives to believe certain jobs and women‚Äôs work and certain jobs are men‚Äôs work- it‚Äôs not surprising to find that a lot of people divide up home labor along gender lines. It‚Äôs part of gender performance writ large for a lot of people. 

You might as well say ‚ÄúWomen tend to prefer skirts much more than men, who favor pants‚Äù. I mean, yes, that is almost certainly true- but not because The Female Brain is hardwired to like skirts, or any inherent girl-ness in skirts. It‚Äôs just that all men grow up absorbing the idea that skirts are not men‚Äôs clothing.

Also, to be clear, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything WRONG with dividing labor along traditional gender lines if that works for you, but I do think one should acknowledge that, like most gendered things, it is *completely* arbitrary and you don‚Äôt HAVE to do it that way if you don‚Äôt want to.",PK1312,t2_9kykh,1,0,reddit2

gpimy61,t3_lwh1eo,2021-03-03 09:26:10,science,"This is just even more complicated when you think of maternity/paternity leave, for my country anyways. Women are provided with 6 months leave after having a baby, the partner gets two weeks. So even if the woman would like to go back to work, the childcare tasks inevitably fall to her and even when the partner comes home, you‚Äôve spent 8+ hours with that baby and are now the one with the skills to take care of said baby easier. (That being said, it‚Äôs no excuse for hogging baby and not encouraging your partner to gain those skills. It‚Äôs just harder for them to do the things because they haven‚Äôt been able to put the hours in, so I can imagine that sometimes situations will arise when the woman gets left with baby just because it‚Äôs easier)

That being said, we‚Äôve two little girls now and my husband works from home twice a week... we both wear fitbits (even though our littlest one stops us from any serious exercising right now, we like to try get our steps to 10,000 a day) and by end of the day while he works from home and I‚Äôm taking care of the kids, I easily have twice the steps he does. (Which then means I‚Äôll take the kids for another 30-60 mins when he‚Äôs done with work so he can get some steps in/workout/play drums orrrr he‚Äôll run out on an errand just to a moving a bit) 

But then again, while I‚Äôm feeding baby, I get a chance to watch tv, or when she naps, I‚Äôll get a chance to grab lunch. Sometimes for her nap, I‚Äôll put her in the buggy and bring our toddler to the playground which means I get out for a nice walk. I think I‚Äôve seen my husband take a lunch twice in the last two months. So... do I sometimes envy him leaving the house to go to work 3 times a week? Yes. And I‚Äôd prefer if maternity leave could be more evenly split between the partners because I miss my job and my colleagues. Do I think I‚Äôve the harder/easier job? No. It‚Äôs just different. So the system sometimes makes me feel resentment, but it‚Äôs not directed at my husband. 

I think as long as you‚Äôre honest and hard working, and so is your partner, you won‚Äôt feel resentful of your partner. You know they pull their weight because you both just do what needs to be done, when it needs to be done, and don‚Äôt keep score. 

Although I do wish he‚Äôd clean the counters more. Or dust. But they‚Äôre such small tasks and he mows the lawn so it seems to even out even at that!",daughterdipstick,t2_3j97r2al,1,0,reddit2

gpjdzs1,t3_lwh1eo,2021-03-03 14:48:46,science,"I have an anecdotal but I've seen it a lot and because this thread has turned into a man bashing party...

A couple I know just got divorced because of infidelity (hers).  The female was a life long friend, the male was someone who became a friend over time. He had a full time job, he worked 50 hours a week and had a 45 minute commute.  She never had a job.  As far as I know he did some things, he'd cook on the weekends (mostly grilling), he took care of all the bills (which is one of the worst tasks tbh) and did all the ""man"" things that men get no credit for because it's ""occasional"" rather than daily. He was loving (I could see that). To me, he seemed like a good husband all around. I know for a fact he adored her.

After the dust settled it was learned that she felt underappreciated, she felt she was doing ""everything"" and she became depressed and eventually feeling unloved (because it grew into something else) cheated. (He said he was always affectionate and appreciative and told her)  The main part of her explanation or justification of the cheating was that she was unhappy because she ""did all the work"" for ""years"" and that led to the other things.  

She went to therapy (while separated) and in therapy she realized all of the things that HE did that SHE did not acknowledge.  She excited called him to tell him she ""got"" it now and that he was a good man.  He decided to end it, but she wanted him back not only because she realized he was a good person, not the uncaring slob but also because now she has to literally do everything and get a job and life is hard and of course, her boyfriend dumped her. The grass wasn't greener.  It's pretty brown and bleak for her now.

I know this because she now calls me every time there is something wrong to be fixed or done and I reluctantly go over only to be saddled with her grief and guilt.. Last week she asked if I could come over to get some things down from the top shelves and I told her to buy a step stool, she got mad at me... Hasn't changed a bit.

This isn't a bash on anyone, they should have talked to each other more and men cheat on women too, and some men are just lazy slobs, this is just a quick anecdote about ""chores"" and how if you don't communicate or acknowledge EACH OTHER bad things can happen.

I guess my comment is also to those in this thread who pretend that housework is hard and the person going to work doesn't matter so DIVORCE is clearly the only answer.

Housework is NOT hard, bringing up kids is NOT hard. If you think this, you are either lying or you're doing it wrong. I've done both and I would 1000x rather stay at home and do those things than go to a 9-5. The only time you can compare the two, no matter who is doing what, is if you BOTH have a 9-5. Then you can call out the lazy one.

If your SO is working a 9-5 and you're complaining about doing the laundry, you're an ass and anyone not agreeing with this simple fairness, well, you're entitled to your opinion but... good luck.",ObiWanCanShowMe,t2_ty9l2,1,0,reddit2

But want to make the point... as a woman I enjoy many house hold tasks like cooking but my male partner much prefers cleaning tasks. I would love to do more maintenance tasks BUT was NOT taught at from a young age and not as adept at my partner. So he‚Äôs at the level of enjoyment/more efficient... whereas I‚Äôm at a learning stage/frustration and not efficient thus little enjoyment. Sooo just because a study is done based on enjoyment levels does not equate to girls like doing doing housework/child rearing based on natural traits... it just likely points back to gender roles a lot of us grew up with and struggle to get out of at a later stage. Learning is harder when older not to mention life and the little time we have outside work to accomplish tasks and still find enjoyment (not to mention when kids are actually involved because who even has time then?)

If a study about makeup had also found married women overwhelmingly prefer wearing makeup and their husbands preferred cutting their hair short, it wouldn‚Äôt necessarily mean that men and women genetically, or even naturally, prefer these things. You would expect that to be the result, because that‚Äôs what society considers the norm. 

It‚Äôs disheartening to see a science magazine revert to the old evolutionary theory model to try and explain this, as though this preference is somehow built into men and women, is proof of how men and women are different. Now, men and women *are* different, but the tasks we perform as part of our roles in society are an example of differences we accept being projected onto ourselves. We could just as easily not accept them. It‚Äôs not surprising that men, who are taught to work with machinery and rely on physical strength, like doing yard work; while women, who are taught to provide and nurture, enjoy cooking and cleaning. 

The evolutionary theory (as opposed to the societal theory) can easily be disproven by looking at same-sex couples, who also divide work based on tasks they enjoy; it‚Äôs just that the tasks they enjoy are less likely to be based on traditional gender roles.",o0oo00o0o,t2_3wkte,11,0,reddit2

I did almost all of the heavy lifting with some help from other people when I needed it. It took about three full days working from 8am to around 6pm to move all the stuff into our new place. Every piece of furnature, every box, all of it. When that was all done my GF came to me and handed me a glass of wine and said that from now on I don't have to do anything. I don't have to unpack anything, move anything, cook or clean until I've rested for a couple of days.

Unpacking boxes and cleaning our new flat isn't going to take nearly as much time as the moving did, but the utility is about the same in my opinion. I have no interest in unpacking boxes, I have no skill at making our place look nice, but I know that I will appreciate it if it is done. Just like my GF doesn't really have the strength to lift all of the heavy things (she tried, she couldn't) and did have any interest in drive back and forth with the truck to collect stuff and bring it to the new place.

gpifr9d,t1_gphftqz,2021-03-03 07:34:03,science,"I remember a survey in which single women reported 14,5 hours a week doing home tasks and single men 14 hours. In couples without children women did 28 hours and men 14,5 hours. In couples with at least one children men increased the amount of hours but women were at 31 hours.

So the big jump in number of hours worked in homework for women raised when living as a couple, rather than when having children. Also, note how a household of two will probably don‚Äôt need twice the amount of hours spend on maintaining it and homework tasks (things like cooking don‚Äôt take twice the time, cleaning won‚Äôt take twice the time, etc...), but because women doubled the amount of hours spent on it the moment they started living with their partners the total amount tripled.

This findings put in doubt the suggestion that just because someone has a perception and therefore a complain that means their perception is objective. It actually could suggest women, on average, decide to spend many more hours that they before deemed necessary to home tasks the moment they start living with a male partner. Why? I don‚Äôt know.

Same goes for the bathroom. Let‚Äôs say you have a shower, toilet and sink in a relatively small area. Assuming you don‚Äôt do your business all over the toilet seat then cleaning that takes 5 minutes. Sweeping or vacuuming you can do but really that‚Äôs a separate chore and doesn‚Äôt have to be done every time. Wipe down your mirror takes 2 or 3 minutes. Clean the sink and bench takes 2 or 3 minutes and the shower takes another 5 assuming everyone leaves it the way they found it when they‚Äôre done.

They are correspondingly larger jobs though, which should also be taken into account.

Two years ago I helped dad built a terrace, and mom wanted it to be big enough for the entire extended family to barbeque on so that's what she got.   

In total that was a couple months of work.    
Which included removing the old one.    
Digging holes to bedrock for the supports so it wouldn't sink.   
Putting down a literal ton of gravel (which had to be wheelbarrowed in and shoveled) to prevent grass from growing under it.    
Planks had to be measured and cut.    
Somewhere around 4000 screws which where put in from the side of each plank so you don't get splinters on top.    
And the whole thing needed to be done neatly and accurately so it's all level and all the planks line up.

Doing car work isn't something that just anyone can do; men frequently do that because they've been trained since they were children by their dads/uncles/whoever, and/or because they taught themselves to do that work ever since they got a car as a teenager.  You can't just take someone who's never turned a wrench, give them some tools, and tell them to go swap a CV axle.

In addition, I completely disagree that this kind of work is something you can assume any person with a penis can do.  I can do this stuff (I've been doing it since I was a teenager, including an engine rebuild), but most men I've met simply cannot.  They can't even change their own oil.  I'd say out of all the people who do their own car work, it's 98% men, but it's only a small fraction of men who do.  It's like amateur ballet dancers: probably 98% of them are women, but only a tiny fraction of all women are amateur dancers.

So sure, there's a cultural component here (women aren't usually trained by their dads to fix cars, though I dated a girl in college who was), but you can't fix that by just throwing a wrench at someone: it takes time and effort to get trained to do many of these things.  Most people don't work on their cars at all these days: they take them to the dealership and spend scads of money for someone else to do it.

\>And if our culture taught us something else, we‚Äôd be happier doing that.

People like what they like.  If you don't like whatever ""our culture"" teaches you, then pursue something different.  ""Our culture"" isn't physically forcing anyone into these roles.  You mentioned BBQ above.  I'm a man, and I hate BBQing.  I would never get a grill for myself.  The last time I had anything from a BBQ grill, it was at a female friend's house, and her daughter was doing the grilling, because she liked doing it.  I've literally never heard anyone say ""women shouldn't barbeque, that's man's work"".

\>No one likes picking up dog poop.

That's a personal choice.  No one actually needs a dog.  So I hope people in couples aren't expecting their partner to share equally in the dog-maintenance tasks if only one of them really wanted the dog.  (Personally, I refuse to date anyone who has a dog; I've found this makes it pretty much impossible to date white women over the age of 30 now.

Which is really the same.  The extra half-hour is statistically insignificant, especially since this survey depends on self-reporting, which isn't very accurate.

\>So the big jump in number of hours worked in homework for women raised   
when living as a couple, rather than when having children. Also, note   
how a household of two will probably don‚Äôt need twice the amount of   
hours spend on maintaining it and homework tasks

This I find interesting; I've read about something like this before, and I think some if it is caused by different peoples' different standards.  So, for instance, one person in the couple (usually the woman) insists on spending much more time with house work because she wants her place to be extremely clean and well-organized, and the other person (usually the man) has lower standards and isn't interested on spending on so much time on these things.  This can be a big source of relationship friction: the woman gets mad that the man isn't putting as much work in as she is, and he doesn't understand because he doesn't see why things need to be so clean or organized.

I think a lot of these studies carry a certain implicit assumption that there's a fixed and uncontroversial amount of household labor that ""needs"" to be done, and this just isn't the case.  People can live in a ultra clean and organized house, or they can live in a pigsty; it's a matter of personal preference.  Should the bathroom be cleaned once a month, once a year, once a week, or every day?  The cleaning time for each scenario is roughly the same (a little less when it's done more frequently, but not that much less), but the total cleaning time per year is vastly different for each, as is the actual cleanliness day-to-day.  There is no correct amount of cleaning: it's personal preference.",SmaugTangent,t2_h4ple,1,0,reddit3

People who rent houses, for instance, are frequently responsible for all the yard work (and snow removal).  I've rented multiple houses over the years and it's always been this way for me.  But maintenance and repair on the house itself is always the landlord's responsibility.

And lots of people are homeowners in single-family homes, which of course have yards, and also maintenance/repair on the house itself.  From what I've read over the past year, lots of people have moved out of northeast cities and to cheaper places (usually in the south) where they've purchased houses.

But if you live with your SO in an apartment where you're only responsible for cleaning, you also have laundry, food prep/cleaning, etc. to do, so you need to factor all that in as well.  If your SO is doing all the cooking and laundry and dealing with the pets, you can't expect him/her to also split the bathroom cleaning, for instance.",SmaugTangent,t2_h4ple,1,0,reddit3

That's the entire point of specialization of labor.  You can't expect every human to be equally efficient at every task, so you assign tasks to workers based on their skills and efficiency (though, frequently, those skills are self-selected: people pursue learning skills they're more interested in).

Ideally, I would think a couple would want to spend a roughly equal amount of time doing chores (assuming both hold full-time jobs; this would be different if one does not), and would concentrate their chore time on the tasks they're each most efficient at, so they can both maximize their free time while having an equitable relationship.",SmaugTangent,t2_h4ple,2,0,reddit3

Researchers recently discovered that in ancient hunter gatherer societies, women hunted big game along with the men, that no division of labour existed based solely on gender. With the advent of ""civilization"" that brought in a socially constructed division of labour, and carried on through history as certain civilizations conquered the world, then there was a switch to controlling female lives/roles and having ownership over wife/children. It was not at all a fact of every human society out there, but history belongs to the victor.

There are an infinite amount of examples where it was thought women were biologically inferior in some way, or inherently different, only to be disproven at a later date.  Nobody knows anything, to be blunt.

Dividing up chores based on what people personally like doing just isn't feasible. Chords are called chores precisely because most people don't like them. At best you tolerate some chores more than others, or have one or two you actually enjoy (let's say playing with your child is fun, but taking them shopping for new clothes isn't, so the former isn't a chore but the latter one is), but not most.

I believe that was my point. There's a huge disparity in hours worked by men and hours worked by women and the degree of difficultly of that work itself. Not discounting women's larger contribution to work in the home but I do think that men's larger contribution to work in the field vastly discounted. I don't think you can really claim that 1 ""traditional woman's hour"" (for lack of a better term here, really) in the home where you're totally the boss, in an environment you've created/nurutured surrounded by the people and things you love more than anything in the world who love you back is comparable to 1 hour in the field surrounded by people who's entire goal is to either outcompete you or exploit you for profits. But that's what happens all the time.

\>Cutting grass in the summer with a noisy mower is anything but fun IMO 

Using machines to do work is pretty fun. But for real maintenance of a house is a semi-full time job. And this isn't about what a lot of men would prefer. Women typically prefer not to do that maintenance and men do.

\> Who does which chore should be up to each couple to decide, because there seem to be clear preferences, and I see nothing wrong with that

Well I mean exactly. Again that's the point and the conclusion of the study. Work in the home is way more often than not depicted as an unfair burden on females. What the study actually found is that one of the driving reasons women do more housework and men do the handyman work (again, for lack of a better term here) is because they actually prefer the work and this is what couples actually want.

WHAT? Methodology is literally the most important part of any study. Methodology is how we do the whole thing! What else am I supposed to look at to see how solid a research is? If methodology is flawed, study is flawed. 

I see: in a heavily conservative part of a country, they chose 500 (GREAT SAMPLE SIZE!) people, asked them how they preferred their chores, and put down their conservative norm responses as ""natural preference"" with the implication of *uninfluenced by outside factor preference*.

Cultural conditioning is EVERYTHING to a human.

This study is of Western Americans, almost certainly predominantly middle class and white. In that particular group of people, men are enculturated to understand that the ""natural"" order of things is for them to do more labor-focused tasks regarding maintence of the home, and women's roles are largely to be in charge of the general organization of family life and the bulk of child rearing. Most people in this particular culture have this hammered into their brains from the time they're very young, and it shapes how they view their own life and the lives of others, and the idea of the division of gender roles becomes ""common sense"". But it's not. Not every culture has this division. Many do, and fhat's mainly because many are sedentary and agricultural at this point in time.

The point is, you're not looking at this in the context of the world and how the world works, only how you view the world and the ""common sense"" YOUR culture has imposed on you from the time you were a child. Not saying you're necessarily part of the culture in the study- but based on the majority of Reddit users, it's likely you are, or are in a culture very similar to it. Many dominant cultures currently hold this view as common sense- that there is a natural division of labor between men and women.

For example, toys are divided by gender. So, girls had more experience with motherhood and cooking (dolls, toy ovens) while boys have experience with manual labor and outdoors activities (construction equipment.) 

And these children either aren‚Äôt presented with the things that strayed out of their gender norm, or when they did take an interest, they were actively discouraged/bullied. Because of this gender division throughout our entire lives, the chores here become something that we are ‚Äúsupposed to do.‚Äù And we don‚Äôt have the same ability as the other gender because we‚Äôre less experienced in it. Men who do the childcare would feel panicky and emasculated, and women doing yard work would feel like it‚Äôs too exhausting and would fear injury/being seen as ugly and man-ish.

gphrvmj,t1_gphmtpl,2021-03-03 03:10:02,science,"No, but Veli has something of a point. I think the real reason, which due to population mechanics is no longer relevant, is simply that women in the old days were super, super valuable for a single express thing *only* they could do: Cart around a fetus while it develops, resulting in a baby.

This means cultures that sent their women into battle would have a lot harder time of things since the dead warrior women wouldn't be around to make babby - and since one dude can make 100 babies in 9 months but one woman can only make one in that time, the mechanics work out that when you have a small enough population, sending your young women off to die in war is ill-advised. So they got stuck at home instead, and the men went off to fight.

Then when the men came home, they had all the big muscles and grit of a veteran warrior and could push the women around, and since the womb doesn't care much about how liberated a woman feels, the new warrior caste takes over and turns the women into pawns and trophies.

I don't doubt there's some half-baked evolution at play after thousands of years of outright sexism, but I suspect it's not a real major player anywhere. And as I said, the above only applies to small populations where the number of women dying in a war is potentially significant to your total population - unless things go nuclear, there's basically no way that'll be the case today. And with how hard we try to push the idea that we're an individualist and egalitarian society, it's pretty embarrassing to cling to the idea that someone can't do something just because it wasn't wise to do 1000 years ago when the variables were different.

A [2019 meta-analysis](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/bul0000191) covering 128 studies of gender differences in spatial reasoning found

> no gender difference in mental-rotation skills among preschoolers, but a small male advantage emerged in children between the ages of six and eight.

Moreover, 

> It takes most of childhood and adolescence for the gender gap in spatial skills to reach the size of the difference seen in adulthood. 

The authors did not exclude a biological explanation for some or all of this difference, but it's important to note what else happens during this time. For example,

> previous research has shown that parents use more spatial language when they talk to preschool sons than daughters. Studies have also found that girls report more anxiety about having to perform spatial tasks than do boys by first grade, and that children are aware of gender stereotypes about spatial intelligence during elementary school.

So, the fact that men typically demonstrate better spatial reasoning than women may reflect an innate difference or it may reflect the fact that our expectations of this difference lead us to treat boys and girls differently, thereby creating this difference in ability (or some combination of the two).

If I take my kids to the grocery store I'll get middle-aged ladies telling me what a great dad I am. Bonus points if one of them refers to me as 'babysitting my kids'. For my wife, that's an expectation by society. If there is a reaction, it will be more along the lines of 'why can't you control your kids better?'. 

If the house is messy when someone walks in, my wife gets the social embarrassment, and I don't.

If I'm feeding a bottle to my baby, I'll be praised for being such a good dad. My wife will be criticized for not breastfeeding.

A 'desire to fit in' can absolutely be societal oppression when the social contract and expectations are not equitable. And just because someone has been socialized to accept this or even enjoy it doesn't mean it's not worth changing and calling attention to it as a form of oppression.

Society places a premium on a woman's looks and nurturing in determining her value, so it's *no wonder* that many women enjoy blogs/videos/articles about beauty gurus, cooking channels and weight loss. Society places a premium on men's economic output, which is why men prefer to consume blogs/videos/articles about efficiency, success, and other material self-improvement porn.

There is a huge amount of cultural inertia in things like the way men and women are represented in various industries. Towards your examples: it *could* be that women don't tend to go into engineering trucking jobs because they're not as suited for it, but even if that's true, it's also true the these are jobs that women simply didn't have access to for decades. That imbalance can perpetuate itself in a lot of ways. Things like not having role models you identify with in a certain field can make that field less appealing, but it can also be much more concrete than that. Like in trucking, one of your examples, almost all truck cabs are designed for men, who, on average, have a longer reach and are heavier than women. And in many truck stops, the only showers available are in the men's restroom. But in recent years, due to a shortage of truckers, companies have started adjusting some of these things and recruiting women more actively, and [women have started to make up a greater number of the industry](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/06/america-keeps-on-trucking.html) (though they still lag men by a huge margin).  
This is just one example in one industry, but the point is the point is that we shouldn't view gender differences (in careers, hobbies, behaviors, etc.) as inevitable results of biological differences, not while there are still cultural inequities to address.   
Also, as an aside, hunter/gatherers: while the idea that early humans divided labor strictly by gender roles is popular and widely accepted, there's actually little to no archeological evidence to support this, and in fact, [evidence we have found](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/45/eabd0310) seems to suggest that human hunters were not significantly skewed male.",makemerepete,t2_knudk,5,0,reddit3

You can have the biggest sample of people but asking people what they imagine in a hypothetical situation is not actually a good way to measure real preferences. That is 323 answers of the 436.

However I think many times relationships start with communication but it is often ignored partially or fully by the other party. I‚Äôm reading many posts on here about people with roommates or partners where they would ask them to clean up after themselves over and over. Eventually they got tired of asking, so the asker just did what they asked. This could easily end up in a situation like in the comic.

As for the other part of what you said, I‚Äôm not sure where you got the ‚Äúemotional labor‚Äù thing from, maybe something else? This comic specifically talks about the mental load. The way you describe your working relationship with your wife implies she does the majority of thinking or ‚Äúmental load‚Äù and you do the majority of the actual physical load. You are actually validating the idea of the mental load by saying you‚Äôre fine doing most of the chores because she‚Äôs the one who plans the groceries, double checks to make sure nothing is forgotten or figures out how not to lose things in the future. Other examples of mental load include figuring out what‚Äôs for dinner, keeping track of the kids schedule, planning fun activities, planning vacations, etc.

Anyway it sounds like you have a balance you and your wife are okay with and that‚Äôs good. However, I think you‚Äôre potentially ignoring how people can get into the situations in the comic and also misunderstanding the meaning of mental load which you yourself describe in your relationship with your wife. I hope this has helped. Anyway, have a good day!

We'd also buy each other take out and just bring it home without asking the other what we were getting, ""dinner's here!"" sorta thing. Yet when it came to household work she did all the laundry and vacuumed/dusted. This included bed sheets and even folding the clothes. I never once asked her to, she just preferred to do it and I guess hoped I'd make up for it in other ways, which I did. I painted the house, I trenched the yard and installed a sprinkler system myself, washing our cars in the driveway, the all too familiar mowing the lawn, and I coordinated any repairs above my skillset like HVAC, laundry machines, hardwood floors. 

Some of those items were only once per year events. It's not like your A/C just fails every summer. Or the interior needs painting. Or ceiling fans need to be hung. Or surround sound systems installed. But I did all those things because they were things she couldnt do at all on her own. So her weekly errands to keep the interior of the home in good shape were to protect her against all the major life events that she doesnt want to worry about, that was my contribution. 

Now I'm sure if our house was self-repairing or all I did was call a 1-800 # to have things fixed she might feel slighted. But the fact that it was ""arranged"" this way through unspoken words and just worked itself out is exactly the kind of thing this article stipulates.

I disagree.

You made some very good points, but I'm slightly confused by your assertion towards the relative impact of Cultural Conditioning over Natural Preference regarding an individuals preferential selection of culturally like-genered roles. 

I agree with your assertion that cultural conditioning of gender normative roles may be so deeply engrained in our subconcious minds that an individual's perceived ""natural"" preference toward any given role cannot be fully differenciated from the life-long cultural expectations they've been conditioned toward.

However, if we take this presumprion and accept it to be true, wouldnt it then be impossible to even vaguely quantify the relative influence that each barrier (i.e. natural or cultural) imparts upon an individual's preferential selection of a culturally ""like-gendered"" role?  That is to say, if these cultural influences are so engrained in our decision making processes, then how can any assertion be made as to which factor was relatively more influential?

That being said you are describing extremes. I'm confused by the idea that women would feel like it's foreign to do yard work? I disagree. I also disagree with men feeling emasculated doing child care. That would likely be an external factor...someone *else* is emasculating them or making women feel like they shouldn't do yard work.

I only say this because my sisters, for instance, relish doing yard work. And pretty much everyone in my family deals with kids. One of my sisters prefers to stay home only because she can while my other sister works along with her husband and they are able to get childcare from a grandparent (whom they actually do pay).

What you are describing seem to be individual, specific choices.

Moreover, I think it probable that variations within a sex are much greater than between them.

As for the study, it is very interesting. However, I would be careful about concluding too much from the fact that out of 11 males from one group of rhesus monkeys, 8 seemed to prefer shopping carts and dump trucks to Winnie-the-Pooh and Scooby-Doo, 1 preferred Scooby, and  2 had no apparent preference. The larger group of females had more varied preferences.

Moreover, it should be noted that while the authors

> offer[ed] the hypothesis that toy preferences reflect hormonally influenced behavioral and cognitive biases which are sculpted by social processes into the sex differences seen in monkeys and humans.

the one concrete mechanism they identify -- prenatal androgen exposure -- appears to produce contrary effects in humans and monkeys:

> As with boys, juvenile male monkeys engage in more rough-and-tumble play than their female counterparts ..., while girls and juvenile female monkeys show a greater interest in young infants.... These striking behavioral parallels are not reflected in parallel effects of prenatal androgen exposure in monkeys and humans. Although rough and tumble play is strongly influenced by prenatal androgen exposure in monkeys ..., it was not increased in CAH girls.... Similarly, infant interest has been found to be less marked in CAH girls ..., but not in female monkeys treated prenatally with small doses of androgen. [references omitted]

EDIT: the ""CAH girls"" are those with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, ‚Äúan inherited enzymatic defect preventing glucocorticoid production that results in elevated prenatal adrenal androgen secretion.‚Äù Apparently, studies have shown that they demonstrate more boy-typical toy preferences than do their unaffected sisters or control girls.",mgacy,t2_3ge01,0,0,reddit3

Because all research I've come across has that age to be from 5 to 9 months minimum, up to 24 months, that they've noted this gendered toy preference. 

What that link above does not mention even once is that, unless you are literally testing babies as soon as they born (and the gender was unknown by the parents), you cannot accurately say that the preference for gendered toys has not been influenced by their environment and nurture vs nature.

Studies continuously show that people treat baby boys and baby girls differently, based on what their expectations are for that gender. I.e. more likely to be gentle and soothing with a baby girl, more likely to play rough and tumble and bounce a baby boy. 

I highly doubt that the babies they've used in the studies your article has linked went without any environmental influence for the first 6-12 months of their life.

But a mans extra strength for example will matter less in a job where things like forklifts are available. Modern society fixes most of the in-ate advantages that one sex may have over the other besides things like sports where this tech isnt allowed. 

  My point isn‚Äôt that these differences don‚Äôt exist, (i think you should reread my comment if you thought that)  i just don‚Äôt think putting that much weight on them is a good idea, and the gender differences that are enforced socially are far more prevalent. (for example, testosterone has been shown to make people cry less, but most men cite people‚Äôs reactions to them crying as the bigger issue than just basic biology) these relatively minor biological differences (men crying less) are spun into major generalized expectations and rules (men arent allowed to cry)",johngreenelover95,t2_5f9tvp63,-4,0,reddit3

All I intended to say was that the only thing that this study indicates is that there is a possibility that further research in this direction could be fruitful. It *does not* indicate very strongly that sex difference are *either* nurture *or* nature. It only really seems to suggest that more research should be done.

Also, the full study is behind a paywall, and the article doesn't go into it, so there's no vouching for the methodology behind this survey. I didn't see anything in the article indicating demographics (outside of the broad sweeping thing about ""middle aged"" people and ""new adults"" or whatever the phrase was) and nothing about how people were selected, which *hugely* matters. 

Like, in an extreme example, if they pulled participants from a lifestyle magazine subscription list (which is obviously exceedingly unlikely) that would make for bad results.

Stop over reaching and going to the extremes when they‚Äôre just talking about a generalisation. Just like with something like nursing, more women go for jobs like that, does that mean men can‚Äôt be a nurse? No, it just means women usually go for caring professions like that instead of the hard labour. And before you say anything, no, I‚Äôm not saying women can‚Äôt go into hard labour jobs.

It should absolutely be legal and acceptable to not fit the mold. But that does not make the mold a malicious entity or a form of oppression. 

Stereotypical gender roles throughout history go back to the beginning of humanity where we were figuring out who was good at/who preferred what. The fact is that when women's voting rights were originally being brought into play, most women didn't even want to vote because they already had enough responsibility at home. That doesn't mean they were unhappy or oppressed. 

But ignoring the fact that we are different and are wired to fill different roles within society is straight up anti-science. We are wired differently. Maybe you think women must feel oppressed because you don't want to be responsible for the things they're typically responsible for. So? We don't want to be responsible for the things men are typically responsible for. Sure we should be allowed to, but don't demonize the mold itself. It's not malicious. It's a form of structure, safety, and communal trust

We had a big talk about it a few years ago because she was so upset at how unfair it was that I was getting raises and she wasn't. The talk really started because she had heard that one of her male coworkers had gotten a raise that she didn't get.  During that talk I asked her what she had asked her bosses for her raise to be. Her response was that she didn't ask. I asked her when the last time she asked for a raise was. She said never. The next day she asked for a raise. And she got it. Every year after that she asked for a raise and she got it. She now no longer believes in the wage gap. She now realizes that most men are just aggressive in asking for what they want and that in her experience from her group of friends she found out that all the girls had never been asking for raises. It started a small revolution in her friend group and they all ended up getting raises except for the one friend of hers that is super quiet and didn't want to rock the boat by asking for one. 

It might be an anecdotal story,  but it's the truth. And maybe someone reading this might go ask for a raise. Who knows.

The main cited study looked at dual-income couples before and after having a child.  Before the child, there was no difference; during the first 9 months of the child's life, there was a difference of ~1h/day.  Worth noting, however, is that [83% of infants are breastfed](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/p0820-breastfeeding-report-card.html), which is an inherently gender-specific task.

As a result, it's questionable whether it is appropriate to ignore the pre-child finding of no difference and instead fixate on the with-newborn finding of a gendered difference during a period of gender-specific requirements.

The wives in the group are all extremely high achieving women with similar high-commitment jobs and similar earnings to their husbands.

Fyi, the data set they're using was collected from 2003 to 2011, so idk how representative it is of current trends for couples with kids, especially since we definitely have more stay at home dads now compared to 2003. I'm also not sure how they actually collected the data (i.e, self reported versus someone actually monitoring it etc). If it was self reported, that seems like it might not actually be representative of what's happening. Also, dual income people have roughly the same amount of paid/unpaid hours, but the men somehow have five more hours of leisure time compared to their female partners, which seems pretty iffy to me. Like, where were those hours spent for women then? 

For the dual income earners, the study doesn't seem to distinguish between roughly equal time at work couples versus one full time and one part time parent. I feel like we have a lot more both full time parents these days compared to 2003 and that's certainly what my perception is of my age peers and also decade older coworkers. I wish they had dug more into those details. A lot of the parents circa 2003 were younger boomers/older gen xers, so this doesn't really take into account generational changes. 

That summary by pew also mentions that as far as free time versus work time, women had their free time much more interrupted by tasks  or were multi tasking etc, which *really* calls the accuracy of those hours into question for me because then actually counting what time was what is much more grey. They didn't get too into what people were doing in their free time, but it would be interesting if they had.",,,4,0,reddit4

gpimh7y,t1_gpikuhd,2021-03-03 09:18:35,science,"I would strongly disagree, based on everything I‚Äôve read, that you can make such a broad claim as every major average difference in behaviors, preferences, or choices have a primarily biological cause. Even the example you gave is much more nuanced than you are presenting it. And it also seems to show a lack of deep experience with the nursing field. Exactly what are the major differences between receiving a nursing vs doctor‚Äôs training in your opinion? What factors are you pointing to that you claim this is primarily biologically driven? Because nurses do a lot more than hold babies and make patients comfortable. The requisite skill set to be a nurse is actually very transferable to becoming a doctor, and many nurses when polled express the opinion that they would make competent doctors, but cite issues such as working hours vs. home expectations on them, toxic environments in school and the workplace, differential treatment in residency, and other cultural issues as barriers to entry. Similarly, many men report that they dropped out of nursing school or nursing jobs because of toxic work environments, the women being the harassers. 

So, perhaps there somewhat of a biological predilection for women to enter nursing. I won‚Äôt claim this isn‚Äôt a possibility. But I will seriously call into question the notion that the extremity of the bias is due primarily to biological influences. I find that doubtful. Nursing and other assistance roles were the first to begin allowing women in when they entered workplaces across the globe. What was once a male-only world, became female dominated, and that carries with it a kind of social momentum. 

You can see a similar shift in early computing. Women used to be much more common in the very early days of computing. They were pushed out over time, however, and this did not correlate to a stated preference shift, but to a shift in hiring practices and work environments. The truth is there is a lot of historical context to any working environment. To claim with surety that they all have primarily biological bases just doesn‚Äôt stand to scrutiny. Note that I am not claiming everything is socially driven either. Merely that, depending on what specific job, preference, or what have you we are talking about, it is inevitable that both biology and social influence play a role.",PennName47,t2_3f3kiw40,14,0,reddit4

I definitely agree it's like a chicken and egg scenario! 

My main issue is with the researchers, because looking at their paper, they make the rather bold assertion (from what I could see) totally throwing out cultural motivations in favor of biological ones, totally ignoring that this isn't the culture norm everywhere, just a trend, which isn't very common in academia because culture determines so much, like we discussed. 

I do agree, it gets murky as to the ""real"" answer. Because cultural conditioning can have the capability to override a biological urge (like overriding sexual urges because of religious values), but biological urges obviously still play a big unavoidable part of life.

An example is that lots of girls would play around in dirt, fight boys, etc. But then our mothers instruct us that it‚Äôs not something girls do and would scold us, making us hyper-aware of what‚Äôs right and wrong for our gender. If our parents didn‚Äôt say anything, we wouldn‚Äôt know that it was wrong to play in the dirt or that we have ‚Äúnatural‚Äù roles to fulfill. 

And of course, this would differ around families. Different cultures prove that. But generally, in Western society, most families divide labor into these two enough to make the average look like this. Media representation and peer opinions also influenced this. 

So as an example, imagine if your sisters were never taught how to do yard work, were put on time out when they pulled up leaves, and were teased as ‚Äútomboys‚Äù by other girls. They‚Äôd quickly associate yard work with negativity and wouldn‚Äôt touch it until later in life, maybe not at all. By their teen years, they would have already have a preference for not doing yard work and prefer doing behavior that they were awarded for. Then, when the scientists ask her which she prefers, of course they‚Äôre going to say they prefer the one that they were taught rather the one they were punished for. 

The extent to which this happens would be incredibly difficult to measure. Because pretty much nobody has 15+ years of data on every gender-influencing decision.

I would also like to mention no one is claiming there aren't biological differences between sexes, and hormones do indeed influence behaviour and physical qualities.

However, it still does defeat your argument, because you based it on a claim that current traditional role division is based on an evolutionary process influenced by the role division in prehistoric times. Instead, we could both argue that role division between genders varies a lot in different cultures and times, e.g.: women had a much more freedom and power in Ancient Egypt than Ancient Greece*, the latter being much younger (maybe not the best example/comparison, but I think you can see where this is going). The currently perceived ""western traditional female role"" has been strengthened during the Middle Ages and witch hunts, where many freedoms (and crafts, such as brewing) women had beforehand were taken. There does not seem to be a single historical line of gender role development. 

Our thinking is biased and we tend to look for affirmation of our opinions in any piece of evidence. It's kind of funny, because just looking at anthropological human remains, you can see a trend of trying to explain away evidence that points against our 'modern' entrenched beliefs. Any way, social research is hard, because you're dealing with a group of biased humans evlauting another group of biased humans and objectivity is objectively (heh) impossible. In conclusion, I don't think one can argue that current social trends are a direct consequence of development based on customs of some prehistoric groups from 10,000 years ago.

Well I'm a self-employed guitar teacher, so... This rambling section of your comment is completely irrelevant to me. Maybe you keep getting interrupted, spoken over, or dismissed because you make a lot of baseless assumptions and speculations about people.

>Sexism is still very alive and well in the workplace, and only through directly acknowledging it can it be eventually eliminated.

Maybe, but the article you used to back up that point is bunk. It says:

""*The study, of 2,270 academics at 24 top UK universities, found the men reached more senior levels than the women,* ***even after parenthood was accounted for***\*.""\*

However, the actual study that they use to back the article up says:

""*being a woman has a negative and significant association with academic rank,* ***except for the case when parenthood is timed with career considerations in mind.***""

The article is saying the opposite of the study they are reporting on. It seems pretty clear that having kids at inopportune times is the biggest hurdle for women in academia, not being held back by their supposed male chauvinist colleagues.",AvocadoInTheRain,t2_b9xb1,2,0,reddit4

> Monkeys live in a socially complex world with substantial maternal support, but differential maternal treatment of males and females is limited to maternal retrieval in response to infant distress and physical inspection of their infant‚Äôs genitals (Wallen, 2005). Sex differences in maternal treatment do not include preventing their male or female offspring from engaging in opposite-sex typed behavior or in encouraging them to interact with specific objects (Wallen, 2005). While social context certainly affects the developmental environment of males and females, it is unlikely that it determines the basic predisposition to engage in specific patterns of sexually differentiated behavior such as interest in infants or rough and tumble play. In the case of rough play, it is likely that females voluntarily limit their participation, not because males exclude them, but because females don‚Äôt find this style of play particularly attractive. Evidence in support of this view comes from female rhesus monkeys prenatally exposed to elevated androgens late in gestation and who look completely anatomically female. Even though they cannot be physically distinguished from females and do not look like juvenile males, they still show male-like levels of rough and tumble play compared to control females (Goy et al., 1988) suggesting that the sexual differentiation of play reflects sex differences in activity preferences and not social constraints on play.

> For each child and parent, we calculated the cumulative number of ... ‚Äúwhat‚Äù spatial words.... [W]e coded three categories of ‚Äúwhat‚Äù spatial words and targeted them for further analysis: shape terms, dimension terms, and spatial-features terms. Shape terms are the names of two- and three-dimensional objects and spaces (e.g., circle, triangle, octagon, and the word shape). Dimension terms describe the size of objects, people, and spaces (e.g., big, little, tall, tiny, small, tall, short, and long). Spatial-features terms describe the features and properties of two- and three-dimensional objects, people, and spaces (e.g., bent, curvy, edge, side, line, and corner). 

Observations:

> we found a sex difference in the production of ‚Äúwhat‚Äù spatial language during preschool years, which was significant during naturalistic interactions occurring when children were between 34 and 46 months old, but not earlier. Compared with girls, boys produced more unique ‚Äúwhat‚Äù spatial words (i.e., dimensional adjectives, shape words, and spatial- features words). This sex difference in spatial-language production is a potential contributor to documented sex differences in spatial skills, including mental rotation, as research finds that spatial-language use is related to children‚Äôs performance on nonverbal spatial tasks.

Also, 

> Utilizing a longitudinal design, we examined whether parents‚Äô use of ‚Äúwhat‚Äù spatial language mediates the sex difference found in children‚Äôs use of ‚Äúwhat‚Äù spatial words. Mediation analyses confirmed that parents‚Äô production of ‚Äúwhat‚Äù spatial types fully mediated the sex difference in children‚Äôs production of unique ‚Äúwhat‚Äù spatial words, even when we controlled for a variety of variables.... Results suggest that parents‚Äô spatial-language input is an important predictor of children‚Äôs spatial productive vocabularies. 

It should be noted that the authors did not form any conclusions as to what drove these differences (i.e. were parents applying gendered stereotypes or were boys engaging in different types of play that offered more opportunities for using spatial words).",mgacy,t2_3ge01,6,0,reddit4

Nonsense. Society did. Society tells people what is expected of them and, to a large extent, deviance from this is punished - often by ones immediate family, then ones peer group, then wider society and sometimes by law.

Of course it doesn't feel like oppression if your desires happen to align with societies plan for you, but if you don't come of of the mold ""correctly"" and you then proceed to step out of line and you will quickly meet with resistance.

> It should absolutely be legal and acceptable to not fit the mold. But that does not make the mold a malicious entity or a form of oppression.

What is a mold if not pressure to conform to a shape that isn't natural? If it is acceptable to ""not fit"" the mold then surely no molding can be taking place.

The fact is peer groups seek to enforce conformity to social norms. You can't support people enforcing the mold and support people breaking the mold at the same time, the two things are opposed.

If by ""mold"" you just mean most of us come out male or female and we shouldn't be ashamed or reluctant to accept the roles society traditionally expects of us then that's fine, if you keep it to yourself. In practice people don't though. People enforce society's norms and the more people deviate from those norms the more push back they get. Remember school? Was being called  ""gay"" a good thing or a bad thing there? People are shamed and bullied in their millions every day for not being normal enough. Try being male and having long hair in any provincial town. Try being female and explaining you don't want children to people. And we have it relatively easy in the west. There is continual pressure to conform to our stereotypical roles from society and if you don't want to conform then it can quickly become oppressive, and if you persist even deadly.",emefluence,t2_fax7a,5,0,reddit4

The truth is both of our answers, actually. It's a combination of a billion variables, ranging from necessity due to evolution, social pressures, genetics, etc.

My personal gripe with what you're saying is a philosophical one. With the society we've built for ourselves now, there is less of an emphasis on survival and more on thriving and maximizing our capacity to make choices and to direct ourselves towards what provides us utility (purpose, meaning, happiness, etc.). So I get annoyed when people use teleological or functionalist arguments about what humans \*ought\* to be. Biology doesn't determine morality, and especially at a time like this we are allowed the freedom to be different. That isn't disobeying nature, that IS nature.

But TLDR I concur that that is probably having to do with our current environment. And I don't doubt that genetics play a factor in our preferences still.

Some live in condos (like me), some live in townhouses, some live in single-family houses (which I've done in the past).  Personally, I would try to avoid renting an apartment, in favor of the other options: you can't stay in an apartment more than 1 year because they always jack up the rent on you so that it makes more sense to move someplace else.  With private landlords, you usually get better treatment because they don't want to waste their time hunting for new tenants every year and losing a month's rent (or more) in the process.  I guess apartments don't have this problem because they have full-time management with nothing better to do than screw people over, and because it's the corporation that's losing money, not them personally.",SmaugTangent,t2_h4ple,1,0,reddit4

Again, in lions, the women both rear young and do most of the hunting. Things can shake out in several different formations despite the existence of sexual dimorphism in many mammalian species.

There are some things that are unlikely to completely *reverse*, such as child rearing.

However, a number of scholars have theorized that such division of labor would have been less pronounced, altogether absent, or structurally different among our early hunter-gatherer ancestors (5‚Äì13). Early subsistence economies that emphasized big game would have encouraged participation from all able individuals. Alloparenting, which appears to have deep evolutionary roots in the human species (14), would have freed women of child care demands, allowing them to hunt. Communal hunting, which also appears to have deep evolutionary roots (15), would have encouraged contributions from females, males, and children whether in driving or dispatching large animals. Moreover, the primary hunting technology of the time‚Äîthe atlatl or spear thrower‚Äîwould have encouraged broad participation in big-game hunting. Pooling labor and sharing meat are necessary to mitigate risks associated with the atlatl‚Äôs low accuracy and long reloading times (16). Furthermore, peak proficiency in atlatl use can be achieved at a young age, potentially before females reach reproductive age, obviating a sex-biased technological constraint that would later intensify with bow-and-arrow technology (17). Last, the residentially mobile lifestyle entailed by big-game specialization is quite conducive to human reproduction and, thus, female hunting‚Äîcontrary to previous thinking‚Äîbecause it reduces net movement relative to central-place foraging strategies (18). This hypothesis is consistent with high population growth rates among early hunter-gatherer populations (19) 

...
It is possible that the WMP6 burial represents a rare instance of a female hunter in a male-dominated subsistence field, but such an outlier explanation diminishes with the observation of 11 female burials in association with hunting tools from 10 Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene sites throughout the Americas, including Upward Sun River (44), Buhl (45), Gordon Creek (23), Ashworth Rockshelter (46), Sloan (47), Icehouse Bottom (48), Windover (49), Telarmachay (50), Wilamaya Patjxa, and Arroyo Seco 2 (51). These results are consistent with a model of relatively undifferentiated subsistence labor among early populations in the Americas.
A similar trajectory may be observed in the European Paleolithic, where meat-heavy diets and absence of plant-processing or hide-working tools among Middle Paleolithic Neandertals would seem to minimize potential for sexually differentiated labor practices (5, 53, 54). Economies diversified in the Upper Paleolithic sometime after 48 ka, with increasing emphasis on plant processing and manufacturing of tailored clothing and hide tents creating new contexts for labor division. When and how such differentiated labor practices emerged from evidently undifferentiated ones require further exploration. Comparative analysis of burial associations with hunting tools and ground stone artifacts (55) in other times and places would be particularly valuable toward understanding how labor division evolved among hunter-gatherer societies. 

...
Scholars have long grappled with understanding the extent to which contemporary gender behavior existed in our species‚Äô evolutionary past. A number of studies support the contention that modern gender constructs often do not reflect past ones (7‚Äì10, 12, 13, 56). Dyble et al. (57) show that both women and men in ethnographic hunter-gatherer societies govern residence decisions. The discovery of a Viking woman warrior further highlights uncritical assumptions about past gender roles (58). Theoretical insights suggest that the ecological conditions experienced by early hunter-gatherer populations would have favored big-game hunting economies with broad participation from both females and males. Such models align with epistemological critiques that reduce seemingly paradoxical tool associations to cultural or ethnographic biases. WMP6 and the sum of previous archaeological observations on early hunter-gatherer burials support this hypothesis, revealing that early females in the Americas were big-game hunters.",yukonwanderer,t2_9qeqr,-3,0,reddit4

There are also studies that suggest that gender identity and preferences are not necessarily the result of lived experiences. In the case of David Reimer, it was quite obvious that what you‚Äôre suggesting is absolutely, unequivocally false. You can raise a biological male and tell him his whole life that he‚Äôs a female, with a stereotypically female childhood and have that conditioning rejected.

That is just false.

>It's impossible to control for all the variables in medicine either but they do a damn fine job doing it enough to get meaningful data.

Sure, but respectable and useful publications find controls to remove bias for the main point of research. For instance, if the study was on the effect of acetaminophen on cytochrome p450 enzyme activities in liver microsomes, they are going to start with liver microsomes that are not exposed. Another set of microsomes that will not be exposed at all to the acetaminophen will also be monitored.

There are also bad publications of data that are rejected over time, have to be revised for methodology, misstatements in the conclusions and so on.

Besides everything stated above; OPs reference reaffirms what is commonly expected considering the *methods* of this study. The conclusion should read, ""In a population where the behaviors of interest in our thesis are the accepted norm, the individuals were happier when they did what they almost always have.""

Yes, societies have waged wars on one another since the dawn of time, but I cannot think of a single society that has been so at war with one another as we are today... barring, y'know, like, the fall of Rome. What we're going through now is even worse because it is global. It's not just the USA collapsing, it is nearly every single western country collapsing. We are so thick and blind with ideological possession that we cannot even have civil conversations about society, by and large. So considering, I think it absolutely makes sense to look back and consider how we got to this point in time, and respect the ways of our ancestors. They made peace with the ways of nature so that we could continue to live and reproduce and flourish. And now, as a society, almost like teenagers we are throwing it back in their faces, mocking them and their ways, and acting like we know better when the only proof that we should need to realize that we absolutely do not, is the health of our society and our communities. Aka VERY unhealthy. 

IMO it is incredibly egotistical to think that biology shouldn't have some stance in our understanding of morality. Apart from our individual thoughts and feelings, the ways of the natural world are our only real common ground for understanding one another, of seeing the bigger picture outside of our personal bubbles. Science has to be a base point for concepts like philosophy, morality, right and wrong, otherwise we are just arguing our feelings as facts.",mamabean36,t2_5njhtam3,0,0,reddit4

That makes total sense. But none of that is inherently interesting to engineers. One of the draws to someone working toward a career in engineering, is the fact that they get to sit at a cubicle all day by themselves.

Before I got laid off because of covid, I was a Program Manager at an aerospace company. One of my primary job duties was to bridge the gap between the engineers and everyone else. I worked with engineers from the customers side, and engineers on our side, one thing they all had in common was their inability to clearly communicate. Mainly because they spent their entire lives thinking about things more than people. The only reason I was successful at the role, was because the majority of my professional background is in sales (almost completely people centric) and just enough of my education was spent focused on engineering.

This is something that has been an interest of mine for a long time. There‚Äôs a company called ‚ÄúIDEO‚Äù you might be interested in researching. The CEO, he might not be the current one, wrote a book called ‚ÄúChange By Design‚Äù and it deals with this topic a little bit. At one point, the company realized they got better results when designing a new product by employing a team that consisted of people with diverse educations/backgrounds, in addition to the engineer. Exactly for this reason.

Further, basically all meaning derived is interpreted and made sense in on a discourse level, so there is an inherent bias.

If you eat 2 meals a day, you will spend 2/3 the time as someone who eats 3 meals a day.  If you make microwave meals and cold cereal, you will spend much less time making food than someone who makes complex baked meals with multiple dishes.

These thing are all personal choices.  No one is forcing you to wash your clothes after every wearing.  You have the freedom to wear your clothes for a week straight if you want to.  (I don't recommend it for most clothes.)  It's very common for men to wear the same pair of jeans for multiple days or even a week without washing them.

gpk8c67,t1_gpj6so4,2021-03-03 18:28:22,science,"Let's assume we have a survey with a single yes or no question. If we asked this question to every living human person (N people), x people would answer with a yes, so p=x/N would be the proportion of yes answers to all answers. Our goal with the survey is to estimate this number p using a limited subset of randomly chosen people from the population. 

Because of the central limit theorem, we know that sampling distribution of sample proportions is going to be distributed approximately normally, with mean sample proportion equal to the population proportion (p‚Çì=p), and standard error equal to SE=sqrt(p\*(1-p)/n), where n is the sample size. This means that if we take all possible n-sized samples of the population, the mean of all proportions we'll get will be equal to p, and the means would be normally distributed around p with a standard deviation of sqrt(p\*(1-p)/n). This means that we can use inverse error function to calculate the number of standard deviations within which 95% of all possible n-sized sample proportions will fall. z=sqrt(2) * erf^-1 (C). Plugging in C=0.95, we get z=sqrt(2) * erf^-1 (0.95)‚âà1.96. Thus, given the population proportion of p and sample size of n, 95% of n-sized samples will result in proportions that will be within the range of p ¬± 1.96 \* sqrt(p\*(1-p)/n). We don't actually know the value of p (otherwise we wouldn't be doing a survey in the first place), but if our approximation is within the range of 1.96 \* sqrt(p\*(1-p)/n) around p, then p is within the range of 1.96 \* sqrt(p\*(1-p)/n) around our approximation. If we substitute our approximation q (our sample proportion) in place of p in that formula, then we get that there is 95% probability that p is within the range of 1.96 \* sqrt(q\*(1-q)/n) around q. 

The upper bound of our 95% interval q + 1.96 * sqrt(q\*(1-q)/n). The lower bound is q - 1.96 \* sqrt(q\*(1-q)/n). The half-length f the interval is thus r = (q + 1.96 \* sqrt(q\*(1-q)/n) - (q - 1.96 \* sqrt(q\*(1-q)/n))) / 2 = 1.96 \* sqrt(q\*(1-q)/n). Solving for n, we get n = (1.96^2 q - 1.96^2 q^2) / r^2. Using this formula, we can calculate the the required sample size n for a confidence of 95% with an interval of half-length (i.e. confidence interval) r.

When calculating the minimum sample size needed for a given confidence level and confidence interval before conducting the survey, we should assume the worst-case scenario of q=0.5, which will give the longest interval. Plugging that in the above formula with a length of 5% (r=0.05), we get:

However this doesnt change the fact that the genders did specialize into different roles. Major proof that suggests that women gathered more than men and men primarily hunted, is how our eyesights are sligthly diffferently evolved. Mens eyes are generally better at separating shapes and changes in brigthness and womens eyes are generally better at differentiating colors

 You can probably already guess where these two differences play a role? In hunting and gathering. Being able to better perceive colors, helps women identify poisonous plants from edible.

I am pointing out that gender roles are enforced (often brutally, in some societies) and those that deviate from them are punished. Therefore you cannot say that gender roles are purely biological because if that was the case there wouldn't be so many people trying to deviate from the traditional model and being punished for it.

Your counter to this is that ""we punish non-normative behavior because humans have difficulty living with differences that make us uncomfortable"". But that's not a counter. I'm not asking *why* people punish deviation. I am pointing out that the deviation exists in the first place, which is why it's *possible* for it to be punished.

Let's think about it in a different way. For a long time, people were punished for being left-handed and would basically be forced to try to become right-handed. When they stopped punishing people for it, [the number of visibly left-handed people rose significantly](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/09/sinister-statistics-do-left-handed-people-die-young.html) (there is a table in the article). Now, obviously most people are right-handed, but it's also clear that societal suppression played a role in the number of left-handed people that exist - that is to say, a lot of people were ACTUALLY LEFT-HANDED and denied it because they'd been taught that it was wrong to be left-handed, and once the stigma was removed, they were fine acting left-handed, the way that's actually comfortable to them.

You say that men and women are naturally different. But then our society punishes men and women who do not fit traditional gender roles. It doesn't matter WHY it punishes them. What matters is that there are people who go against traditional gender roles and are suppressed for it. If gender roles were truly ""natural"", it wouldn't require so much effort to suppress them. Gender is like handedness: if you assume there's only one ""right answer"" you are going to end up spending a lot of time and energy enforcing that ""right answer"" to the detriment of people for whom it is *not actually the right answer*.",Kirbyoto,t2_6x4qg,3,0,reddit4

Thats one of the ways that social scientists use to get around the evidence requirement (even had classes on this) and i don't agree with it.

They are not more complex, they are ethically constrained in ways that the natural sciences are not due to the fact they usually deal with humans rather than atoms. 

If i had trillions of humans (think white mice) that i can do anything i want to to see the outcomes of controlled tests, then it would probably be much better of a science in terms of evidence and much closer to biology in that respect.

I personally do not think they will be able to reach that level till we can map and simulate the human brain in detail

gpj4j3e,t1_gpivvvq,2021-03-03 13:26:50,science,">That meaning is created in discourse does not mean that it's inherently political

Discourse analysis is concerned with power, typically. To define is an act of power unless you're more of a pragmatist. So what is deemed to be the 'proper' scientific method, that is a corresponding theory of truth; an objective world out there free from human bias that can be 'found', is just a form of discourse. 

&#x200B;

>What if I told you that what you enjoy is shaped in discourse with others. You aren't born liking computers and gaming. you aren't born liking to clean. You are taught that.

The problem here is you're assuming an objective interest, that is stable enough for you to even notice it and then list it as an example. This suggests our creations (whether social or otherwise) are relatively stable and open to empirical observation.

&#x200B;

>The discussion is whether it's anti-scientific to posit that interests aren't inherent.

We seem to have differing methodological views. I would say that asking if something is inherent or not is a flawed approach. The effect seems to be the same: agents have interests. To then make the next step and say their interests are wrong is just another form of discourse, one t-shirt for another.

You become anti-science when you assume that it is our theories creating the world, not the world creating our theories. Your reliance upon discourse - turtle all the way down- is anti-science. The second you're normative is the second you become anti-science. 

However, you won't be anti-science if you're epistemologically a pragmatist and have different kinds of facts: social (ie statehood); brute facts (nature bites back through empirical observation) and then hybrid facts which are a mix between the two. This is all subject to further debate. I'd say this problem of the thread- agent interests in terms of housework(!) is a hybrid fact. There may be a biological causal mechanism driving it, but there may also be social. Again, this is subject to an alternative interpretation that may prove more fruitful.

If you have a social ontology and a social epistemology then it is indeed anti-science, as you are saying that 'reality' is just discourse and nothing more. This means having a theory is creating reality, there is no science in this as it's less observation than it is creation.

You're not talking about every man's experience here. You're only talking about your own, and trying to justify it. I'm sorry that you're apparently unable to feel a strong connection to your kid. But it's really something deeply psychological and cultural. Women don't come with some inherent love for babies built in, that's just not how it works. (Also, postpartum depression wouldn't be nearly as common if that were the case). So many mothers don't love their children or are even abusive, while a lot of dads are very emotional and nurturing about their children. Yes, some people seem like they're ""naturals"", maybe your wife is one of them, and you're not. But, as I said, that's not an excuse not to try your best. It's actually not uncommon for both mothers and fathers not to be able to strongly bond with their children when they're still babies or young toddlers. I don't have children myself but I've never found babies very interesting, older children seem a lot more fun.

You should really read up on this, maybe it will change your perspective. If you genuinely don't believe that it's possible for men to feel that ""deep connection"" with their children, you're essentially sabotaging yourself. [Here's a very good article on this](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/aeon.co/amp/essays/how-raising-children-can-change-a-fathers-brain).

As a woman, I am much more aware of all the work my female friends do because they divulge more of that to me separately. We commiserate. We all have loving, well-meaning male partners, but we were raised with higher expectations around maintaining homes, so we do a lot of teaching and management (i.e. the mental load). So while there are guys in our circle, they are not privy to this information and their perception of the balance will be limited to how they see us interact with our partners in person. This is specific to my situation, but I don't think it's uncommon.

Secondly, it's easy to make assumptions about what goes on in other people's relationships when we know them well, but that doesn't mean we have all the information. I'm not saying you're wrong about your friends; this is obviously going to have a high level of variability across cultures, age groups, and the like. It's definitely nuanced. But even based on your comment, I assumed you were probably a guy because, again, men seem to estimate that the work is evenly divided more often than not.

gpja0fm,t1_gpi4aks,2021-03-03 14:16:33,science,"Oh look I can pick and choose too:

The Haas team‚Äôs find was followed by a review of previously studied burials of similar age throughout the Americas‚Äîand it revealed that between 30 and 50 percent of big game hunters could have been biologically female.

Then from the study you Cherry picked:


However, a number of scholars have theorized that such division of labor would have been less pronounced, altogether absent, or structurally different among our early hunter-gatherer ancestors (5‚Äì13). Early subsistence economies that emphasized big game would have encouraged participation from all able individuals. Alloparenting, which appears to have deep evolutionary roots in the human species (14), would have freed women of child care demands, allowing them to hunt. Communal hunting, which also appears to have deep evolutionary roots (15), would have encouraged contributions from females, males, and children whether in driving or dispatching large animals. Moreover, the primary hunting technology of the time‚Äîthe atlatl or spear thrower‚Äîwould have encouraged broad participation in big-game hunting. Pooling labor and sharing meat are necessary to mitigate risks associated with the atlatl‚Äôs low accuracy and long reloading times (16). Furthermore, peak proficiency in atlatl use can be achieved at a young age, potentially before females reach reproductive age, obviating a sex-biased technological constraint that would later intensify with bow-and-arrow technology (17). Last, the residentially mobile lifestyle entailed by big-game specialization is quite conducive to human reproduction and, thus, female hunting‚Äîcontrary to previous thinking‚Äîbecause it reduces net movement relative to central-place foraging strategies (18). This hypothesis is consistent with high population growth rates among early hunter-gatherer populations (19) 

It is possible that the WMP6 burial represents a rare instance of a female hunter in a male-dominated subsistence field, but such an outlier explanation diminishes with the observation of 11 female burials in association with hunting tools from 10 Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene sites throughout the Americas, including Upward Sun River (44), Buhl (45), Gordon Creek (23), Ashworth Rockshelter (46), Sloan (47), Icehouse Bottom (48), Windover (49), Telarmachay (50), Wilamaya Patjxa, and Arroyo Seco 2 (51). These results are consistent with a model of relatively undifferentiated subsistence labor among early populations in the Americas.
A similar trajectory may be observed in the European Paleolithic, where meat-heavy diets and absence of plant-processing or hide-working tools among Middle Paleolithic Neandertals would seem to minimize potential for sexually differentiated labor practices (5, 53, 54). Economies diversified in the Upper Paleolithic sometime after 48 ka, with increasing emphasis on plant processing and manufacturing of tailored clothing and hide tents creating new contexts for labor division. When and how such differentiated labor practices emerged from evidently undifferentiated ones require further exploration. Comparative analysis of burial associations with hunting tools and ground stone artifacts (55) in other times and places would be particularly valuable toward understanding how labor division evolved among hunter-gatherer societies. 

Scholars have long grappled with understanding the extent to which contemporary gender behavior existed in our species‚Äô evolutionary past. A number of studies support the contention that modern gender constructs often do not reflect past ones (7‚Äì10, 12, 13, 56). Dyble et al. (57) show that both women and men in ethnographic hunter-gatherer societies govern residence decisions. The discovery of a Viking woman warrior further highlights uncritical assumptions about past gender roles (58). Theoretical insights suggest that the ecological conditions experienced by early hunter-gatherer populations would have favored big-game hunting economies with broad participation from both females and males. Such models align with epistemological critiques that reduce seemingly paradoxical tool associations to cultural or ethnographic biases. WMP6 and the sum of previous archaeological observations on early hunter-gatherer burials support this hypothesis, revealing that early females in the Americas were big-game hunters.",yukonwanderer,t2_9qeqr,-3,0,reddit4

1.	Most cultures have differing norms when it comes to gender, are these all based on biology and therefore necessary?
2.	if these roles are necessary to the survival of a society, what do you believe we should do if people decide to break them (women don‚Äôt tend to like the restrictive roles they are historically given, men basically had to force them into it.) and if you believe they shouldn‚Äôt be enforced, than does that mean you think people will naturally fall into them based on sex?
3.	Also if these roles are good for the VAST MAJORITY of us than why do groups tend to rebel against them. If they were good, or if they were naturally compelled to do them, than why do people constantly want to get rid of them throughout history.

4.The final bit of your reply implies that loosening these cultural norms is only possible through forcibly injecting hormones into everyone. But all that would do is reverse the roles, not weaken them. Also how would forcing them to act how I want be any different from the way society forces people to act  in accordance to their sex.

You're putting a lot of extra words in my mouth, but delineation between nature, nurture, and the environment's impact on our behavior will usually be difficult to delineate or separate from one another entirely. I mean, I take it as a given that misogyny is ingrained into our society to its detriment, and that traditional gender roles have harmed us in many ways. 


But that doesn't mean we aren't different.. and fundamentally men and women have different bodies, which makes us different. Our hormone compositions and cycles are different, which makes us behave differently...this isn't controversial.


Take other wild animals as another example. Male and female chimps and bonobos behave differently from one another and play very different roles in their respective groups.

Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics, not chemistry. Chemistry concerns itself with the interactions of (systems of) atoms, which are determined by the quantum states of their hull electrons.

There is nothing messy at all about quantum mechanics. However, chemistry is usually about large systems with effectively infinite degrees of freedom, where a full quantum description is neither feasible nor useful.

A single hydrogen atom‚Äôs hull is a simple quantum system whose Schr√∂dinger or Dirac equations you can solve with pencil and paper. Anything beyond a hydrogen *molecule* quickly becomes intractable without numerical models.

Chemistry deals with large numbers of arbitrarily complex molecules, which exist in a statistical distribution of states. A hydrogen atom can be described by a single quantum number, a typical lab beaker has a lot more going on.",eypandabear,t2_8jpmo,0,0,reddit4

The first several encounters were hilarious. I had been working there a while, but got a promotion that also involved way heavier workload.  The first night that I had to stay till around 3AM, I had to use the bathroom before locking up.  I did not expect to see another human being, as our company is small and everyone else was gone by 9PM at the latest, so I didn‚Äôt even bother closing the bathroom stall door.  

Suddenly I hear singing/humming, and jumped off the toilet seat toward the stall‚Äôs doorway, freaking out and wondering if the main entry doors were accidentally left unlocked and some crazy singing murderer was about to get me.  In one instant I see this middle-aged Hispanic lady (she was from Guatemala, I found out later) with headphones on, mopping the floor, oblivious to my presence - but I still hadn‚Äôt processed what I was seeing, and I shouted in panic, which alerted her to my presence, and she shouted/screamed, shocked to see someone there.   (It probably didn‚Äôt help that my pants and underwear were around my ankles, which left my junk exposed).  After a moment of being frozen in place, we both regained our composure (I also ensured I was no longer exposing myself to the cleaning lady) and I explained who I was, and that I worked there, and was working late. We both laughed for a while, as the whole thing was pretty funny in retrospect (she thought it was hilarious that my man parts had been fully visible.   I didn‚Äôt think that part was funny at all, and was beginning to wonder if there was anything particularly comical about my genitalia).  Similar encounters occurred the next several times I was there that late (minus the accidental nudity), until we both got used to running into each other, and were no longer terrified by an unexpected run-in.

Your argument is that humans are robots and are simple products of genetic inputs + society. It's a misstep to reduce the complexity of human decision making to that level.

I have no problem with gender role criticism nor am I biased in that regard. I do have a problem with people making reductive analogies that lend nothing productive to the discussion, or that actively mislead people into thinking humans don't have agency or even a basic self awareness in matters concerning gender roles.

However, a number of scholars have theorized that such division of labor would have been less pronounced, altogether absent, or structurally different among our early hunter-gatherer ancestors (5‚Äì13). Early subsistence economies that emphasized big game would have encouraged participation from all able individuals. Alloparenting, which appears to have deep evolutionary roots in the human species (14), would have freed women of child care demands, allowing them to hunt. Communal hunting, which also appears to have deep evolutionary roots (15), would have encouraged contributions from females, males, and children whether in driving or dispatching large animals. Moreover, the primary hunting technology of the time‚Äîthe atlatl or spear thrower‚Äîwould have encouraged broad participation in big-game hunting. Pooling labor and sharing meat are necessary to mitigate risks associated with the atlatl‚Äôs low accuracy and long reloading times (16). Furthermore, peak proficiency in atlatl use can be achieved at a young age, potentially before females reach reproductive age, obviating a sex-biased technological constraint that would later intensify with bow-and-arrow technology (17). Last, the residentially mobile lifestyle entailed by big-game specialization is quite conducive to human reproduction and, thus, female hunting‚Äîcontrary to previous thinking‚Äîbecause it reduces net movement relative to central-place foraging strategies (18). This hypothesis is consistent with high population growth rates among early hunter-gatherer populations (19) 

It is possible that the WMP6 burial represents a rare instance of a female hunter in a male-dominated subsistence field, but such an outlier explanation diminishes with the observation of 11 female burials in association with hunting tools from 10 Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene sites throughout the Americas, including Upward Sun River (44), Buhl (45), Gordon Creek (23), Ashworth Rockshelter (46), Sloan (47), Icehouse Bottom (48), Windover (49), Telarmachay (50), Wilamaya Patjxa, and Arroyo Seco 2 (51). These results are consistent with a model of relatively undifferentiated subsistence labor among early populations in the Americas.
A similar trajectory may be observed in the European Paleolithic, where meat-heavy diets and absence of plant-processing or hide-working tools among Middle Paleolithic Neandertals would seem to minimize potential for sexually differentiated labor practices (5, 53, 54). Economies diversified in the Upper Paleolithic sometime after 48 ka, with increasing emphasis on plant processing and manufacturing of tailored clothing and hide tents creating new contexts for labor division. When and how such differentiated labor practices emerged from evidently undifferentiated ones require further exploration. Comparative analysis of burial associations with hunting tools and ground stone artifacts (55) in other times and places would be particularly valuable toward understanding how labor division evolved among hunter-gatherer societies. 

Scholars have long grappled with understanding the extent to which contemporary gender behavior existed in our species‚Äô evolutionary past. A number of studies support the contention that modern gender constructs often do not reflect past ones (7‚Äì10, 12, 13, 56). Dyble et al. (57) show that both women and men in ethnographic hunter-gatherer societies govern residence decisions. The discovery of a Viking woman warrior further highlights uncritical assumptions about past gender roles (58). Theoretical insights suggest that the ecological conditions experienced by early hunter-gatherer populations would have favored big-game hunting economies with broad participation from both females and males. Such models align with epistemological critiques that reduce seemingly paradoxical tool associations to cultural or ethnographic biases. WMP6 and the sum of previous archaeological observations on early hunter-gatherer burials support this hypothesis, revealing that early females in the Americas were big-game hunters.

Discipline also is an ongoing task. It‚Äôs never, ever one-and-done. It‚Äôs a process that goes on until they are adults.

Similarly with the flower garden if you both want one then yes I agree it is both people's responsibility and should be treated as a chore. Especially as some places have an HOA that may require you to keep a small flower garden or plants, at which point it is definitely a chore.

Overall it really just comes down to what you both agree is important, and what is seen as important. I'd say if your partner is enjoying the better taste from those vegetables and fruit from the garden then the least they can do is help out in it regardless of whether they consider them important but if they don't enjoy having the garden at all I could see how including it in the balance of chores could cause tension.",Durantye,t2_ka773,0,0,reddit4

It's just an example.  From reading comments in this thread ""how much they do"" is subjective.  It's not just a measure of time.  I'm trying to give an example of how some task can wreak you.  I've done 13 hour manual labor shifts where I've needed a day to recover.  

&#x200B;

> The whole point of this unnecessarily long discussion is that the division of labor in a household is something that can be quantified and studied.  

If you find it unnecessary, I don't aim for the conversation to burden you.  I'm trying to point out that different people will care about different metrics.  Time measured isn't a great metric to study because it ignore difficulty of task, desirability of task and the fact that people measure time differently.  

&#x200B;

If you compare two different people that spend 4 hours ""doing yard work"" or 'cleaning"" they may take different amount of breaks.  Someone might drag things out or double their efforts to rush through it.  Someone might count their personal art project as chore time, while the other sees it as leisure time equivalent to a hobby.  

 Tracking only 'hours spent' isn't that useful.

My overall point is that measures of ""fairness"" are subjective.

&#x200B;

Someone in this thread brought up laundry and the disagreement he and his wife have.  I count my load of laundry as maybe 10 mins of total work even if it's spread out over two hours.  Others might count it as a 2 hour chore even though they spend 1 hr 50 mins of it watching TV.  

&#x200B;

>My wife counts laundry as the time it takes a load to be done - about 2 hours - rather than the time she's actually doing it - about 20 minutes. If she's watching TV while cleaning, that whole time counts even though she keeps stopping completely to watch the television, so it takes significantly longer. She also says that anything you enjoy doing even a little doesn't count as does. So since I get a little enjoyment out of cooking, mowing the lawn, grocery shopping, fixing everything that breaks, etc, none of that counts as chores. I also like doing the chores when she's not home - it's just easier and gives us more time to spend together.Long story short, I think it's not just over/underestimating, but also rules (often subconscious) about what and how to count time on chores anyway.",cronedog,t2_j7bvy,0,0,reddit4

Jobs are just a statistic, they could have any number of reasons. Im talking about how we as a society condition people to act. You say women are naturally subservient to men. I believe that was forced on them due to mens natural superiority in tasks that require a lot of strength. This caused society to form some level of dependence on men. Flash-forward a couple millennia of this and here we are. Strength matters a lot less. But foundation of society has already been layed and that is why it is so hard to change.
 
Counter 2: again you have no evidence that this is due to strictly biological reasons, I could point you to several sources saying women outperform men in stem fields. (Ill edit some in later) Also 30% isnt exactly what I would consider a VAST minority thats still a pretty sizable chunk of those fields. At least not a small enough minority to be considered an outlier.
  
Counter 3: this ones more of an answer than a counter but the list already had this format so whatever. Im talking about feminist protest in general. The word Feminist kinda has a bad name now but even back when everyone can agree it is good they fought for far more than just voting rights. They wanted to fight against the supposed biological roles you were talking about, they wanted to be let into more labor heavy jobs, they wanted more independence, they wanted to not be pressured into taking care of kids etc. . Sorry for the poor wording in my last reply if you misunderstood what I was referring to.

Counter 4: here i must correct myself again-in case you misunderstood , Its not gender roles themselves I hate. If someone chooses to be a traditional husband/wife than they have every right to do that.  But they shouldn‚Äôt be treated as the default. Every man and woman is different in their own way and deserves to feel as if they belong in the society they live in.

I'm not ascribing any particular gender roles to men or women, I just said we are different. And we are, and that is not a bad thing. We are literally, biologically different, we are behaviorally different because we have different hormones coursing through our brains that play out in a myriad of ways (subtle and not), and we are sociologically different as can be observed in every culture. What those differences are in real word terms, ie characteristics like who prefers to clean the kitchen vs clean the garage, are indisputably intertwined in a nature, nurture, environment conundrum. I'm not saying that this study has merit in a debate about pigeon-holing gender roles, I'm (1) saying that differences between men and women as observed in studies are not inherently negative (yes, of course they can be, and often are), and now (2) pointing out that conclusions about differences are a complex calculus between nature, nurture, and the environment. 



I'm just saying don't put your fingers in your ears and exclaim men and women are the same because it's, although culturally important relative to anti-discrimination and acceptance of all people no matter how they present themselves gender-wise, it's not technically true.



You are being as overbroad as I am.
Again, you're not hearing what I'm saying. I'm taking lessons from nature and *analogizing*. You can't possibly argue we aren't still connected to our pre-agricultural heritage...we aren't outside of nature, we are still essentially connected to it and part of it. I'm not saying we are X animal because we are similar to them genetically, or that we should still act in X way bEcAuSE HunTeR GAtherErS dID iT, that would be really silly.


 I'm saying look, all parts of nature have certain roles played by the male and female sexes, and it *stands to reason* that we have some of that in us too. Again, what any of those particular roles or tendencies are is so complicated it may be impossible to definitively say what sociological phenomenons (ie traditional gender roles) can be chalked to our nature vs our nurture vs how the environment impacts those. BUT that doesn't make men and women equivalent. Woman =/= man. We are equal in cultural and legal senses though.

If your argument is boiling down to ""it's not *technically* true"" then you have lost. It's very obvious what conclusions you're hoping to draw and the fact that you're simultaneously backing down on ""gender roles"" while asserting the importance of biology with regards to gender roles shows that you're not being honest about what you're trying to say.

>I'm taking lessons from nature and analogizing.

You're picking and choosing to suit your own purposes. Again, not honest. You say it's ""really silly"" to imagine that you're making similar conclusions about other parts of animal behavior, but the reality is that it's JUST as silly as the conclusions you've already drawn. The reason you think one is silly and the other isn't is because you agree with one and don't agree with the other. ""Men and women must be inherently different because look at how apes behave"" is just as silly as ""Settled agricultural society must be bad because look at how apes behave"" or ""Nuclear families must be bad because look at how apes behave"". You either think animals are a guide for behavior or you don't.

> You can't possibly argue we aren't still connected to our pre-agricultural heritage...we aren't outside of nature, we are still essentially connected to it and part of it.

Yes, we aren't ""outside of nature"", which is why it's ridiculous to argue that we need to act more like apes or compare ourselves to them. Humans *are* natural. Our behavior is always going to be natural because we are part of nature. So arguing that we need to admit that we're like chimpanzees because chimpanzees are ""more natural"" is a non-argument. Transgender identities are natural because the humans that do it are part of nature. Equalizing gender is natural because the humans that do it are part of nature. It should be very obvious that the ""natural"" society that humans have constructed ""naturally"" has no resemblance to the society of apes or early humans. Again, you are picking and choosing which parts of ""nature"" you want to emulate because it suits your personal purposes.

>I'm saying men and women are different, you're saying they aren't. I don't think you can say that because of reasons I've laid out. You're saying it is true that we aren't different because????

The ""reasons you've laid out"" are largely dishonest or oversimplified. I'm saying we're not different because (a) the tasks that our society requires us to do are *not* the same as the tasks required for hunter-gatherers, and (b) the variance between individuals of the same gender is generally just as much as the ostensible difference between genders.

For a guy who claims he was just arguing that ""men and women are different"" you sure are going deep into this argument. I've laid out what I think. I don't think there's a reason to continue talking to you about it.",Kirbyoto,t2_6x4qg,0,0,reddit4

Well we now actually have experiments where we do deal with the quantum mechanics and the elementary particles, and then those that make up those particles. We also have done much in regards to statistical measurement of those particles to come up with equations that now explain electron clouds.

So science has moved beyond what heisenbug conceived of back to objective observation.

I'm surprised you still don't differentiate methodologically between kinds of facts. If you've read pragmatism it should be clear that it's useful to distinguish between social facts, brute facts, and hybrid facts. 

With this, it's no longer about 'objective' per se, but rather on the usefulness of theories. 

I don't know about you, but for my field, political science, it seems fruitless to pursue epistemological questions of 'truth or 'objectivity'. Hence, it's more fruitful to adopt epistemological pragmatism and evolutionary epistemology, accepting the contingency of 'truth'. Though, if you're a philosophy student then of course this is relevant. 

&#x200B;

> theories create the world 

Assuming an individualist ontology, there is a world that we can discover 'out there'. This means that we can create theories and apply them with an accepted methodology and seek truths and laws, under say the correspondence theory of truth. 

However, if we adopt a social ontology and assume what is known out there to be as a result of localised structures of meaning (created by societies), then this implies that our theories do more than just analyse the world, they're also creating it. This should place the scientist in a precarious position, it directly contradicts what they're supposed to be doing. This is where the post-Marxists and poststructuralists come in, who want to challenge these foundations of meaning.

Hence, if we include the role of discourse into our ontology, then the idea of what we are finding become problematic, is it 'true' because it has an essence, or is it only true because we believe it to be? 

It seems your position is a social ontology combined with an individualist theory of knowledge, which should be evidently precarious. 

&#x200B;

>If you ever pursue a PhD, I'd wager you'll lose this mindset very fast on your first interdisciplinary higher seminar.

I'm just concerned you have misinterpreted (or maybe I presented it badly) where I stand. I'm way more apathetic than a positivist, if we wanna use jargon, I tend to pursue constructivist pragmatism. So, it's less about 'truth' and more about use. It becomes less about finding transcendental truths, as it is exploring and advancing useful theories while embracing their contingency.

Science is more about the scientific method (hypothesis based and replicability) to me than theory per se. 

Let's contextualize what I mean. I'm a linguist, and here's an example of how ""truth"" can be anything but objective. 

Take the phrase ""I don't understand, what do you mean?"". If respondents hear this in the guise of an old person, they will perceive the old person as being 'confused', while if they listen to it when said by a young person, they perceive the 'issue as more complex' (see Giles et al. 1990). The same syntactic construct ""I don't understand, what do you mean?"" can be perceived very differently based on context. So what is the 'objective reality' of that perception? 

Taking that a step further and trying to create a theory around that social interpretation, linguistics (and social psychologists I suppose) have developed the linguistic stereotyping hypothesis which explains the phenomenon. But in that phenomenon and hypothesis, meaning is inherently based on social constructs. 


So again, if we backpedal a bit to where we were talking about gender norms and interests. See how a theory can explain that behaviour, and not how the theory shapes the behaviour? The theory tries to explain the phenomenon, but the behaviours are changing (while the phenomenon is constant). Thus, there isn't anything non-scientific in saying that social constructs shape our interests. 


And going beyond that and segue back to me and my view of science. I'm personally utterly uninterested in the development of theory. I care about method development and applied linguistics. I couldn't care less really about whether a person follows the Chomsky way of linguistics, or if they're more of a language in use person (which I am, I suppose). 

And it's personal bias I suppose, but I don't think a scientist working with methodological development and applied sciences is any less of a 'scientist' than someone focusing on theory.",Broweser,t2_qgh06,1,0,reddit4

I've seen many papers on vaccines against long covid. For hospitalization it makes a massive difference. For long covid, many papers have found the differences between vaccinated and not to be not very substantial besides one.

j2agnst,t1_j28aper,2022-12-30 20:37:02,science,"There's kinda three ways of dealing with pain medically.  Make the pain go away, make the person not care about the pain they feel, and make the person feeling the pain forget that it's actually them feeling pain.

Chemically there are the three main types

Painkillers: like NSAIDs so ibuprofen etc. and opioids like morphine or oxycodone

Sedatives: things like Valium, Xanax, and to a lesser extent opioids also fit into this category

Dissociatives: that's a drug that dissociates you from yourself and depending on the drug either from just your body, just your sense of self, or both.  This is things like PCP, some cold medicines when taken at recreational doses, DMT, some other hallucinogens, and nitrous or laughing gas.  Yes PCP and that stuff dentist's give to children are in the same category of drug.

PCP was actually originally developed as a form of general anesthesia, they gave it to people and then did surgery on them, anything from minor surgeries to major internal surgeries, with the person fully awake and aware, and yet they just didn't care.  Because to them it wasn't them feeling that it was some guy, they were just a disembodied consciousness often with little to no sense of self watching it.  They stopped trials because PCP is an incredibly powerful stimulant and they kept having problems with patients getting up and or attacking surgeons during surgery.  If they don't fear consequences because it isn't them doing it, can't be affected by pain, are amped up on drugs and made hyper aggressive it's easy to see the violence that results from it.  PCP also builds up in fat tissue and can be released later leading to the person possibly getting that effect again randomly later without warning.  Though I haven't read the Wikipedia page recently so take this last part with a grain of salt.

I also have read and have personal experience that agrees with that that some stimulants like ADHD meds can increase pain tolerance too, especially for pain from physical exertion or injury.  It doesn't reduce the pain, it doesn't make you not care, and you are fully present within your body.  It just makes you care more about whatever it is you're doing than the pain.  It's affecting the same systems that would be activated by getting attacked by a mountain lion or seeing some crazy person run up behind you and grabbing your kid and running off with them.

You're gonna run really hard discomfort be damned, and strangle that mountain lion with your bare hands after getting clawed up and mauled, then walk ten miles back to safety.

Anyways, tangent over.",Alistair_TheAlvarian,t2_5ccp80yx,2,0,reddit2

People drinking less while in work will often be because they literally don't want to go into work hungover and cannot afford to lose their job by having drink related days off.

Waking up well rested and ready to be productive for the day instead of hung over. Why don't they have a way of drug testing that can just tell if you're high at the time of whatever incident/random test just happened. I hope this comes soon after the widespread acceptance of recreational marijuana because the current testing is ridiculous!

cyp34cr,t1_cyooi7t,2016-01-07 06:48:01,science,"Yes and no. The Great Recession ended in June of 2009 and the economy has been growing for many years (the mark of a recession is a contracting economy) but the growth has been generally slow and not spread terribly equally.

In particular, wage growth has been anemic and job growth solid but slower than one would expect but returns to capital have been tremendous. The result of this is that if you lost a large proportion during the recession, for instance if most of your wealth was in your house, which is the case for most Americans)and especially so for black Americans) and your house lost a lot of it's value then you had nothing to invest with. There have been very large gains in the stock market since the end of the recession, for example, but the only people who were able to take advantage of it were those who still had enough wealth to invest in the stock market post recession. These people probably lost a lot of money in absolute terms during the downturn, but less in proportion to their total wealth than others.

People who lost a large proportion of their wealth were less able to take advantage of these gains and had to make do with the relatively lower wages they were making, assuming they had a job. The consequence of this is that most everyone lost a lot, but in the recovery those who were already wealthier have seen their wealth skyrocket, leading to a large increase in inequality.

It's worth pointing out at this time that inequality is not, in and of itself, a bad thing. If everyone had the ability to buy a million dollars worth of goods (so if everyone had a million dollars and inflation weren't a thing) except one guy who could buy hundreds of trillions, that would be very unequal in an absolute sense but generally fine because every single person would have a high standard of living, even if one guy's were outrageous.

The reason the Great Recession doesn't feel like it's over is because that is not the case. People who lost everything still have't fully recovered and while unemployment is reaching it's lowest sustainable level, wages are only now beginning to rise. 

Interestingly, this makes the economy (at least that of the U.S) more volatile in general, but less responsive to specific shocks. For instance, if the price of oil tripled tomorrow, people living near the poverty line would hurt badly, and they would alter their behavior to drive less, but they would still have to drive places so it wouldn't change that much, and the very wealthy probably wouldn't alter their behavior much because the impact would be a smaller proportion of their income. 

However, if wealth is concentrated among only a few people or groups, than any changes in the fortunes of a given person or group is going to have an outsize effect on the wealth of the economy as a whole.",DCdictator,t2_6wt5i,1,0,reddit3

Effectively what this involved was pumping cash into the economy in order to stimulate investment. One way they could do this was through buying up commercial debt in order to pump cash into the economy (I buy a $1000 Commercial Bank bond from you, and give you cash for it) this theoretically increases the supply of money, and therefore with a greater supply of money, the cost of it (interest rates) go down. With the cost of money going down, the ease of financing and therefore the viscosity of money flow through the economy should increase. This should theoretically create positive effects in the economy through investment and consumer spending.

The Fed (the monetary policy institution of the US - which acts independently) has attempted to prevent another recession through engaging in QE. Whether or not you agree with QE is another matter.

If I'm not reflecting poorly on my employer, and simply drinking at home without it affecting my work performance, my employer wouldn't know, nor would they have reason to know or inquire. 

That said, my employer has a drug policy that indicates if drugs are found in your system during a random drug test (or at the beginning of employment when there is a mandatory drug screen), then the positive test for drugs constitutes being ""under the influence"" even if no behavior difference is apparent. So if you smoke weed and a drug test shows THC in your system -- even many days later -- they can fire you for cause. And they of course also have a clause that allows for them to fire you for *any* reason, or no reason at all.

Day-drinking is normal for lawyers, for example. But during a major recession, networking may be less important than being seen at the office or being available for clients.

And there are a lot of programmers who honestly believe (with good reason, in some cases) that they do certain kinds of tasks better when they're a little buzzed. They might take some beer to work or their work to some beer. In a normal economy, this works out fine for them because employers will bend over backwards to make their programmers happy.

Raising compliance costs -> higher overhead -> requires larger overall revenue to maintain a fixed profit margin. 

>Business naturally consolidates

Is that why we've never seen a monopoly that was not a product of a government? 

>Regulation has made it more difficult to operate in certain industries, but it has not prevented it.

It has *raised the costs of operation* which *increased the overhead of operating the business* which *drove market consolidation to efficiently allocate capital in that sector*, which resulted in ""too big to fail"" banks. 

If costs of compliance were lower, there would be more banks of smaller sizes, and thus none would be systemically important.

Not impossible, *less capital efficiency*. Higher compliance costs mean that your overhead is greater, which means your profits are lower. These are extremely basic, simple accounting relationships. It's like asking for a ""source"" for the alphabet. 

Having a lower margin because of a high fixed cost is an incentive to grow the overall revenues to amortize the fixed cost across a greater revenue base and raise the relative profit margin.

That's exactly why heavily regulated businesses are dominated by oligopolies. Regulation is the *cause* of consolidation, and so increasing regulation is counterproductive to the interest of reducing consolidation. ",ChaosMotor,t2_2ynyt,1,0,reddit3

dfbc1y5,t1_dfau4uw,2017-03-23 17:34:50,science,"As a quick summary: Different photo-voltaic materials will lead to a specific voltage jump if photons with enough energy hit them. Photons with less energy will do nothing, photons with more energy will still only give that identical energy boost.

For your typical silicon panels this voltage jump is at a location where you can only get around 29% return from normal sunlight, based on the photons that will do nothing and the photons that will have extra energy wasted.

However you can layer multiple different photo-voltaic materials together. The idea is that the higher energy photons can hit the higher voltage jump materials, so that (some of) their extra energy can actually be used. The photons that are too low energy for the first material pass through to hit the second material, and so on and so forth.

Edit: I should state that these solar panels aren't used in terrestrial applications (at least widespread) because they are typically a lot more expensive to manufacture.

Solar cells get more efficient the hotter they are (which is completely bonkers) but their overall output goes down due to internal losses increasing faster than input. This leads to solar panels melting quite easily, if you continue to ramp up the input power.

Super high efficiencies of 40%+ are achieved by actively cooling the panel so it doesn't melt and by concentrating 100-1000x normal solar intensity onto the panel, in addition to having multiple types of solar panels stacked on top of each other (one for long wavelengths, one for medium wavelengths, and one for short wavelengths, maybe more, maybe less) that is to say, not things you would see on a rooftop panel.

If space is not an issue, you could use cells with half the efficiency and still be cost effective as long as they are less than half the cost per area of more efficient cells.

Though inverters aren't 100% efficient, they're very nearly that. SMA's Sunny Boy 3000TL is 97.6% efficient, for instance.

Transmission losses are trivial for residential solar because the power is being produced a few feet from where it's used. Grid power has significant losses through transmission lines and HV equipment.

dfbbfyp,t1_dfaykcn,2017-03-23 17:23:46,science,"That's not how layers work. A semiconductor junction, or where two SC materials meet, has ""energy bandgap"" that is determined by the composition. For example, silicon cells have a different bandgap than Gallium Arsenide. Energy bandgaps are related to quantum mechanics so I won't really go into it but the practical application is that a solar cell can absorb photons to make energy as long as the energy in that photon is greater than the bandgap.

That's an important point so let me reiterate it. For a silicon cell to produce electricity when it gets hit by photons those photons need to have a higher energy than silicone energy bandgap. When a photon hits the silicon it excites an electron. If the electron gets excited higher‚Äã than the bandgap it is ""freed"" and produces voltage AKA electricity.

A *multijunction* solar cell is where you have many different SCs, each with a different band gap. We stack them on top of each other so we can maximize how many photons we can absorb. All photons are not born equal. The energy in a photon is determined by it's wavelength. Our sun puts out some wavelengths more than others. On earth we have much more green light than other kinds of light so panels that target that range will make more electricity (well, they will have more photons. It's also about efficiency, energy per photon, etc.). We build the multijunction cells to try and maximize how much of this spectrum we can absorb.

Really cool tangent: because the sun puts out some wavelengths more than others there is a maximum efficiency you can have a lightbulb while still making it look like a white light. If you see an LED bulb with an efficiency above 760 Watts they are probably putting extra green in the light! Green is more efficient than some of the other colors‚Äã (due to wavelength) and our eyes respond to green light more than others because it's the most common so a manufacturer can put extra green in and make a brighter bulb for less power, but it will be green.

Yes, that's technically true. However, tens of thousands will die living in a shelter somewhere because their family farms, lands, and homes are now in a quarantine zone that will last for decades, and in some cases, forever because there just isn't a way to clean some things up. Also, most of Japan is recovered or recovering from the tsunami, but their economy is going to suffer from this one facility's poor engineering decisions for a century or more.

Just because it's a good idea in the perfect world of paper doesn't mean it's a good idea in real life, where real life things tend to go wrong.

The decision to not build the Daichii facility immune from a R9 earthquake and the resultant tsunami was an economic one, they made a bet they wouldn't experience such a quake and tsunami in the 30-40 year lifetime of the plant and they lost that bet. So did a hundred thousand other people. Large areas contaminated by Fukushima weren't even affected by the tsunami, and only marginally affected by the quake.

Japan has a well-documented history of major earthquakes and tsunamis going back fifteen hundred years:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historical_tsunamis

It differs depending on where you live, but a 1 watt solar panel will produce something like 1400 watt-hours a year of energy (more sunny places produce more). Seeing how a kwh is about a dime, that is about $0.15 worth of electricity a year per watt of solar panels.

One of the main reasons, it that they GC methodologies used most frequently, are not measuring the acid forms of the cannabinoids, which can represent > 90% of the total cannabinoid concentration within a cannabis sample.  Upon injection into the GC, the acid forms of the cannabinoids are decarboxylated, changing the true composition of your sample even before the analysis begins.

But I will take a stab.  The plants grow very differently, they look different, and they have very different physiological effects.  However, I have tested several many plants with varying degree of hybridization, and I often do not see huge differences in the cannabinoid profiles.  This tells me it is not solely the cannabinoid profiles that are responsible for the differences between the strains and the effects.  There has been a great deal of interest in the terpenes and how they modulate the effects of marijuana.  For instance, the terpene mycene has been reported to increase the uptake of THC, increasing the intensity and and duration of the ""high"", while the terpene linalool is reported to increase the level of lethargy or drowsiness.

1)We are still waiting for states that require analytical testing to issue some sort of permit to the laboratory technicians that enable them to handle, process and test marijuana.  In the mean time, like many of the laboratories around the county, all of our employees have to have a Medical Marijuana Card.
2) For consumer safety, there are multiple facets.  One of the most important would be to ensure that products are free from contaminants such as pesticides, heavy metals, mold and fungus.  While many of these contaminants can be tolerated by a healthy individual, for a patient that is in any way immune compromised (e.g. on chemotherapy), these contaminants could be lethal.  The other aspect is for dosing.  We see this is especially critical for determining the proper dosing for children which are suffering from epilepsy or other seizure disorders.  
Currently our analyses have focused on the cannabinoid profiles, but we have also been performing analyses on terpenes and some pesticides.  We are also gearing up to provide heavy metal and microbiological testing, with the identification of mycotoxins (from mold and fungus).  As we continue to grow, we will continue to expand our testing services.

There are several techniques to determine THC, which lie somewhere on the spectrum of qualitative to quantitative.  The most basic technique, would be TLC.  It can give a quick glimpse of the cannabinoids present, and can give you somewhat of an idea of relative concentrations.  Conventional liquid chromatographic techniques can give a much more precise identification and quantitation of the cannabinoids present.  Modern instrumentation is much more sensitive and can determine lower levels with greater precision and accuracy.  the most modern chromatographic techniques can analyze samples faster and more efficiently, enabling higher throughput, and at a reduced cost per sample (although the instrumentation cost up front is greater).
For sample quantities, to get an idea of cannabinoid profile, we have been able to work with a sample as small as a 10 mg sample of fresh leaf.  
There is a great deal of information on testing on the internet.  I would also recommend a publication by the American Herbal Pharmacopoeia, ""Cannabis Inflorescence"", which is a very nice summary of available analytical testing techniques.",chrishudalla_ACS,t2_fzknm,7,0,reddit1

I believe the simplest technique would be TLC.  However, the ability to quantitate any compound using TLC is limited.  Other chromatographic techniques such as HPLC offer much greater precision and reproducibility.  Precision and reproducibility are not the same as accuracy, but HPLC is very accurate given a detector with good dynamic range and a standard curve.  The newer HPLC options such as UPLC allow very fast and repetitive analyses, so the sample throughput is very high with good reproducibility.  Using this approach the detection limit for THC is in the range of 5 ppm in most matrices; lower if using mass spec detection.  

The confidence in results is high; we routinely calculate confidence limits.  There are procedures in the scientific literature - try googling ""quantitative HPLC analysis of THC in (matrix)"".

ch8kyz2,t1_ch6bmie,2014-05-03 16:17:04,science,"Yes.  Much of the research that has been done show that the different cannabinoids have different properties.  For instance, CBD is a cannabinoid that has gained a great deal of interest lately, because it is believed to have some very interesting medicinal properties, but WITHOUT the psychoactivity of THC.  Most of the patients we are dealing with have NO desire to get ""stoned"", they are looking for relief of their symptoms with out that. ",chrishudalla_ACS,t2_fzknm,2,0,reddit1
ch8li7d,t1_ch80srm,2014-05-03 16:40:35,science,"I am not convinced that consuming marijuana reduces the ""high"", although the onset would be slower.  When smoking, or vaping, the cannabinoids are entering the blood stream very rapidly.  When consuming as a food product, the psychoacitive THC is metabolized by the liver to 11-hydroxy-THC.  It is a much slower process for it to enter the system, but it is believed that the 11-hydroxy-THC actually has greater psychoactivity than normal THC, in addition to having slightly different effects.
While I cannot speak to this from my own experience, I have been told that for equal doses of cannabinoid, while smoked vs ingested, the ingested cannabinoid will produce a greater ""high"".  In addition to difference in how the body processes the THC, when smoking, some of the THC can be degraded from combustion prior to entering the lungs.   Would love to see more research done in this area to understand this better.....",chrishudalla_ACS,t2_fzknm,2,0,reddit1

If you guys are wondering why your egg prices are through the roof it‚Äôs because chicken farms cannot keep up with neither production nor (more importantly) preventing disease spread by depopulating infected flocks. The recommended and more humane feasible method for large scale depopulation is via foam based suffocation as it is the fastest way to kill en masse which is mentioned in the paper to its credit. The recent outbreak has constrained the ability of the USDA and state governments to keep up with depopulation for AI-positive flocks. This article does not fully weigh the risk of an immediate food supply chain disruption should depopulation cease and AI spread to every farm as would happen. The ethics the authors ought to discuss instead is not that of the veterinary profession (since the obvious and normally followed guideline by the AVMA and USDA is foam) but rather of a system that relies on industrial agriculture, and likewise to human disease outbreak, does not adequately stockpile the supplies and infrastructure necessary to deal with inevitable highly pathogenic outbreaks.",Clever_Userfame,t2_ocyze,60,0,reddit2

j4k3w7g,t1_j4hj7lr,2023-01-16 07:06:55,science,"As a farmer, I can tell you what my Land Grant University taught me in Ag School in the 70s. It is the economics of scale. Doing it this way reduces labor costs, and allows you do raise more and more animals on less land. Raising pigs this was just getting underway when I was in college. During that time confinement pigs often produced 'pale watery pork'. The scientists discovered that putting a 5 gallon bucket of plain old field dirt in the pens 'cured' the issue. The pigs would snuffle some up.. not like pica, where something is irresistable but not nutritive.. and their meat would be desireable. When you read that the number of farms has decreased by 90% over the last 20 years, this is why. One farmer can tend pig barns all day, and raise thousands of pigs at a time, instead of the old way of field raising them, and having hired help.  The farmers in the pig factories and chicken factories wear decontamination suits, and step in a foot bath on their way in and out of the barns, to try to reduce contamination. I think a lot of the megaproducers are owned by foreign interests. I know several of the pork brands, like Smithfield Hams, are owned by Chinese investors now.

If you live anywhere near 'the country', patronize the local farmers' market. Find a local source for your  meat and eggs. Opt out of this cruel crazy method of creating flesh for consumption. Local producers don't have to use the insane amounts of antibiotics the packed house boys do. We don't usually have animals with deformities caused by overcrowding. The first time I finished some feeder pigs on pasture I was shocked at how much better it tasted. Even though it looked like it had more fat, it didn't cook out. We cut porkchops with our forks.

j4hqedb,t1_j4ge0sr,2023-01-15 20:30:51,science,"I used to date a farm inspector who's job was to do animal welfare and code enforcement checks for agriculture. She basically said the bird flu call outs were the worst and wound up with everybody from the state in mandatory therapy. From what I recall policy was that after foaming, anything still moving in the barn was killed by boot or shovel before piled up and burned or buried. The state came in to verify complete eradication of an entire farms population to reduce the risk of a widespread outbreak. This often meant killing birds that the foam didn't get to. 

Since then, I understand the protocol has changed and there are fumigation options now that are less destructive.  Unfortunately foam is one of the most viable options for killing thousands of birds at once. Other cost effective chemical options have the risk of poisoning non-target animals outside of the target area or have other negative environmental risks. 

From what I've seen in agriculture,  this is basically everybodies worst nightmare.

j4gurjy,t1_j4ge0sr,2023-01-15 17:15:12,science,"> the people that get involved in killing animals as their career choice are probably not the most empathetic people on the planet.

I'll remind everyone here that factory farm workers have very high turnover rate, and even worse, very high suicide rates. Some of the highest of all professions. Mental health problems with farmers and factory farm workers is a huge problem. 

Besides that, you're comparing three very different things here. The veterinary industry (Which I've worked in for a long time) to commercial factory conditions to a punitive and indeed vindictive justice system. The only reason your veterinarians use extra chemicals and ensure your pet is sedated and comfortable is because as a society we care about our pets and spend several hundred dollars on their end-of-life care and expect it to be as merciful and gentle as possible.

On a factory farm, people are required to move massive amounts of ""product"" every day. They wouldn't use anything that consumes any resources if they could help it, and in fact many times people working the killing floor have to work with defective or malfunctioning captive bolt guns, or perform sloppy shots and animals end up suffering greatly and sometimes even butchered while still aware.

As for the criminal ""justice"" system, I have nothing against removing monstrous and dangerous people from the world if proven that they're guilty and beyond reform, but we'd be delusional to not accept that the system is still so rough simply because nobody is going to introduce legislation to spend taxpayer money on humane nitrogen chambers or other methods of fast, painless and reliable execution. That would be political suicide for anyone involved.

I mean it could be used to torture, sure, but because you would use the word torture in the sentence to describe it, by your logic it's not, right?

Or are you really going to lean on the ""some people find pain pleasurable so nothing is ultimately torture""? Because that's what you're saying, you're saying forcibly preventing a creature from breathing, its very most important and primary instinct, that every creature understands is necessary, is not torture?

Like every single animal on the planet will freak out if you suddenly plug its mouth and nose, but I guess that's for a different reason than the anxiety and durress caused by the suffocation. Yeah that's it, surely the suffocation is just incidental, it's something else entirely that's causing them to go through all the feelings of what being tortured means. 

Go back to cutting open live rats or w.e. tf you're into. That's not torture either, right, if you're not doing it to hurt them?
