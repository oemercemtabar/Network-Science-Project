You can ask me anything about regulatory toxicology, the science behind most environmental and occupational exposure scenarios.","[ACS AMA](http://imgur.com/hoKm4RT)

Hi Reddit! My name is Hans Plugge and I am a toxicologist with over 35 years’ experience working on contract both for government, including USEPA, as well as private industry.  Currently I work at 3E Company in their Bethesda, Maryland office, focusing on regulatory toxicology. During most of my career I have specialized in hazard and risk assessment of complex environmental scenarios. Recently I have done a fair amount of work in so-called green toxicology, the art and science of assessing chemicals as to their “greenness”.


Previous government contract experience ranged from review of nasal carcinogens, particulate matter and teratogens to ecotoxicological impacts from drilling muds. Non-federal government/ industry experience ranged from city government (municipal sludge disposal) to state governments (monitoring lab and Superfund activities) to commercial real estate (sick building syndrome, site re-development and asbestos remediation) to (big) data analysis and QC.  At 3E Company, my industry work includes developing GreenScore, hazard assessment software for Green Toxicology, developing and maintaining over a hundred databases of (eco)toxicological data as well as consultations with industry.


I have a B.Sc. in Chemistry from the University of Amsterdam, Netherlands and Master’s degrees in Environmental Biochemistry from the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada and in Toxicology from the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston. I have been with 3E Company for 3 years, prior to that I was a private consultant for 30 years.


Again I am Hans Plugge, a Senior Toxicologist with 3E Company in Bethesda, MD.  You can ask me anything about regulatory toxicology, the science behind environmental and occupational exposure scenarios.

I am a chemist, a materials chemist by training. After my BA, MA and DPhil degrees in Oxford I spent nearly two years doing neutron scattering research in the Physics Department of Tohoku University in Japan. Deciding then to come to the US, I had to decide first between an academic or industrial track. Choosing the latter, I joined ExxonMobil Corporate Research in New Jersey, where I was fortunate to be able to work on inorganic materials for a range of interesting applications, including ceramics, catalysts, zeolites, and oxide superconductors. I got interested in computer simulation and was then recruited by Biosym Technologies, a molecular simulation software company in San Diego. I had various executive roles, including Chief Scientific Officer, as the company was acquired by Corning, merged with Molecular Simulation, and was acquired by Pharmacopeia (now [Biovia DS](http://accelrys.com/)). I then became more interested in start-up and early phase companies, co-founding [FreedomVoice Systems](https://www.freedomvoice.com/), [hte AG](http://www.hte-company.com/en), fqubed, Integrated Discovery Sciences, Bio4Front and, in 2011, Tioga Research.


I also serve as an [ACS Expert](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/experts/john-newsam.html) an AAAS Fellow and a RSC Fellow; I enjoy teaching entrepreneurship to undergraduates at UCSD and discussing with local middle- and high-schoolers interested in chemistry.

I study the chemistry of planetary materials in our solar system and those around other stars. I am interested in the chemistry and mineralogy of asteroids and comets. I study these objects using planet formation theories, meteorite analysis, and spacecraft missions. 

I am in charge of NASA’s [OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return Mission](http://www.asteroidmission.org) as Principal Investigator. OSIRIS-REx is a space mission to visit asteroid [Bennu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101955_Bennu), one of the most potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids. OSIRIS-REx will survey Bennu to assess its impact hazard and resource potential, understand its geology, and return a sample to Earth. We launch in 2016, rendezvous with Bennu in 2018, and return to Earth in 2023.

Also, I invite everyone to send your name into space on the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft through our [Messages to Bennu](http://www.planetary.org/get-involved/messages/bennu/) campaign. Feel free to check out my blog [Life on the Asteroid Frontier](http://dslauretta.com/) as well!

**Edit** Thanks for the great AMA. I have to get back to work but will keep answering your questions throughout the day!

**Edit#2** Thanks for the continued interest! I am going out for a beer but will answer your questions when I get back - they may get more interesting after that . . .

**Edit#3** Answers to FAQs:

- What do I think about asteroid mining?

Asteroids like Bennu represent natural resources of near-Earth space, in the form of water, organics, and precious metals. There is potential for substantial economic development in follow-on exploration of these objects. Water and organics are useful for life support and rocket fuel and therefore would support a space-faring economy. The current business model for asteroid mining relies on a steady customer base for resources such as water and organic compounds in space. Such a venture may be feasible if international interest in space exploration continues to increase. Another angle on asteroid mining is to extract precious metals like platinum and return them to Earth. I calculate that a 10-meter asteroid is worth ~$10-million, with $9M in iron, nickel, and cobalt and $1M worth of platinum. Given that OSIRIS-REx costs $1-billion, we have long way to go before this business plan closes. What we really need to do is bring down the cost of accessing space. 


There are a couple of companies that are interested in asteroid mining and they are looking for talented people. If you are interested, they are hiring.

- What are the chances of finding a harmful bacteria/virus in the sample?

We consider this to be a very low probability event. We don’t expect any microorganisms on Bennu. It is too small and the radiation doses would kill anything living on the asteroid in a very short time. We had to prove this as part of our Planetary Protection rating – which is Unrestricted Earth Return - meaning that we do not have to take any special precautions to avoid contaminating the Earth with extraterrestrial life. Instead, we hope to find organic molecules that may have led to the origin of life on Earth. We will focus on measuring the organic molecular inventory of the samples but don’t have any plans for biological assays. We will keep the sample under nitrogen purge to avoid contaminating it with terrestrial microbes.

- How do I get a job in planetary science or working on a spacecraft mission?

I  describe my initial steps in my [Journey to the Asteroid Frontier - Part 1](http://dslauretta.com/2013/12/06/my-journey-to-the-asteroid-frontier-part-1/) in one of my blog posts with a follow on in [Part 2](http://dslauretta.com/2013/12/17/my-journey-to-the-asteroid-frontier-part-2/). I was introduced to planetary science as an undergraduate at the University of Arizona when I received a NASA Undergraduate Research Space Grant to work on the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. The idea of communicating with an alien civilization across the vast expanse of space inspired me to pursue a career in planetary science. I focus on the formation of planets and the origin of life to understand the likelihood of alien life arising and evolving elsewhere in our universe.

As for young people wanting to get into this line of work - study hard and do well in school. Graduate high school and go to college. Find people with similar interests. Start with the basics – math and physics, then work your way up from there. Planetary science is multidisciplinary and requires knowledge of math, physics, chemistry, geology, biology, etc. Once in college, he should try to get a job in a research lab. Talk to scientists and engineers that are working on projects that interest and find ways to volunteer in their labs. Undergraduate research opportunities are key to getting needed experience for a job in the aerospace industry or for getting into a good graduate school. Be persistent, arrange for tours of local labs, and make it clear that you are interested and motivated to pursue a career in this field. Once you get the job, do it well and show initiative to move up to more responsibility.

I am optimistic about the future of space exploration for several reasons. First, despite budget cuts in recent years, the United States has a great space program with many exciting missions in the future including Mars 2020, the Europa Clipper, and, of course, OSIRIS-REx. In addition, other national space agencies are ramping up their programs including India, China, Russia, and the Europeans. Finally, I think we are starting to see some serious interest from industry in commercial development of space. If these companies take off then planetary scientists will be in high demand.

- What powers and propels OSIRIS-REx towards Bennu and how fast does it travel?

We have two solar arrays to provide power to the spacecraft. We have two Li-ion batteries to store power for periods when we are not in direct sunlight (such as during launch and sampling). The guidance system includes many components including star trackers, sun sensors, a laser range-finder, and on-board image processing capabilities. 
I describe the journey to Bennu, including details on the speeds involved in my blog post [How to Get to Bennu and Back](http://dslauretta.com/2013/11/27/how-to-get-to-bennu-and-back/). We will leave Earth with a hyperbolic escape velocity of 5.4 km/s (over 12,000 mph) on an Atlas V rocket. We will sneak up on Bennu with a relative approach velocity of 20 cm/s (~0.45 mph). When we return to Earth the sample return capsule will hit the top of the atmosphere with a speed of 12.4 km/s (27,738 mph). 

- How much sample will we collect, what do we hope to find in the asteroid sample and how will we analyze it?

The baseline science requirement is 60 grams (about 2 ounces) of asteroid regolith. However, we also have to be able to measure the amount of sample collected before we stow the sample collector in the return capsule. We measure the moment of inertia of the spacecraft both before and after sample acquisition. It turns out that this technique has a measurement uncertainty of 90 grams (3-sigma). Therefore, our sample collector (TAGSAM) is required to pick up 150 grams of material. Under optimum conditions, TAGSAM can pick up two kilograms of material. We have the capability to attempt sample collection three times. However, we hope to get enough sample on the first attempt. The second two are backup options in case the first attempt does not pick up enough material. 

The primary objective of OSIRIS-REx is to return pristine carbonaceous material from the early Solar System. Spectral analysis of Bennu suggests that it is similar on composition to the very rare CI and CM carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. These rocks are rich in organic compounds and water-bearing minerals like clays. We hope to find organic molecules that may have led to the origin of life on Earth and inform the likelihood that life may have originated elsewhere in our solar system. The team’s sample analysis objectives are distributed among five broad categories, based on analytical techniques. These are: mineralogy & petrology, elemental & isotopic composition, organic chemistry, spectral properties, and thermal properties. We use a wide variety of techniques including NanoSIMS, transmission electron microscopy, electron microprobe analysis, mass spectroscopy, gas and liquid chromatography, synchrotron particle accelerators, thermal conductivity analyzers, and laboratory spectrometers.

We are computer scientists and ethicists who are examining the societal, ethical, and labor market implications of increasing automation due to artificial intelligence. 
	

Autonomous robots, self-driving cars, drones, and facial recognition devices already are affecting people’s careers, ambitions, privacy, and experiences. With machines becoming more intelligent, many people question whether the world is ethically prepared for the change.  Extreme risks such as killer robots are a concern, but even more so are the issues around fitting autonomous systems into our society.


We’re seeing an impact from artificial intelligence on the labor market.  You hear about the Google Car—there are millions of people who make a living from driving like bus drivers and taxi drivers. What kind of jobs are going to replace them?

My name is Alex Tullo. I am a senior correspondent with the Northeast News Bureau at Chemical & Engineering News. I have been reporting on the chemical industry for C&EN since 1999.  I have headed C&EN’s coverage of DuPont’s merger with Dow Chemical since this deal was [unveiled in December](http://cen.acs.org/articles/93/i49/Introducing-DowDuPont.html) and have had particular focus on the impact this deal will have on research.
This merger surprised the chemical world. Both companies together, when the merger was announced, combined for a market capitalization of $130 billion. No previous chemical deal had ever even topped $20 billion in value. The new DowDuPont will generate an estimated $83 billion in annual sales, second only among chemical makers to BASF. 


This company won’t last for long. In about two years after its formation, management plans to break DowDuPont apart into three firms. One company will combine Dow’s and DuPont’s complementary businesses in seeds and crop protection chemicals. Another, likely headquartered in Midland, Mich., like Dow, will focus on plastics and other materials. A third, specialty products company, will be based in Wilmington, Del., like DuPont, and will have a portfolio of electronic materials and other value-added products.


The merger has already [had an impact on research](http://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i4/DuPont-Shrunk-Central-Research-Unit.html). Last month, DuPont shut down its famous Central R&D unit and is rolling it up into a much smaller organization called “Science and Innovation.”  Observers saw this as a culmination of a trend at big corporations away from exploratory research in chemistry and towards more business oriented discovery.

I will host a webinar on this topic on Feb. 11 @ 2 p.m. with Bill Nugent, a former DuPont researcher and a visiting scholar at Ohio State. http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/acs-webinars/business-entrepreneurship/research.html

We're a group of scientists and advocates who believe that the traditional genetics research model is outdated.

We need these changes to improve our ability to discover treatments and cures for diseases. But at the same time, researchers also need to ensure participant privacy, data security, and give participants the chance to weigh in on and directly benefit from research- medically, informationally, and financially. Let's discuss!

I am currently CSO of Collaborative Drug Discovery, CEO of Phoenix Nest, CEO of Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, Inc and CSO of the Hereditary Neuropathy Foundation and I am on the Editorial Board of Pharmaceutical Research.  I am a graduate (MSc, PhD, DSc) of the University of Aberdeen. I have spent 20 years working in the USA, first as a postdoc at Eli Lilly, then as a senior scientist at Pfizer and Lilly before joining smaller start-up companies. I then went on to co-found and found two rare and neglected disease companies.

My background is in clinical pharmacology, with an interest in understanding drug-drug reactions and toxicology. I quickly moved from doing bench work to learning how to use computational approaches to make predictions that could help drug discovery.

Over the years I have collaborated with different academics and companies to build models that help predict how compounds bind to enzymes, transporters, ion channels and receptors. As the datasets have grown I have applied different machine learning approaches.

My work in the last 8 years has brought me into working on neglected diseases like tuberculosis and rare diseases such as Sanfilippo syndrome and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Again collaborations are central to what I do. Virtually everything I work on is funded by a grant whether from the NIH, EU or others so even though I am not working in a university I am constantly working on small business or other grants.

Most recently my work has led to projects and collaborations on the Ebola and Zika viruses. All of this has been published openly and I am an advocate of open access publishing as well as using social media to publicize science. I believe it’s important for scientists to use tools like Twitter to tell the world about their work, conferences they are attending and publications.

I also head the Baran Laboratory, a vibrant and passionate team of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars vigorously trying to uncover Chemistry’s many hidden secrets in the pursuit of useful reactions that can simplify the way molecules are created in the lab. In a nutshell, we like to pursue problems whose solution can have a rapid impact in areas that are important to modern society such as the invention of new pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, or materials. 


Our general philosophy to making complex molecules in the laboratory has been summarized in multiple locations but suffice it to say we are aiming for syntheses that are as close to “ideal” as possible. With regards to inventing methodologies we like to focus on tangible and practical ways of forging bonds that are meaningful to as many folks as possible. In that regard, we are most enthusiastic about solving specific unmet needs in reactivity that have a high likelihood of being “translational”. Finally, we like to collaborate as much as possible with industry as the fastest return on tax payer money happens when fundamental science and real-world problems come face to face.

I work to reduce bycatch in U.S. ocean fisheries to ensure that our fisheries remain sustainable and that protected species are given their best chance to recover. What is bycatch and why does it matter? Find out here – Ask Me Anything!,"Hello Reddit! 

I'm Lee Benaka (Fishery Management Specialist, NOAA Fisheries Office of Science and Technology). While U.S. fisheries are among the world’s most sustainable, bycatch is a complex, global issue that threatens the sustainability and resiliency of our fishing communities, economies, and ocean ecosystems. NOAA Fisheries works hard to minimize bycatch in U.S. fisheries, ensuring our fisheries remain sustainable and protected species are given their best chance to recover. 

Bycatch occurs when fishermen catch and discard animals that they do not want, cannot sell, or are not allowed to keep. Discarded catch represents loss of opportunity for fishermen and too frequently, loss of marine life, which can impact vulnerable ecosystems and slow the rebuilding process for overfished stocks or place protected species at further risk. NOAA Fisheries works with fishermen, scientists, and managers to mitigate the negative effects of bycatch by developing innovative fishing gear and tracking bycatch through regular data collection. 

Bycatch is an issue that impacts the overall health of our oceans and the sustainability of our seafood industry. If you want to learn more about bycatch and how it can be reduced, this is your chance.  I'll be back at 10 am EST (7 am PST, 3 pm UTC) to answer your questions, Ask me anything!

I am cordial, well spoken and friendly. I received two offers from interviews, with the hiring managers/majority of panel members being men but unfortunately they are not companies I am very interested in.

**Two alarming trends I have noticed in tech are that being a white man is an instant negative for most companies**, especially if you find yourself in front of a panel of women or a hiring manager who is a woman. Women are also being promoted to these HM positions in much less time than their male counterparts.

**The other is underqualified women are getting these jobs that white men are competing for at increasing rates.** I checked back for the roles I was rejected for that have been filled and, unsurprisingly, all but one of them were filled by women with less experience than I have.

Just wanted to let other men (white men specifically) that are struggling know that you aren't alone. You don't meet the quotas that these companies have and you are playing against a stacked deck. This is the worst I have ever seen it, and I can only assume it will get worse. I have spoken with close friends and they are experiencing the same thing.

251,6uumes,2017-08-20,MensRights,Fuck office politics: newly arrived female coworker is in difficulty with her work and is attacking my reputation behind my back. WTF???,"The reason I post here is because many of the things this coworker does she can get away with it because she's a woman, and she's blatantly using female shaming tactics (people may not agree with the fact these are female tactics, but I think they are), *in the workplace*, to get her way...

She had a task: do her job and learn ho to do new things. Me (and others) supported her. After a few months I no longer had the obligation to support her and I realized she was slacking on purpose (facebook, amazon, chats, etc, instead of working). She... didn't like that. Because she had decided *not* to learn anything, when push came to shove and she needed to deliver, she went mad and started using the only coin at her disposal to fight the situation: social group, gossip, men-hating.

She started attacking me behind my back, trying to ruin my reputation. Her reasoning was that our boss was pressuring her to deliver, she didn't know how to do the job (spent months without applying herself) and because I was capable of doing it, *I had to drop everything for her*.

To quote her (a coworker showed me this):

- ""why doesn't Demian do it instead of me? He's the only one who knows how to do it anyway..."".
- ""I'm stuck with this, the *client* is an asshole, it's not clear what I have to do... of course it would be a lot easier if Demian supported me, but he never helps me...""
- ""this job is shit, can't do it... talk to me about your weekend :)""
- ""I asked X to give me a hand, I'm waiting for him. I watched this cool movie last night...""

Again and again, complaints in private to her friend (one of the PMs) in order to get someone to tell me to do the job *for her*. Never mentioning how she was told, when hired, that *she needed to learn this stuff*! Only implying how she's willing to do the job but my lack of support is blocking her (false and shameless accusation)...

She decided by herself that team work meant she was excempted from every responsibility. This is an example of a chat conversation:

- SHE: demian, you are not busy, right? :)
- ME: I'm busy, sorry.
- SHE: eh... you are doing research... can't you help me with this?
- ME: sorry, but I can't help you. Try to take it slowly and face one problem at a time, you'll get there.
- SHE: but I need someone to show me how it's done...
- ME: and I sent you lots of material months ago, I can't do the job for you..

She grabbed the last message and send it to four different women and a guy so they could support her in bashing me.

I had to protect myself after that. I intervened with certain coworkers and made sure my version was known. After a few days, she made so much noise and her work was so behind that my boss asked me my opinion on her and her work. 

Because of what she did (the chat convo was just one occurrence of her gossip), I sunk her in front of my boss. I spent almost 8 months without saying anything negative about a coworker (her!) in order to avoid putting her in a difficult spot, and what does she does?

She targets me because I don't go over mountains for her (where does the entitlement come from lol????) and decides to fuck with my reputation, just because she was lazy and had to choose between admitting her lack of knowledge to my bosses (damage to her image) or use social games to blame *me* instead (damage to *my* image)...

-------

Right now, I was promoted and next month I'll be in charge of her work. At the moment, she latched onto another coworker, constantly ""asking"" him how to do things, constantly ""asking"" him to look up stuff for her by saying ""she doesn't know how to do the job..."", and implying he has to because of ""team work""...

While the guy looks for stuff up, she opens her chat or facebook and starts doing random stuff or talking with her friends, waiting for him. And the spineless guy refuses to say ""no"" to her, is depressed and overloaded of work all day, and earns even less than she does...

And by the way, whenever the guy can't cope with it anymore and snaps at her, she starts gossiping behind his back telling everyone how this guy is having his ""ladies days""...

The three of us were on the same role inside the company, but unlike us, who focused on the job, she focused on her relationship with the others. At first I thought this wouldn't be an issue because we are all different, until she started using that ""support group"" she formed to backup her up on her lack of skills and all her BS...

No. He thinks ""I will go to work so my family can have warm meals today""

--------------

There is evidence of a growing number of men, who avoid women in the workplace, avoid being one on one, avoid mentoring women. This hurts women. 

https://nypost.com/2019/05/17/men-are-afraid-to-mentor-women-after-metoo-and-it-hurts-us-all-study/

I read a number of articles on that topic. Another example:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/pragyaagarwaleurope/2019/02/18/in-the-era-of-metoo-are-men-scared-of-mentoring-women/

There is a common pattern. Authors ignore and dismiss concerns of men, they give their own explanations of the experiences, feelings and motives of these men, in condescending and scolding manner and shift the topic to empowering women, defeating bias against women and improving career opportunities for women. So basically men should shut up, stop whining and do their best to help women advance. I'd say, it is basically womansplaining.

I know, that feminism is about women's issues, not about troubles of men. That's fair enough, I totally accept this approach. So let's assume these papers are supposed to fix the problem for women, defeat the backlash against metoo. However, let's see what kind of message does it deliver to these men, who are afraid of women at the workplace? 

Men aren't listened to. Their concerns and point of view are ignored. Men aren't entitled to be treated with dignity and feeling of security. Men are an instrument for the advance of  women... 

So if a man is afraid of women, he receives a message that his fears are completely valid.

\- no touching besides introductory handshakes

\- I NEVER comment on their looks, this applies for both positive and negative comments. I don't even do it when they are not around.

\- I never talk about dating or sex with/around them.

There, its that simple. I followed these rules since I started working and had 0 problems or complaints so far.

In my eyes the not following these rules is a risk not worth taking, especially for unattractive guys like myself.

I've heard my female coworkers calling guys creeps for merely attempting what I would judge to be ""corporate friendly"" and politically correct flirting. It only takes one willing to escalate things beyond gossip to ruin your livelihood.

My immediate boss was a pushy woman who did not understand the concept of boundaries. For example, she made telephone calls at all hours. I immediately make friends and one of the people I got very friendly with was a woman - we totally had no romantic interest in each other - and she acted more like a drinking buddy.

For some reason my boss did not like to see this friendship. For example every day, I had lunch with my female friend. But my boss warned both me and her that we were spending too much time together and I needed to spend time with people who were more knowledgeable in the work we were doing.

My boss started to call me over to her office on the pretense of explaining something or asking about progress on some project I was working on but she started flirting a lot and this involved her putting her hand on my thigh, near my crotch. Her language was also vulgar and amongst other things she made 'jokes' like asking me what size shoes I wore because according to her penis size is related to shoe size.

I sent her an email, copied in to our male, gay manager, outlining her behaviour and why I thought it was inappropriate.

I was horrified when I was fired but doubly so when she reported me to the police for lying about her and tarnishing her reputation! Incredibly the police are taking action against me.

Edit: Please understand that I cannot give more detailed information such as location etc. Others are asking me questions like what can the police do... etc. But I would rather not reply publicly as it might compromise my position and my future course of action. I thank you all for your support.

Reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ocxwrc/why_are_so_many_women_unaware_of_the_emotional/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), however, really set me off to writing this post.

""[Emotional labor](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/emotional-labor-in-the-workplace/202004/emotional-labor-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not) is the regulation of one’s feelings at one’s job."" Although, as acknowledged by the article linked, the meaning has been stretched to mean, ""[Women planning things.](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/)""

Both cases of ""emotional labour"" (and all other cases that include its stretched definition) have one thing in common: an abusive woman.

Picture this: You're a husband who works a job, and are trying to help around the house. Good for you, right? Except, before anything else, you'll be [berated](https://www.katykatikate.com/the-blog/2019/5/7/so-you-want-to-help-around-the-house) for not being a perfect mind-reading magician and doing so earlier. 

Then comes the fun part: Nothing you do will satisfy her. You'll be scolded and called ""incompetent"" for getting the tiniest of details wrong. You're not good enough, and you never will be. Not unless you read her mind perfectly, because she can't bother explaining things to you; she shouldn't have to.

Any confidence you had in yourself is gone, and you stop doing those things you wanted to; you always get them wrong, anyways. This is the real kicker: Now you'll be blamed for not doing enough. You're now a lazy bum, a manchild, a mama's boy. You depend on her for everything, and she can't take it, so she takes it out on you. ""I don't have to ask you to help! You should know already!"". That's the part that gets you. ""You should know already."" You should already know what she needs help doing. You should already be doing the thing. You should already know exactly how to do the thing, to the last detail. You should already know all that, and the only reason you don't is because you're not good enough.

But oh no, you're not the victim in all this; she is, because she's doing the ""emotional labour"". Stop thinking your feelings are valid; they're just a manifestation of your ""fragile male ego"" that ""needs constant appeasing"". She doesn't need to caress your ego.

in full disclosure, i'm a white male, in a creative industry that is being regulated and run by media companies with a heavy woke agenda. i've been working my way up the ladder for 15 + years now and i'm constantly seeing job offer listings with the heading ""(BIPOC) preferred."" make no mistake about it, media companies have an agenda to hire diversity. AKA, anybody but WHITE MALES.

women and people of color are being hired with no experience and being promoted up the chain overnight, something i've been working years to achieve. Further, the older white male bosses, know they're in the cross hairs and can be cancelled any minute and are terrified they are going to lose their rarified high paying job, and are as one boss told me ""making me hire"" diverse candidates, over ability, loyalty and experience.

It's not only the corporate media initiatives on the hiring side, but it's also the content - the content is all about women issues, with trans subject matter. So if you have netflix, hulu, disney, etc. you must notice that all your content is starring women and about women's issues and LBGQT subjects, etc.

Nevermind that Top Gun - an arguably patriotic, male, testosterone, action movie has done billions of dollars in GLOBAL revenue for these same companies.

You'll notice the jobs i'm speaking of are not -- plumbers, construction, electrical, truck driving, HVAC -- fields that women have no interest in, that require specialized skill and intensive labor. These are creative jobs where the only SKILL you have to have is be able to feel and relate as a woman or diverse person of color. Experience, skill be damned. The question USED TO BE ""what experience do you have?"" now the question is ""what gender and ethnicity are you?""

Further, my bosses on my last shows were ALL WOMEN (making million dollar salaries). so the notion that women are being subjugated and oppressed and dont have any mobility or opportunities, is patently false.

if i'm my own critic? hey it's social darwinism.  the times are changing, bud!  and get used to it, pal! The patriarchy is over!

but it's a tough pill to swallow. And I am angry and fed up. i'm just a guy who works his ass off and is being pushed to the back of the line because of my gender and skin color.

Women use their sexuality in work and work related settings ALL THE TIME. When they want a favor from a coworker, when they need help, when they are looking for a raise or promotion, when they are trying to get a new client/customer.

I had several dates with highly successful beautiful business women and they all laughingly admit of flirting and leading coworkers or clients/customers on in order to get that sale, promotion or just get it ""their way"". Had a date where the female CEO said if the client is a man, she sends one of her hot employees, always. And i myself -of course- over the years first hand have seen women get all girly and sexy, start using their cute girly voice when they need a favor or whatever. Its so blatant and normal, everyone knows it.

Yet women flip the fuck out when a man tries to be flirty or tries to use sexuality in their favor. They act like its an  unthinkable immoral crime that needs to be punished. If you ask women if sexuality belongs in the workplace, they all say ABSOLUTELY NOT. Yet they use it every single fucking day. Hell women told me they dress sexier for clients when they want to get a deal/sale. They flirt, they drop sexual suggestions only to later shoot the man they led on down. This all would be fine...if they weren't hypocrites that literally try to cancle and destroy men who dare to flirt back or god forbid initiate a flirt.

Coworker or customer flirts with woman at work = Oh god look at that creepy piece of shit. He should be reported and fired, this doesn't belong in the workplace.

I worked on a team with 4 other females, all counsellors/social workers/etc. On that team was a 23 year old who made her opinions about men very clear. Back in August she presented my manager with a list of things that I had said that offended her. I had no idea I was saying anything that offended her. There was about 6 things on this list, and many of them were just me expressing a different opinion than her. It was certainly never my intention to offend anyone with these opinions, and they weren't racist or sexist or derogatory. I've shown this list to many people, including many women, some of whom said they disagreed with some of my opinions, but none said they were worth complaining about. What's worse is this individual took the things I said, and twisted them, either misquoting them or taking them completely out of context, to make me look a certain way. I don't think she did this intentionally, I do believe this is what she heard me say as my words went through her filter. 

She took it to the manager, who is a female and has also demonstrated having a negative bias towards men. For this reason, I was not offered the chance to tell my side of the story; I was ignored when pointing out that I didn't say these things the way she is saying I did. I was offended, and pointed out to my manager that other people on the team, including the woman who presented this list and my manager herself, have made comments that I could have complained about should I have wanted to. My manager has also commented on my appearance more than once, which is sexual harassment, and I reminded her of this (although I didn't put it that way). I stated that I felt this was incredibly hypocritical, but it didn't matter; I was sent to anti-racism anti-oppression training, one-on-one with a trainer chosen by my manager. I showed him the list, told him my side, and he said, in his professional opinion of doing this for 20+ years, that he felt I'm being singled out and I'm being sent to this training to be ""fixed"" so I'll go back to work, shut my mouth and be quiet. He believed this was a team issue being turned into a me issue, and I agreed. This was in September. In November we met with this trainer as a team. It was uncomfortable. I expressed my fear of sharing an opinion that someone disagrees with lest it be held against me at a later time. But we did the training, and things went back to normal. My working relationship with this young woman was never the same, but it was civil. 

Flash forward 3 months, when I am sitting in my office waiting for my first client of the day, and my manager and an hr rep entered my office and told me I am being let go because I ""don't fit in"" and that my ""views are better suited elsewhere."" It was out of nowhere. I had been so careful with everything I had said since August. I received no warning, no investigation, no opportunity to fight for my job. It was decided.

I have dedicated my life to helping others. I do not discriminate against anyone, quite the opposite in fact. I help individuals of all genders, sexual orientations, races, religions, ethnicities, ages and so on. I help many people who have been discriminated against, oppressed, or stigmatized. But I was on a team with a 23 year old female who only ever saw me as a white male, and she targeted me, and she was successful. She has had an impact on me financially, on my career, and a severe impact on my mental health. I hate her, and I hate my biased manager who handled the situation different than she would have if the roles were reversed. This is a scary time.

Edit: I should have mentioned I consulted an employment lawyer. He is a friend of a friend, so I trust him and his advice. He said that although I likely have a case of discrimination, he strongly suggested I don't take legal action on the basis of discrimination, due to the fact that I am straight, white and male. He said that win or lose the case, it would reflect bad on me, particularly in the field that I work in.

The list:
-age (she was the youngest on the team by 10 years. Myself, and the rest of the team, would occasionally playfully tease her about her age. I never once put her down because of it. At a team meeting she asked all of us to stop it, and I know I did. And yet, it still made the list) -he said that questions about power and privilege on interviews are useless (in fact, I said ""I didn't see the point"" but I was referring to one specific case, but that's a whole other story. But she generalized it, and that was not my intention or meaning nor my words) - mat leave (the women on the team were having a conversation about how the US was cutting parental leave time and were talking about how sexist it is. I said I don't think it's fair to call it sexist because, although it disproportionately affects women, it affects all genders who would take parental leave) -said he wanted another male on the team; ""there are too many of you and only one of me"" (at a team meeting we were talking about hiring a new person for the team, I suggested we consider hiring another male as some clients request male counsellors specifically and because I felt it might add some more diversity to the team. I was often shut down very quickly if the women on the team did not agree with my opinion. I certainly did not say the words she put in quotation marks) -you look nice (said to her ONE TIME in the year I worked with her before she gave this list, because she got dressed up for a presentation and I was just trying to be nice. I didn't think anything of it. I certainly wasn't hitting on her or flirting with her, and again, it was a one time occurence)
-he is aggressive when his point is not agreed with and does not take into account other people's feelings (in fact, I would often be shown aggression from the females on my team.

######Credit: u/FelineQuinine

Notice how 93% of workplace fatalities are still men.  A fact that men apparently do not get compensated for.

~~The math is pretty simple, though not obvious at first:~~

~~$1 / ($1 + $0.77) = 0.56~~

I think this shows pretty clearly what the largest factor in the earnings gap is.

Of course the fact that men have to work longer hours than women is itself a problem. Paying for dates and bills for your girlfriend / wife isn't exactly cheap. Not to mention that many women look for men who earn more money, thus creating an incentive for men to sacrifice their work-life balance in order to earn more.

I guarantee most men would love to work fewer hours and spend more time at home but the spending and earning patterns of their partners don't often facilitate this.

This also contributes to poorer health outcomes for men and the fact that men die 5 years earlier than women on average.

**Edit:** Graph is fine, title is misleading.  The 77 cents per dollar thing is likely just a colloquialism at this point.

I’m not joining the club. 

I can’t take you seriously if the word entitlement isn’t paired with responsibility. Start explaining what you are responsible for. 

I don’t care if you wear a bra. Why is this still a thing ? Do what you want. 

I don’t need to hear anything related to your reproductive cycle, we are not a couple so why do you feel like sharing publicly. Sharing is not caring. Your body is your business. 

If you take the time to creat list and be thoughtful do it silently. Telling others about the emotional labor you endured takes away from any generosity you supposedly offered. 

If women are still too sexualized it’s because too many of your sisters are looking for  a short cut. Deal with them, not me. 

If a man shares a thoughts or a feeling let him finish it. Talking isn’t a competitive sport. Emotions are real and not icons in your chat app. Let a man express himself  once in a while. And listen once in a while. 

And lastly, if men are so bad why do you glom onto them as if they are owed to you. No man owes you anything, least of all a relationship if he isn’t ready for one. Or if you are not the one.

It was one of those ""we're one big family"" tech companies who prided itself on having beer in the fridge and a ""great culture"". 

The management structure above me was my lead (female), mid level manager (female), direct manager (female), and department head (male). The HR department was 3 people (all female). For what it's worth, I am also an ethnic minority and all the women in management were white women. 

Myself, a female colleague, and another male colleague were all up for a promotion. The only one that walked away with a promotion was my female colleague, despite myself and my male colleague being there far longer (I actually interviewed and made the call to hire the person who was promoted). The company had a formal list of criteria needed for a promotion, so I created a list with evidence for every bullet point and sent it to my manager. She refused to even glance at it and told me my accomplishments were not relevant. Weeks later I pleaded with her to go over this document and discuss my career goals. She flipped out on me, called me all kinds of names, and then stormed off. 

I went to the head of the department and explained what had happened. He was shocked at the behavior and had no idea what was going on in the department. He scheduled a meeting with the three of us and she tried to lay into me again, but instead her boss chewed her out for unprofessional behavior. He then saw my list of accomplishments and decided I was definitely in line for a promotion and I was promoted not long after, along with my male colleague. I thought it was over. Boy was I wrong.

A few months later the department head left the company and was replaced by a female department head (so the entire management structure was female). My boss held a grudge and it was open season on me now. But this time she stepped over the line and harassed me over email with direct language about a disability I have. This is blatantly illegal so I went to HR. 

They immediately defended her and tried to gaslight me. Everything I said they tried to counter, until I presented them with the harassment in writing. I stood firm and knew my rights and they backed down. What transpired after that was 6 months of retaliation (I spoke to a lawyer and he said there's not much you can do until they fire you). 

Constant belittling, talking bad about me to other coworkers, turning people against me. Every 1 on 1 meeting we had was recorded (something she never did to anyone else). Every time I pushed this up the all female chain of command it fell on deaf ears. Eventually I left the company, just like they wanted. My position was filled by my boss's female friend. I am told by someone that still works there she had been badmouthing me behind my back for over 2 years.

Keep in mind this is a company where other female employees openly said they discriminated against men. They host and sponsor feminist events. They openly say their pride themselves on hiring women. 

When I reported my manager for harassment, it was me against a clique that openly made it clear where they stand, and that stance was firmly against men.

I know my experience is nothing compared to the literal horror stories that have been posted here but I just felt I needed to get this whole thing off my chest.

So I started thinking about opening an anti-feminism online store some time ago. I hate all these feminist slogan T-shirts that are everywhere nowadays. I wasn't familiar with the screen printing process but I figured I'd use the service of companies which handle that for you. And so I went for it. Boy, I was in for a treat.

After I'd created the shirt designs, I started looking for a screen printing company. I didn't expect there to be so many options to choose from, so I spent some time researching. There were two or three companies that kind of dominated the industry but they charged more than the rest just because they had more bells and whistles. 

This put me off as I couldn't afford to pay for unnecessary stuff. My first choice was a smaller company that I hoped would offer more of a personalized service. So I created my account, uploaded my designs and continued the work on my online store. However, the next day I was notified my designs were apparently in violation of this site's rules and qualified as offensive. I re-read their policy and while I did not agree that my designs [(here's a few examples)](http://imgur.com/a/mRjzb#1) were in any way abusive or offensive, I decided to let it go and use another service. I figured any arguments at that point would be meaningless.

Now here's where the real fun starts. After going through the entire process again - filling out forms, uploading designs etc. - I received a termination email of sorts from the second company too! This time it wasn't even some pre-written template. It was sent to me directly by the owner of the service, basically telling me to go to hell because of my 'ridiculous' views.

[Screenshot.](http://imgur.com/a/mRjzb#0)

A proud 'fefminist'? She must've been so mad that she started mistyping words and stuff, lmao. Acting all outraged by the fact that people are selling men's rights apparel. Because that's reserved for poor oppressed feminists only, right? But who's the oppressed one really? Again, my designs were in no way abusive!

Her condescending tone admittedly pissed me off, though the fact that she came off as an illiterate moron kind of amused me at the same time. It was frustrating mostly because I had to start all over several times but I tried not to get worked up about it and now I'm close to finishing my project with another company.

Everything I thought about feminism was true. It isn't about gender equality at all.

For the record, I have not mentioned any company names because I realize how passionate this community is. I don't want to feel guilty in case any companies/websites receive some sort of backlash due to my comments. Sure, I think they might deserve it to a certain extent but I also don't wish to affect their source of income even if their handling of the situation was questionable.

EDIT: To the guys who think I should post the companies' names: I appreciate your opinion, but it's not happening for the following reasons:

1) I DID submit personal details to both services. Some people have already called me a coward but I've had personal dealings with raving feminists before and I do not wish to go through all the bullshit again. Especially online. I don't have the time and I don't need the drama. If you feel I'm letting you down, sorry.

2) Whatever I've shared here, they will simply deny, so what's the point? It's their word against mine, except that it's also their company.

3) The companies are small enough that I can almost guarantee you won't be unfortunate enough to stumble upon their services unless you were very, very specific. If you're looking to get an online tee business going, don't make the mistakes I made and just go to a major company.

As far as the shirts go: as I mentioned in the original post, I'd considered working with one of the big screen printing companies to finish my store but after reading through the comments and doing some additional research, I'm going with an on demand fulfillment service. It's more convenient and I hope it won't take too long because I'm going on vacation soon. But more importantly, the process is completely automated so I won't have to deal with any more morons online. It costs more but I probably won't make much money either way, so fuck it.

Women complains that man keeping it professional at work makes her and other female coworkers feel uncomfortable","The other day I was bored and started doomscrolling on Reddit when I found this post on r/relationship_advice 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/10yx39j/a\_colleague\_at\_work\_27m\_of\_1\_year\_refuses\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10yx39j/a_colleague_at_work_27m_of_1_year_refuses_to/)

Essentially the post is about how some dude in the office (27M) won’t speak to OP (24F) and the other women at the office. He won’t talk with them about anything other than work with the girls, but is friends with the guys. However, he is cordial and will exchange some basic pleasantries (have a good day etc). In other words, he is being a normal coworker and OP doesn’t like that.

Now here’s the twist. OP said that one of the girls is considering go to HR about this because she is saying its creating a hostile work environment. This is the part that really pissed me off. Now I acknowledge that maybe the majority of women aren't like this, don't generalize blah blah blah I get it. However, it's not that every woman will, but that any woman can. This is the exact same situation as the google manager in a thread that got posted a while back where the guy got fired for not responding to a female coworker's advances. So the idea that this is an impossible scenario is simply false.

There is simply no winning anymore. Now if you follow the Pence rule, you can be punished for that to.   Act friendly with a woman and ask her out or show interest, and you get punished or fired for harassment. Okay. Men adapt. Now, you act professional with a woman, and her and her friends get upset that this is a hostile work environment and want to report this to HR. If a man does A he gets in trouble. If he does B he gets in trouble. If he reverses course and does Z or Y he gets in trouble as well. If he says f the system it's all BS and goes MGTOW, then he gets labelled incel, misogynist, sexist.

It is promising however that pretty much everyone in the thread called OP out for her total BS, but the simple fact that a group of women would even think to do this is just insane. I suspect (this is just my opinion) that the man is attractive, she showed interest, he says no thanks let's talk about work, and she takes it personally and builds a *hostile work environment* in her mind because she can't fathom that someone doesn't want to be best buddies with her *at work* and just wants to be professional. More attention-seeking bullshit. Nobody is entitled to friendship to anyone, but somehow this is too much to comprehend for some people. Imagine being so fragile that someone not being your best friend makes you feel uncomfortable. It honestly seems to me that she and the other girls at the office are harassing him. Rules for thee but not for me. I shoot you for no reason, but I am the victim.

Imagine if a group of guys went to HR and said, ""we feel upset that a female coworker at the office won't talk with us"". They would be annihilated. This is just complete delusion.

If everyone is to be paid the same, tests should be gender neutral. This would also account for genders other than male or female that people would like to be identified.

Physical fitness test should be cater to the job, not the gender. Military is a profession, not a welfare program.

This webpage, although a little outdated, gives a brief outline of the scoring standards for fitness tests of all US military services. ([https://mybaseguide.com/military-fitness-tests/](https://mybaseguide.com/military-fitness-tests/))

The one for the Army is a little outdated. The former test, APFT, was gender discriminatory. The new test, ACFT was initially supposed to be gender neutral. Then they changed it to where the scoring would be gender neutral, but females would get more promotion points for the same score. Then they changed one component of the test, from the leg tuck to the plank, and also made the scoring gender discriminatory. The most recent scoring for the test is ([https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/acft/ACFT\_scoring\_scales\_220323.pdf](https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/acft/ACFT_scoring_scales_220323.pdf)) .

I also hold the view that physical tests should also be AGE neutral. In the case of jobs or ranks that don't require high physical standards, make the physical tests less demanding ( a General doesn't need the same physical fitness as an infantryman/infantrywoman/infantryperson ).

FYI, the intelligence test for the US military is called the ASVAB, and is gender neutral.

For the argument that females bring skills other than physical fitness, if any such skill is important, it should be measured in a gender neutral way.

In case they need females for a specific task, a temporary limited exemption may be made (example: Cultural Support Teams that were useful in Muslim countries).  But a service wide exemption is unfair.

For the argument that females are generally less stronger that males and that should be accounted for: There is no reason to give special exceptions to any category. Why don't we categorize by height then? Why not by eye color, or hair color? What about gender makes it necessary to categorize by that? Also, combat is gender neutral.",jacare_o,t2_14fj8j,0.85,1961,307

I've discussed this idea with them, and none of them are advocates of women's rights like you read on the internet, or hear about radical feminists.

The feminists live in a world where they create this pseudo-oppression for themselves, and blame it on men.  Subsequently they feel the need to try and take rights away from men.  Equality for women is already here.  Feminists don't want equality, they want power.

&#x200B;

This LinkedIn study from 2019 used their internal data to examine differences between men and women when job searching. Among the key findings are the fact that men and women view a similar number of jobs though women apply to 20% fewer. A recruiter is 13% more likely to view a man's profile which she described as result of a problematic bias that must be corrected (even though they also found that recruiters will still contact both genders at equal rates).

However, the author (Maria Ignatova) makes no effort to hide her own bias (and sexism) by writing:

>The good news is that when women do apply to a job, they are 16% more likely than men to get hired. In fact, if the role is more senior than their current position, that number goes up to 18%.  
>  
>While this is an uplifting stat, it does show that women do a very thorough job at vetting roles — sometimes maybe too thorough. If women only apply when they feel extremely qualified, this could also indicate they are not pursuing stretch opportunities.

Linkedin is a mainstream website, not a fringe feminist blog. Yet blatant discrimination in hiring practices is celebrated as ""good news"" and as ""uplifting stat(s)"". This doesn't lead to equality, it's just another piece of evidence that equality isn't the actual goal.

Her analysis is also very weak and uses the usual strategy of reframing all issues so that women are the real victims. I think a more plausible hypothesis for why men apply to 20% more jobs is because if we are getting rejected more often then we need to submit more applications to increase our chances of finding work. Of course I would submit fewer if I was getting offers at 16-18% higher rate.

For most of us, this is just seeing statistics that support what we already knew is happening. The worst part is just being gaslit, and told this is ""equality"" and if we have a problem with it we are misogynist or examples of ""toxic masculinity"".

I live on the property of a private boat club, the property is gated, fenced, and has no trespassing signs all over. I live here to keep non-members out of the property as we are located on the water in a large park. 

Tonight I come home from work and do my walk around the property, as I do everyday, and I came across to young women sunbathing on one of the docks. I asked if they were members, they said no, and asked the to politely leave because this is private property. That's when they started to call me a perv, they can do what thay want, on and on. I am a very level headed person and let them rant and I calmly assed them to leave. They called 911 and screaming that some creepy old perv was harassing them. 

After a few minutes the police show up. Two female police. One goes and talks to the girls, the other talks to me. I explain to here that I live here and it is my job as caretaker to keep people from trespassing on the property. All the while the girls are getting all emotional with the other officer using words like creepy, they felt threatened, rape, the whole 9 yards. The 2 officers talk alone, then come over and cuff me risk me, take my wallet, phone, and keys, then seat me in the back of my car while they check my background and a warren search. All the while the two sunbathing girls are all giddy about me being in cuffs and taking my pic and text/posting like crazy. 

After about 15 minutes they take me out of the car and cuffs, and tell me I am free to go. (Go where? I fucking live here!) They then ask the girls, who are pissed that I was uncuffed, if they wanted to file a report against me, but they would have to leave the property. 

So for doing my job, on private property where I live, I end up in handcuffs for being considered ""creepy"" by doing my job. 

The officers never asked me if I wanted to file charges against them for trespassing.....of course. 

Update #1: I woke up this morning and my just venting on here blew up. I've replied to a few comments. I spoke to the board members of the club and we agree that in the future I should just call the non emergency number for the police and to record it. I also contacted a member who is a retired from the state supreme court and she told me ""that is utter bullshit"" as to how I was detained and she is putting a call into the police chief. I appreciate all the support, thank you!

Update #2: I recieved a phone call from the police departments internal affairs division today, they took a statement from me and are going to look into how the officers handled the call. I should hear something in a few weeks. I got the names of of the two girls who were tresspassing. So far I have not found any pics of me cuffed in the back of the car. 
  

Update #3, It has been over a month since I filed my complaint over be handcuffed, detained, questioned, and background checked. So this afternoon was low at work and I called the CPD internal affairs division to find out the status of my complaint against the officers. Well over 45 minutes being put on, on and off hold, I was told that there is no record of the report. I have the report number and they can't seem to find it.

Hello R\*\*\*,

I am not happy in your classes. I feel that it is the duty of the instructor to present the material as unbiased as possible, and as a proud feminist you do not do that. These issues are not new, I have been feeling this way for a long time. However, it was on Wednesday of last week that I reached my breaking point. In my twenties I may have identified as a feminist, but I’ve grown since. I do not support the feminist ideology. I believe in equal rights, but “woke feminism” is a joke at best, and very dangerous at its worst. I realize that you are very passionate about your feminist beliefs, but I am not, and I do not want to hear it in the classroom any longer. I have requested several times to transfer to another class however B\*\*\*\*\*n is not responding to my emails. I can no longer sit quietly on this. Until they can find another class for me to join, I will be joining your lectures, but I will do minimal participation. I will not answer questions, and my camera will be off. Topics such as mansplaining, manspreading and the pay gap are non-issues. Mansplaining is a feminist tactic to silence men, manspreading is due to biology, the pay gap is due to the difference choices that men and women make. To pay someone differently for the same job with the same qualifications is illegal and every time they look for it in the West, they repeatedly find men as the underpaid gender, if it exists at all. Just look at what happened with women’s soccer in the US and the BBC in the UK. There is no Patriarchy, just a hierarchy based upon competence, with the most competent rising to the top. And that is just the tip of the iceberg.

Feminism is an ideology based upon victimhood and I will not be a part of that belief system.

It is because I like and respect you that I am writing this email. If it was not for that, I would not have returned.

One last point, men make up 95% of war casualties. The ones that do survive are traumatized, disfigured and never the same. To say that women and children are the biggest victims of war, was deeply offensive. If one considers all people as equals and you can still regard women and children as the biggest victims of war, something is very wrong with your reasoning. Most of those men that died; died protecting our borders so we can be safe and enjoy our lives in peace. Do not discredit their sacrifices. None of them wanted to die, but that was the cost of our freedom.

Sincerely,

My professor's reply was sent through Bongo. Our classes are all online. I didn't realize that Bongo does not automatically save private messages.

I actually have a good relationship with the professor. I do have the support of all the students in the classroom. The day of the incident where she was particularly man bashing I commented that there was ""too much man hating going on"". The rest of the class either apologized or came to my defense. I really like my classmates. I then went completely silent for the rest of the week and did not join her class.

456,tcyo1p,2022-03-13,MensRights,"Australian report by feminist organisation claims support for men's rights is a ""significant barrier to gender equality""","This report summarises a survey of Australians with regards to attitudes towards gender equality and was conducted by a feminist organisation which is, as they all are, solely focused on things like getting more female CEOs and more women elected to political office.

There is some good news in the report and the feminists must have burned in anger at having to write it. For example:

>**Men have been forgotten in the struggle for gender equality**  
>  
>Our survey reveals a worrying statistic in this regard: nearly half of all male respondents “agreed or strongly agreed” with the statement that “gender equality strategies in the workplace do not take men into account”. If we disaggregate the data by generation, we find that while millennial and builder males were most likely to report feelings of being left out, all generations exhibited similar sentiments. Millennial males were also significantly more likely (48 per cent) to “agree/strongly agree” with the statement that “Men and boys are increasingly excluded from measures to improve gender equality”, followed by Gen Z males at 44 per cent. Gender equality measures are not the only interventions that are perceived by men to deepen, rather than fix existing inequalities. The highly contested concept of freedom of speech also reveals significant gendered differences, with men far more likely to say that political correctness benefits women in the workplace.

This section is surprisingly revealing of feminist motivations. I'm surprised they would include this in a public report:

>**Male moderates are champions of men’s rights**  
>  
>The moderate perspective combines an egalitarian set of views around gender equality in the workplace and at home with rising concern over what they understand as the growing impact of political correctness in Australian society, as well as a strong desire to see men’s rights equally represented in public discussion of equality issues. Given that 62 per cent of Australians align with the moderate position and its value system, this represents a significant barrier to gender equality.

Got that?

Feminists think that concerns for men's rights and a desire to see men treated equally to women are an obstacle to feminists achieving the goals that they dishonestly label ""equality"".

Other stats cited include:

* 41% of Australian men believe that political correctness gives women an advantage in the workplace
* 46% of Australian men believe that gender equality measures do not take men into account
* 42% of Australian men believe that men and boys are increasingly excluded from measures to improve gender equality

The feminist authors fear that these popular and growing attitudes could result in a ""backlash"" against feminist initiatives and ""backsliding"" away from the goals which they're pursuing.

Of course, any time that feminists are unhappy or even hysterical it is good news for men and for progress towards true equality. I see this report as quite positive.

This stopped me in my tracks. Working in a male-dominated industry, I've felt pressure to conform to certain beauty standards, often at the expense of my own physical well-being. The walkthrough took 3 hours, accompanied by two men. There were moments when I walked in front of them, particularly while climbing flights of stairs, and it's hard to believe this went unnoticed. Where's the humanity?

More than that, I've often been put in situations where I've been expected to endure whatever bullshit I'm facing, not just at work but in life as a whole.

I don’t know. There's a deeper commentary here beyond 'beauty standards are dumb'. Seeing my shoes in this condition made my heart hurt.",coldbrewcult,t2_pr51b7xm,0.9,2812,237

1.) Almost immediately after a car accident one morning, I had to Uber the rest of my way to work. I was already a little shaken up, but once we got to the office, the driver kept demanding my phone number and became increasingly hostile the more I would tell him “no”. 

2.) I took a commission-based sales job but only lasted one week. The reason? There were actually two. The first one being a guy getting in my face and attempting to grab the company tablet I had in my hands. He just laughed when he noticed I was scared. The other reason was because another guy had kept trying to touch me inappropriately. These two incidents were on the same day. I went back to the main office and resigned after the second one. Fun fact about this one, my significant other at the time actually got angry with me for quitting this job and we ended up getting into an argument. 

3.) A guy, presumably in his 50’s-60’s, accosted my friends and I in a mall parking lot, making explicit remarks towards us. We were only in middle school. 

I’m sure there are other stories I could share, or that have been completely removed from my memory.

A job is a job, and everyone deserves to be treated like a human, no matter what job they do. But the fact of the matter is, a lot of the stuff you see on porn sites is not a worker voluntarily entering into a labor contract and being fairly compensated for it. It's rape and sex trafficking. Frequently, it's rape of a minor, and the fact that the only two options in this debate are ""all porn is vile evil mysoginistic exploitation"" and ""all porn is good porn and if you criticize the industry then you don't see sex workers as humans"" really bothers me.

Married women everywhere dream of men who take charge and make them feel loved because in real life they spend all day caring for their husbands and families. It’s not a popular genre among women because it represents real life, it’s because its a complete inversion of the way most heterosexual romances work.

491,y6g1ab,2022-10-17,Feminism,The Amouranth situation should change people's mind about sex work,"Throwaway because I have coworkers on my other account and I don't want this controversial opinion known in my work place.

&#x200B;

Let me preface this post by saying this : I believe that sex work is work, I believe that sex work should be decriminalized  because that is the only way to provide a safe environment for the sex workers, an environment in which they feel safe to report assault. However, I believe that sex work, like any other type of work under capitalism, is exploitative. But, there is an added layer of misogyny thrown in the middle. Most sex workers are women, most sollicitors are men, most pimps are men, and I don't think you can analyze this phenomenon outside of the patriarchal lens. Therefore, I can not, in good faith, repeat the slogan ""sex work is empowering"", I believe the vast majority of sex workers are abused, and I abhore the liberal feminist way of glamorizing sex work, especially to impressionable young teens.

&#x200B;

If you don't know who Amouranth is, she is one of the top twitch streamers and if i'm not mistaken, one of the earliest to start the Hot Tub streams. She also has an OF and has been making over a million dollars a month on both of these platforms. She is what many would refer to as an independent sex worker, she's not working with a porno production company, she is her own boss and has people working FOR her. Yesterday, she went live on twitch and revealead live and with proof, that she has been abused by her husband of 7 years, that HE was the one to force her to become The Amouranth that we all know today. She was even forced to keep their marriage a secret because it would ""damage the brand"" according to him, it was kept so secretive that not even people who have met her and streamed with her multiple times knew about it. Basically, she had been trafficked this whole time, while being used as an example of someone who willingly performs sex work, being evidence that sex work can be empowering.

&#x200B;

This situation was the final nail in the coffin for me, I have kept the possibility that a few sex workers may be doing this with no brainwashing and no coercion, but after everything that came out, I can not, in good faith, entertain this possibility. Amouranth had a documentary done on her in which she stated she was happy with what she was doing out of her own volition, so I can not help but wonder how many other sex workers who do it out of their own volition are lying about it. 

&#x200B;

Now, this isn't to say that we shouldn't believe them, or stop them from doing it, I am not even blaiming Amouranth for lying about this, and I absolutely unequivocally stand with her, she is a victim of abuse and deserves all the support she can get. My argument is about the bigger picture, feminists can not continue to defend sex work as a respectable arena for women, it is abusive, dehumanizing, and dangerous. Here, we had the case of a woman who seemed to be doing it all on her own, coupled with the statements of several former sex workers, the glamorization of places such as OF needs to end. We need an honest discussion around the topic, I understand that many believe that if we state how exploitative sex work can be, we're going to be contributing to the stigma and therefore danger that sex workers face, but I believe there is a way to stand up for sex workers, without dragging more gullible young victims into this dangerous job.",Ok-Target-349,t2_tfyd4f1h,0.94,873,164

I didn’t wanna end up stuck working in an environment that would be hostile towards me. I’ve changed my major since then and would still like to code for fun and because it would be helpful for what I’m going into (statistics).

541,18wnt0m,2024-01-02,Feminism,"Not all men, but all women","(I don't know how well I'm going to get my point across but I'll try) Every feminist discussion regarding male violence against women and girls is flooded with variations of this sentiment. The main fear of the ""not all men"" demographic is that every man would be punished for the deeds of a few, right? Some of them even assert that they are already being punished. That they are afraid to talk to women or work with them. 

But women have always been punished for the violence that men enact against us. Collectively. Here are two events that have happened in the past month:

[A state in India proposed to ban late-evening coaching classes. The ban applied specifically to female students](https://scroll.in/latest/1059678/wrong-at-many-levels-social-media-users-decry-up-ban-on-late-evening-coaching-for-women) It was revoked after criticism, thankfully. 

[Taliban puts abused women in jail to ""protect"" them](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67724424)

These are particularly egregious examples but how removed is this mindset from the rest of the world? These legal measures are directed specifically at women when it was far more logical to apply them to men.

When ""metoo"" gained popularity:  
- 21% of men said they would be reluctant to hire women for a job that would require close interaction (such as business travel)  
and  
- 19% of men said they would be reluctant to hire an attractive woman.  
[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/29/men-women-workplace-study-harassment-harvard-metoo) (BTW: Taking this into account, doesn't ""we are afraid to talk to women or work with them"" come off as a threat?)

Once we realised that women face sexual harassment and abuse, the response was to punish *them*. To restrict their careers.

I know I'm not saying anything new. Imagine curfews aimed only at men (or stricter for men). Men being slut shamed for drinking, partying with the opposite gender or for the way they dress. Imagine a country where men are the ones who are not allowed to work outside the home or go out without a female chaperone. But it's the other way around. Rules are always made for women to ""protect"" them. Every woman's career, social life and freedom in general is compromised. 

**Women are collectively punished for the deeds of men.** No law specifically targets men, like in the two articles I've shared above. No institutes are openly threatening to not hire men in response to a social movement.

So do the notallmen men think this is fair? Are they speaking out against this? Notallwomen too, right?",identitty_theft,t2_5lzmdyue,0.96,732,100
546,14wgof8,2023-07-11,Feminism,Leg shaving is a huge societal brainwash,"I feel compelled to write about this and my experiances and opinions. I'd love to hear what you think and your own experiances. I live in the UK btw. 

I stopped shaving my legs at the beginning of 2020. I have PCOS and thick hair so I have more leg hair than some men (my partner is one of them). 

I hate how women are seen as gross and disgusting for having natural hair which is there for a purpose. Women are pressured to shave their legs to appease society even if they hate doing it. I feel this myself. I am still too embarrassed to show my hairy legs in my home town. I'm a very well known face in my town due to the job I do (I hate this and am working on moving town and changing job). I can't bring myself to not care and not care about the gossip. I fear comments and judgement.

It is not normal in today's society for a female to have armpit and leg hair. It boggles my mind. It's nature and men can have it! From some googling it seems like fashion magazines told us we had to and society blindly followed until it was normal and weird for women to have hair. This brainwash happened so fast and has stayed so long. 

Female shaving serves absolutely no practical purpose other than to appease society. I notice it's so much easier to stay warm with hair legs, naturally because that's why it's there. I am saving so much money and time. I couldn't go back to shaving now. 

On the topic of attracting partners. Well purely from my experiance many men pretend they care but they really do not. I was single for a few years waiting for someone special but I had lots of casual sex. I was rejected on dating apps for my hairy legs less than 50% of the time. It seemed they were just happy to get some pussy. Many men would stroke my hairy legs after we had sex. Probably because it was a new experiance. I haven't had many female lovers but they really didn't care including on dating apps. 

I was always upfront about wanting casual sex and having hairy legs. Maybe this would have been different if seeking a relationship. 

My current male partner is bi. He said he doesn't care. He said he'd be a hypocrite if he liked men with body hair but not women. We live our happy hairy lives together. I love his hairy chest and back. He helps trim my pubes when they're very long because I can't see what I'm doing. I personally feel more hygienic with trimmed pubes. Gosh I hate it shaved though.

567,17mm64i,2023-11-03,Feminism,"A former sex-workers perspective on dark femininity, marrying for money/finding a ""provider""/finessing""/bimbofeminism etc","I just want to preface this by saying  that I have done sex-work ""light"". I used to work as a stripper and phone sex operator so I am in no way saying this to shame sex workers or the women I am talking about.

But something that really concerns me is the rise of *movements* that involve helping women to get *money* out of men or *manipulating* men (as written in the title) and how it has become mainstream and popularized to the younger generation.

While I don't  think its a bad thing for women to channel and share their wisdom, I am afraid that many don't realize that this kind of advice like ""how to get a rich husband"" uses techniques from sex-work and implicitly mainly IS for women that in some shape or form work in the sex industry. Even though the content creators  don't say that out loud.. So its not a way of life and many teenage girls will never work in the industry or even come close to be in those environments.

But now that that ""transactional mindset"" has become popularized I fear that many teenage girls will actively seek out a ""benefactor/provider"" or a ""sugar daddy"" thinking they will make easy money. What they don't realize is that by doing that they will  attract rapists and other very harmful men.

The kind of men that are willing to pay girls for their time or give expensive gifts have ALL bought prostitutes (I can PROMISE you that, especially the rich ones) and for me prostitution IS rape because you can't buy consent. These men are also *comfortable* with objectifying women and *like* that dynamic they are *used* to that dynamic.

What many of these content creators don't tell you is also the extent of what they had to do to get that money (and I get it because it's shameful and taboo). But for me I could NEVER go into early retirement  because  the money I made as a stripper was simply not enough. The elefant in the room is that the BIG money comes from doing prostitution and fulfilling weird fantasies and fetishes . Nothing is for free and the rhetoric that ""you can get a birkin bag for just being cute on a coffee date"" is simply unrealistic.

I have talked to many strippers that just wanted to work for a year but got sucked into the industry and ended up working for ten years and now, that's the only thing they can do and they are miserable. Not to talk about the trauma of being a sex-worker and how it fucks with your mind and perception of yourself.

I am just afraid that we are grooming a whole generation of young women that don't ""need"" to go into sex-work for lifelong trauma and objectification of themselves. As a stripper I never believed the bullshit the men were telling me about ""providing me a better life"" I got in and out before the industry had a chance to crush me. I would even argue that the strip club is far safer than seeking out this privately or on your own. Some of the men I saw other strippers give lap dances to were generally frightening and I can't imagen what they would have done if they were alone with these girls.

She, in writing, advised they not hire this woman. She made up official reasons, but in person she said the above to me.

She didn't want to hire her based solely on the fact that she was a woman.... Not because there was a better male candidate, or any better candidate. She literally said she wanted them to hire a man, any man, instead of this woman because women are too much drama and men don't have feelings. 

Please can someone confirm I'm not crazy - this is, in fact, blatant discrimination in the hiring process and blatant sexism? Right?

Luckily upper management was impressed with this young woman who was discriminated against and she got the job, despite this other woman actively discouraging them from doing so. But no matter what, the fact that she discriminated against her and that she also was so brazen as to admit that behavior casually to me (also a woman!) is disgusting.

For my part,  I told her it was discrimination, it was wrong to do that, men DO have feelings (but often feel afraid to express them bc of people like her), and women are all different and multifaceted people and cannot be lumped into one category of being ""too much drama"" and that's a hurtful and false characterization of women. 

She acted like I was being over dramatic. And I am very passionate about equal rights for women so please tell me - what do you think? Is this workplace discrimination?

Women’s lack of education also weakens a society in times of an economic crisis or war.  So it seems irrational any way I look at it. What are the reasons?

642,1ajt193,2024-02-05,Feminism,Unpopular Opinion: Women (at least for a few years) NEED to be alone,"I was reading ""A room of one's own"" by Virginia Woolf where she basically argues that women need money and independence to write. It got me thinking about something that could be somewhat controversial which is that in order for a woman to meet her full potential she NEEDS TO BE ALONE. Like she needs to live alone. I'm not saying away from her parents, no man. I'm saying no roommates or anything. I feel like society grooms women to feel dependent on other people and counter intuitive.

When you're in a relationship you're going to be affected by that person. You literally can't help it, you are affected deeply by the people around you and your environment. I think women really need to figure shit out by themselves. We also unconsciously seek validation from those around us because again, in the passed we were told that our value and success is based on getting validation from those around us. And specifically in the workplace, while men are simply validated based on their work performance, women are forced to seek validation in their demeanor, the way they act, the way they talk, the way they dress, to be respected.

I know some of you might disagree but literally think about it for a second. At any time in your life when you were around other people do you not think that you could've thrived in a setting that was completely controlled and managed by yourself?

Also to add: This is coming from a woman with a middle eastern cultural background, and what fuels this argument for me is the fact that in the Middle East, its not culturally accepted for a woman to be alone. They live with their parents until marriage and then move in with their husbands. Subsequently, women in the Middle East are pushed into societal expectations of being a housewife. They are typically not pushed into career excellence but rather they are taught to be a good housewife and mother. I see a strong correlation with the lack of physical independence and the societal expectation for eastern women to be dependent on men for their entire lives.

Update: more thoughts- I think taking a year or two to live in your own space, be secure in yourself and figuring out exactly what you like and don't like without the influence of others and just learning to be completely fine by yourself it will completely change your outlook on life. **With all these romantic comedies and romance novels and the fucking love songs 24/7 getting popularized, women (as I've seen on social media) have started feeling incomplete without a relationship and it's pushed us into this feeling of loneliness and a never ending quest for love. But when you live alone until you find that perfect sense of contentment and stoicism, when you think it's time to go on and start looking for a relationship, you will not lower or sacrifice a single fucking standard because you'll KNOW a relationship isn't the center of your life and men aren't the center of the world. You'll start seeing relationships and dating like men do, which are commodities. They're nice to have around, they make life easier, but they aren't a necessity by any means. That's how men see us. The only thing they feel like they need from women is sexual gratification. So they're in zero rush to find someone and they will fuck everyone and their mom over without skipping the beat. And they're confused when we ""care too much"" about things that they don't think matter.  When in truth, society has pushed this narrative on us so severely that our lives are empty and bland if we're single and not exploring anything.**

*Update: I'm going to address the financial side of this since a lot of people were concerned. Of course I know that it's a financial strain to have to live alone and it's just not possible for many people. My argument is that* ***If*** *you have the option between living with others or comfortably living alone, to choose the latter. And people have commented saying that while working 3 jobs they were happier and more comfortable living alone than when they moved in with other people. I agree. Before starting a family I would work 4 jobs if it meant financial independence and the chance to see that I'm an individual as opposed to someone's daughter or someone's future wife and mom. It is so so so important to get to know yourself in that way. Also I feel like the counter arguments don't understand that you're trading some comforts, financial wiggle room to buy more shit, travel, etc. for your own comfort at home. If you financially rely on other people there is this weird imbalance where you feel the need to compensate emotionally and it's just exhausting. Fuck that. Take at least a few years, in your 20s before you get married where you're not in a relationship and you live life on your own terms. If you're living on your own terms you don't need to spend time and energy pleasing others, which is what we're taught is all we have. Instead we can redirect that time and energy into self improvement- thriving-meeting our full potential.*
