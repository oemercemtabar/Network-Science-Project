0,1anslbc,2024-02-10,MensRights,"In the workplace, incompetent women fail upwards while competent men are kept down","I’m in my late 20s and have worked for a Fortune 500 company ever since I graduated college with an engineering degree. I’ve worked with thousands of people, and have kept tabs on some people’s job titles over the years while remembering the type of worker and person they were when I needed to deal with them. 

I’ve worked with dozens of men that I have gotten to know well enough to understand how competent they are at their jobs, and how they are consistently expected to do the same work as women 2-3 pay grades above them. I’ve seen women slack off, but because they are friends with their female manager, they get every promotion and spot bonus. The men never get promoted and are expected to do the lion’s share of the work and/or the work with the highest stakes. 

I’ve taken it upon myself to go into young men’s career pages in my company where you can leave unsolicited feedback, and write paragraphs about the projects and tasks these men have helped me with over the course of a year in an attempt to boost them up. However, this is usually to no avail. Meanwhile I see women in my office (typically managers and directors) cackling with each other about personal bullshit for hours while the men sit at their desks to grind out the real work. The women don’t really do anything, but somehow get themselves into these cushy positions with high pay. 

I’ve tried to move further up the ladder myself and have done okay. But now I’m in a position where I have women in my department making 40k more than me while doing less work, but my manager is personal friends with a lot of them which apparently makes that ok. I recently shared data that showed how much more work I did (and higher stakes work) than my average coworker (about 25% more), and I got a 3% raise. At this point my plan is to take a giant step back in the amount of work I’m doing while keeping the same pay, save, invest, and retire by 40 with ~1.5 mil.

It’s become such a fucking joke. Unfortunately I don’t see how corporate settings will ever get better for men, unless we all withdraw from the work force and leave all the real work for women. 

TLDR; women receive favoritism in the workplace over men. It’s probably never going to get better. Don’t work too hard.",Thin_Relation3562,t2_tumpfzga2,0.94,205,42
1,160qu14,2023-08-25,MensRights,Feeling the burnout of feminism in the workplace,"So I wanna get this out of the way first, I can appreciate that woman still support feminism for various reasons, but I also don't think it's sexist or wrong to point out the fact that a noticeable amount of feminism is blatant misandry these days.

So I work for a relatively large corporate company, and lately I've been finding it rather tedious to sit through certain meetings or presentations regarding woman in the workplace, because they can blatantly talk negatively about men and disregard them entirely and it's deemed OK.

So we had this lady do a presentation on empowering woman to come into our industry as a career, the usual ""why aren't woman represented more in this field"". The correct answer is that men and women simply have different interests and this just isn't as interesting to woman as it is to men, but no, that's sexist think today. So anyway the presentation was happening, and this particular lady started talking about male privilege, white male privilege, all the privilege. 

A male co worker had politely pointed out that woman also have a level of privilege regarding the workplace, this lady was actually a gender quota hire, hired simply for being female. He pointed that out. She asked for him to be removed from the presentation for being disrespectful and hostile...

So one of the reasons this type of stuff annoys me is because male privilege isn't real. I've never felt like I've had any sort of benefit for being a man, especially when it comes to employment. I finished school and struggled to find work, every employer wanted the 18 year old with 20 years experience, I worked any odd job I could get for years, travelled around the country from town to town, living with relatives or living in hostels just to take these jobs. I flipped burgers at fast food places, worked telemarketing, hard labour jobs, you name it. I dealt with endless time wasting from potential employers, I'd travel a long distance for an interview only to be told then and there by a receptionist that the interview was cancelled, no notice and a generic fake apology.

I've dealt with mental health issues and being suicidal because the struggle to find permanent work was that hard and I was always broke. Finally, I got lucky and landed a job that provided on the job training. Now I work in this industry and while I still have your usual problems here and there that I'm sure everyone does, I'm always grateful that I finally have stable employment even if it's not always fun. Alot of men I know have gone through similar things, especially if they've had an injury at work and have had to try and get back into the workforce after that.

So this lady holding a presentation on how men just have life on easy mode and how they have all these advantages simply for being men, it's just exhausting to listen to. But if you don't attend you're seen as a negative person for the company, if you dare question these feminist woman and challenge their own privilege, like my male co worker did, you're removed from the presentation, and I wouldn't be surprised if HR gave him a stern warning about ""misogyny"" too. The most frustrating part is, imagine if I, a man, held a presentation on men in the workplace and how we don't get the same benefits woman do like being hired simply for being men, or being prioritised in the hiring process because the company wants to have more woman in the company, being hired even if you aren't the most qualified simply because you're a man. 

I've had to fight tooth and nail for everything in my career, so it annoys me because it really comes off as all of my hardships and struggles not being a big deal. But if I said the same thing about this lady, I'd most certainly be fired. But yet, nobody says anything. She even bought up the gender pay gap and used all the same lies and misrepresented info that feminists love using to talk about it. Everyone knew she was completely wrong, but nobody can say anything.

I'm just really fed up with having to go to work and listen to these ridiculous people complain about how everything they have isn't enough and that all the men in that room, men who have gone through alot to get into these jobs and climb the ladder to the positions they're in, are somehow privileged and haven't had to fight for those things. When these same feminist woman (I call them that because normal woman think these ladies are full of shit too), they refuse to acknowledge that they haven't had to work very hard at all to get into those positions and get very defensive if someone mentions things like quota hires. 

Has anyone else dealt with this at their job? We even had a lady who came on to talk about the struggles of being a woman in the workplace, and yet when she talked about her career it was all positives, she was just complaining about how she hasn't seen as much career growth as her male co workers, but even acknowledged that she took alot of time off to start a family and went back to work while her husband stayed home and how she struggled with the pressure of working full time and then coming home to be a parent too, like yea, men have been doing that for decades. That's how it is when you have children as a man, you still gotta go to work. Only these days you see the reverse, but these ladies complain about that now too. 

I'm booking a week off work because I'm just so sick of hearing about it, these ladies who send 3 emails and then need a coffee break, or forever leave work early because their children are sick or something and then they hold these types of presentations to complain about how they don't make as much money, it's because they're at work less often, even the other woman in our office have tried telling them this, but these feminist type woman just don't want to listen. It's like you've insulted them to say yea, you didn't get paid as much this month because you left work early 5 or 6 times and didn't work it back. I'm so glad there's ladies in my office who call this bullshit out too, feminism is exhausting and shouldn't be allowed at work what so ever imo. It's hypocritical that they can have these presentations and disregard all the men, but if a man were to do the reverse, there'd be hell to pay.",AdAny7443,t2_av01gb70s,0.9,41,28
2,177hc7o,2023-10-14,MensRights,White men are actively discriminated against in the job market right now,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm a 32 year old white male in the tech industry. Specifically PM work. I was let go in the mass layoffs months ago by a major tech company that all of you probably know of. I have been in multiple interview rounds with good companies and I have never seen the market this bad for white men ever in my adult career.

Just to preface without sounding like gloating, I have a good resume with solid experience from desirable companies. I've had a number of interviews, and for the positions I want, most hiring managers/majority of panel interviewers have been women, either white or minorities. And oddly enough, every single time I reach the final stages of the interview process and I find myself interviewing with one of these women in a position of power, I get a swift rejection email.

I am cordial, well spoken and friendly. I received two offers from interviews, with the hiring managers/majority of panel members being men but unfortunately they are not companies I am very interested in.

**Two alarming trends I have noticed in tech are that being a white man is an instant negative for most companies**, especially if you find yourself in front of a panel of women or a hiring manager who is a woman. Women are also being promoted to these HM positions in much less time than their male counterparts.

**The other is underqualified women are getting these jobs that white men are competing for at increasing rates.** I checked back for the roles I was rejected for that have been filled and, unsurprisingly, all but one of them were filled by women with less experience than I have.

Just wanted to let other men (white men specifically) that are struggling know that you aren't alone. You don't meet the quotas that these companies have and you are playing against a stacked deck. This is the worst I have ever seen it, and I can only assume it will get worse. I have spoken with close friends and they are experiencing the same thing.

&#x200B;

Millions and millions of sobbing Tiktoks of women working tech and office jobs, complaining about how the work standards are hard to come by\[even though women on average have less of a barrier of entry in the workplace since their degree of competition  in terms of competency, merit and skill isn't as called for as that of men\], yet majority of men work literally thankless jobs out there keeping it to themselves

And look they're entitled to their emotional agency about things, that's fine

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My question is, why are they fine using emotional manipulation to ask others to feel pity for them, when the majority of society doesn't even respect men's laboral forthcomings?

&#x200B;

Can you imagine the sheer amount of disrespect and ridicule a man would get if publicly and openly cried or displayed discomfort in his workplace or jobsite?

&#x200B;

And to be honest this is because for awhile men could not afford the luxury of downness letting them get them because somebody had to build up the infrastructure of society

&#x200B;

Obviously tryna avoid generalizations, but it is funny to see so many corporate-driven boss babe types join in the men shaming other men their work ethics, while the majority of women as a whole barely even work anything infrastructure-related

Just blows my mind

**But btw, I do have mad respect for women who try to work through it all, those women legit garner my respect automatically**

5,1ad9hyw,2024-01-28,MensRights,Are women taking over all the jobs?,"There’s a lot of talk about immigrants taking over jobs in the West. That’s bullshit! The majority of the jobs immigrants do are low-paying and unskilled, which Westerners aren’t willing to do. The real question is whether women are taking over almost all industries in the West. Every job I go to, every shop I buy something at, every doctor I visit, every plane I board, there are more women than men. I barely see men, other than maybe construction or some hard labor. So is there an agenda to hire more women than men? What’s going on? This is not a misogynistic question. This is a genuine question.

 

Edit: I’m from Somalia, which is in East Africa, but I’m currently in the USA. The majority of foreign countries, especially in Asia and Africa, Women stay home to take care of the kids. The few women who do go to work do it temporarily, and most of them prefer to stay at home. It seems like in the West, there’s a huge push by governments and international institutions to get every woman to work. I’ve also noticed that the easier the job, the more women there tend to be.

Final Edit: I've noticed that while working retail and various low-paying jobs throughout the years, the majority of managers, whether men or women, choose to give the hard tasks to men or boys.

7,6uumes,2017-08-20,MensRights,Fuck office politics: newly arrived female coworker is in difficulty with her work and is attacking my reputation behind my back. WTF???,"The reason I post here is because many of the things this coworker does she can get away with it because she's a woman, and she's blatantly using female shaming tactics (people may not agree with the fact these are female tactics, but I think they are), *in the workplace*, to get her way...

She had a task: do her job and learn ho to do new things. Me (and others) supported her. After a few months I no longer had the obligation to support her and I realized she was slacking on purpose (facebook, amazon, chats, etc, instead of working). She... didn't like that. Because she had decided *not* to learn anything, when push came to shove and she needed to deliver, she went mad and started using the only coin at her disposal to fight the situation: social group, gossip, men-hating.

She started attacking me behind my back, trying to ruin my reputation. Her reasoning was that our boss was pressuring her to deliver, she didn't know how to do the job (spent months without applying herself) and because I was capable of doing it, *I had to drop everything for her*.

To quote her (a coworker showed me this):

- ""why doesn't Demian do it instead of me? He's the only one who knows how to do it anyway..."".
- ""I'm stuck with this, the *client* is an asshole, it's not clear what I have to do... of course it would be a lot easier if Demian supported me, but he never helps me...""
- ""this job is shit, can't do it... talk to me about your weekend :)""
- ""I asked X to give me a hand, I'm waiting for him. I watched this cool movie last night...""

Again and again, complaints in private to her friend (one of the PMs) in order to get someone to tell me to do the job *for her*. Never mentioning how she was told, when hired, that *she needed to learn this stuff*! Only implying how she's willing to do the job but my lack of support is blocking her (false and shameless accusation)...

She decided by herself that team work meant she was excempted from every responsibility. This is an example of a chat conversation:

- SHE: demian, you are not busy, right? :)
- ME: I'm busy, sorry.
- SHE: eh... you are doing research... can't you help me with this?
- ME: sorry, but I can't help you. Try to take it slowly and face one problem at a time, you'll get there.
- SHE: but I need someone to show me how it's done...
- ME: and I sent you lots of material months ago, I can't do the job for you..

She grabbed the last message and send it to four different women and a guy so they could support her in bashing me.

I had to protect myself after that. I intervened with certain coworkers and made sure my version was known. After a few days, she made so much noise and her work was so behind that my boss asked me my opinion on her and her work. 

Because of what she did (the chat convo was just one occurrence of her gossip), I sunk her in front of my boss. I spent almost 8 months without saying anything negative about a coworker (her!) in order to avoid putting her in a difficult spot, and what does she does?

She targets me because I don't go over mountains for her (where does the entitlement come from lol????) and decides to fuck with my reputation, just because she was lazy and had to choose between admitting her lack of knowledge to my bosses (damage to her image) or use social games to blame *me* instead (damage to *my* image)...

-------

Right now, I was promoted and next month I'll be in charge of her work. At the moment, she latched onto another coworker, constantly ""asking"" him how to do things, constantly ""asking"" him to look up stuff for her by saying ""she doesn't know how to do the job..."", and implying he has to because of ""team work""...

While the guy looks for stuff up, she opens her chat or facebook and starts doing random stuff or talking with her friends, waiting for him. And the spineless guy refuses to say ""no"" to her, is depressed and overloaded of work all day, and earns even less than she does...

And by the way, whenever the guy can't cope with it anymore and snaps at her, she starts gossiping behind his back telling everyone how this guy is having his ""ladies days""...

The three of us were on the same role inside the company, but unlike us, who focused on the job, she focused on her relationship with the others. At first I thought this wouldn't be an issue because we are all different, until she started using that ""support group"" she formed to backup her up on her lack of skills and all her BS...

Fucking office politics. And fuck women who blatantly push to establish social bonds with other women and then use gossip to get their way against men who actually work and don't give a crap about this stuff...",demian78,t2_ax22xax,0.89,934,219

9,1akqzjk,2024-02-07,MensRights,Is being a male a disadvantage in the workplace for both hirings and promotions?,"I just wanted to gauge other people’s experience on whether they have noticed any potential gender disparities in regard to workplace opportunities (both hirings and promotions) throughout their careers.

In my 15 years of Biotech/Pharma industry experience, here are some of the trends that I have noticed.  

Note: these are just subtle observations that I (n=1) have noticed throughout my career and it may not reflect the norm.

— Hiring Process —
- If an equally qualified male and female apply to the same role, the female candidate is (significantly) more likely to be contacted for an interview.
- When applying to the same role, male candidates must be more qualified than their female counterparts, but they cannot be too qualified.  Otherwise, their application will be rejected.
- When interviewing, men are more likely to experience interviews (neutral) or interrogations (negative), whereas women experience more conversations (positive).
- When companies use a standardized interview process, women are more likely to experience positive non-verbal communication than men.
- When interviewing women, hiring managers are primarily looking for red flags for not hiring them, whereas for men, they’re initially discarded must prove why they should be hired.
- When companies hire women for leadership positions, they are more likely to celebrate and announce the hiring on social media.
- When companies celebrate hitting their diversity targets, it often primarily benefits women (who may actually be the majority in the company or department).
- Hiring managers are praised for hiring women onto their teams over men.
- HR interviewers are primarily women, which likely skews the candidates that move forward with the hiring manager in favor of women.

— Workplace Promotions —
- Women require less accomplishments than their male counterparts to become eligible for promotions.
- Line managers are more likely to assist women with their yearly goals in order to fast-track them for promotions (or give them easy ones).
- Men require more years of experience than women to be considered an SME (Subject Matter Expert) for a given discipline.

— Ramifications of the Above —
- When applying to jobs, women need to apply to less companies before getting hired, they’re more likely to get a highly desired job, and their new job is more likely to be a promotion instead of a lateral move.
- Since men are more likely to have to settle for lateral moves, they will experience more criticism from interviewers if their resume had indicated that they had any history of job hopping.
- Women are getting promoted into leadership positions at a much younger age than their equally or more-qualified male counterparts, allowing them to make hiring decisions early on and influence company culture sooner.
- Since women are getting fast-tracked into leadership, they are earning significantly more money than their male peers of the same age, earning them potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars more throughout the course of their careers.
- Due to the current system, men have jobs and women have careers.
- Since men are beginning to see that the workplace is significantly biased against them, they are engaging in quiet-quitting and only doing the bare minimum (even if that was not their original desired intent).
- Companies are creating exclusive intracompany groups (‘Women in Leadership’) for advancing the careers of women.  Even suggesting such a group for men is a laughable offense (or worse).
- Due to the favoritism toward women, men are more likely to experience poor end-of-year reviews, go on PIPs (performance improvement plans), get assigned grunt work, experience poor morale, get blacklisted, have their ideas get ignored by management, not get credit for their efforts, stagnate in their career, become demoralized by the work environment, etc.",ThrowAway373728491,t2_idc4pazot,0.9,54,15

11,1588ci8,2023-07-24,MensRights,Women have the burden of their appearance in the workplace myth,"**I grew up listening to this theory,** that women have to take care of their appearance all the time, which adds to the burden of their existence. It is only way more difficult, that they are forced to accept the constant flirting of men in the workplace, which is nothing less than harassment, as well as the ""social expectations"", that are being forced on them. 

**Sounds plausible.** Indeed, I need no make-up, my clothes are simpler to choose, my hair easier to take care of. I am not really being hit-upon in the office. My social expectations are not being reinforced on me verbally. But then I noticed how society functions.   


It is that they need to do all these things to reap the benefits, that an avg. woman in society has, which an avg. man cannot even fathom.

Women don't need to be so well-dressed in the office. They are allowed to wear simple clothes, every day the same if they want, crew-neck blouses and suits. They don't however. Furthermore, they like their translucent clothes, form-fitting dresses, heels, make-up and all the other nice stuff. I kid you not, last time I was in the office, I saw the panties of both of my colleagues in 4K and one of them also had a visible bra. They garner attention, that they claim later on that it is necessary. No it is not. It is just, that if you choose to dress like a man, you will be getting the attention of the avg. man. That is none. 

The societal expectations (which are being so incidiously differently defined, based on context) are another issue. A woman needs to be thin, beautiful, good mother, successful, rich or whatever else they claim that society enforces on them. Not really. Nobody enforces that on them. They want that, so that they enjoy the female attention. A woman might also be an adipose, she will just have the experience of a man with an average BMI and 20% fat, which is on the healthier side of the scale.   


It is also ignoring the fact, that a man is being born with those and opting out is kinda difficult. It is not easy to work in female-dominated professions (not only because of prejudice and scorn, but also because these professions seem to attack males), it is not easy to stay at home being a dad, it is not easy ""chickening out"", it is not easy having an average income. But yes, apparently women are being brough at such an uncomfortable position if asked about a family plan (which I get, it can be difficult, but then again, it is not a sexist thing). Or women are being driven out of manly professions because they heard a dick joke, whereas men have to live in this brutal environment and not say a word.

They were taken more seriously, were up for promotion, had papers published in journals when they were men, noticed other male colleagues being misogynistic, but not when they were women or transitioned to being women.

MEN AT WORK

**One day in court, Ward and his opposing counsel** were making a big request to a judge. Ward knew their question would not go over well, so he wasn’t surprised when she reprimanded both him and his opposing counsel for asking. What he didn’t expect was for the opposing counsel lean over to him and call the judge the c-word. “We weren’t out the courtroom door when he said that to me under his breath,” Ward says. “He never would have said that when I was female.”

Many trans men I spoke with said they had no idea how rough women at work had it until they transitioned. As soon as they came out as men, they found their missteps minimized and their successes amplified. Often, they say, their words carried more weight: They seemed to gain authority and professional respect overnight. They also saw confirmation of the sexist attitudes they had long suspected: They recalled hearing female colleagues belittled by male bosses, or female job applicants called names.

“If I’m going off-the cuff, no-one really questions it,” Ward says. “It’s taken as, ‘He’s saying it, so it must be true.’ Whereas while I was practicing as female, it was ‘Show me your authority, you don’t know any better yet.’”

Mitch Davis is now a director of organizational development at Planned Parenthood Federation of America in New York City, but he’s worked in HR for many different companies since coming out eight years ago. In one previous job, he heard his boss call female colleagues “old cows” and refer to a middle-aged job applicant as “Dame Edna” after she’d left an interview. “Evidently men say things like that to each other all the time,” he says.

Other trans men say they’ve heard male co-workers sexualize female colleagues when no women are present. “There’s some crude humor, some crass humor,” says Cameron Combs, an IT consultant in Olympia, Washington. He says he’s heard male colleagues do “appraisals” of women in the office or observe how female co-workers used their “womanly wiles” to rise up the ladder, conversations he says he never would have heard when he was a woman. “When they saw me as female, it was kind of an automatic stop,” he says. “It’s a little less censored, the jokes I hear, the comments.”

Some trans men have noticed the professional benefits of maleness. James Gardner is a newscaster in Victoria, Canada, who had been reading the news as Sheila Gardner for almost three decades before he transitioned at 54. As soon as he began hosting as a man, he stopped getting as many calls from men pointing out tiny errors. “It was always male callers to Sheila saying I had screwed up my grammar, correcting me,” he says. “I don’t get as many calls to James correcting me. I’m the same person, but the men are less critical of James.”

Dana Delgardo is a family nurse practitioner and Air Force captain who transitioned three years ago. Since his transition, he’s noticed that his female patients are less open with him about their sexual behavior, but his bosses give him more responsibility. “All of a sudden, I’m the golden child,” he says. “I have been with this company for 6 years, no ever recommended me for management. Now I’m put into a managerial position where I could possibly be a regional director.”

Trans women have long observed the flip side of this reality. Joan Roughgarden, a professor emerita of biology at Stanford and a transgender woman, says it became much more difficult to publish her work when she was writing under a female name. “When I would write a paper and submit it to a journal it would be almost automatically accepted,” she said of the time when she had a man’s name. “But after I transitioned, all of a sudden papers were running into more trouble, grant proposals were running into more trouble, the whole thing was getting more difficult.”

“As a man, you’re assumed to be competent unless proven otherwise,” she says. “Whereas as a woman you’re presumed to be incompetent unless proven otherwise.”

--------------

There is evidence of a growing number of men, who avoid women in the workplace, avoid being one on one, avoid mentoring women. This hurts women. 

https://nypost.com/2019/05/17/men-are-afraid-to-mentor-women-after-metoo-and-it-hurts-us-all-study/

I read a number of articles on that topic. Another example:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/pragyaagarwaleurope/2019/02/18/in-the-era-of-metoo-are-men-scared-of-mentoring-women/

There is a common pattern. Authors ignore and dismiss concerns of men, they give their own explanations of the experiences, feelings and motives of these men, in condescending and scolding manner and shift the topic to empowering women, defeating bias against women and improving career opportunities for women. So basically men should shut up, stop whining and do their best to help women advance. I'd say, it is basically womansplaining.

I know, that feminism is about women's issues, not about troubles of men. That's fair enough, I totally accept this approach. So let's assume these papers are supposed to fix the problem for women, defeat the backlash against metoo. However, let's see what kind of message does it deliver to these men, who are afraid of women at the workplace? 

Men aren't listened to. Their concerns and point of view are ignored. Men aren't entitled to be treated with dignity and feeling of security. Men are an instrument for the advance of  women... 

So if a man is afraid of women, he receives a message that his fears are completely valid.

Edit:

So. How would you approach that problem (men silently ignoring women, because they are afraid)?",WanabeInflatable,t2_16k72e,0.97,1718,370

\- no touching besides introductory handshakes

\- I NEVER comment on their looks, this applies for both positive and negative comments. I don't even do it when they are not around.

\- I never talk about dating or sex with/around them.

There, its that simple. I followed these rules since I started working and had 0 problems or complaints so far.

In my eyes the not following these rules is a risk not worth taking, especially for unattractive guys like myself.

I've heard my female coworkers calling guys creeps for merely attempting what I would judge to be ""corporate friendly"" and politically correct flirting. It only takes one willing to escalate things beyond gossip to ruin your livelihood.

My immediate boss was a pushy woman who did not understand the concept of boundaries. For example, she made telephone calls at all hours. I immediately make friends and one of the people I got very friendly with was a woman - we totally had no romantic interest in each other - and she acted more like a drinking buddy.

For some reason my boss did not like to see this friendship. For example every day, I had lunch with my female friend. But my boss warned both me and her that we were spending too much time together and I needed to spend time with people who were more knowledgeable in the work we were doing.

My boss started to call me over to her office on the pretense of explaining something or asking about progress on some project I was working on but she started flirting a lot and this involved her putting her hand on my thigh, near my crotch. Her language was also vulgar and amongst other things she made 'jokes' like asking me what size shoes I wore because according to her penis size is related to shoe size.

I sent her an email, copied in to our male, gay manager, outlining her behaviour and why I thought it was inappropriate.

I was horrified when I was fired but doubly so when she reported me to the police for lying about her and tarnishing her reputation! Incredibly the police are taking action against me.

Edit: Please understand that I cannot give more detailed information such as location etc. Others are asking me questions like what can the police do... etc. But I would rather not reply publicly as it might compromise my position and my future course of action. I thank you all for your support.

Reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ocxwrc/why_are_so_many_women_unaware_of_the_emotional/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), however, really set me off to writing this post.

""[Emotional labor](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/emotional-labor-in-the-workplace/202004/emotional-labor-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not) is the regulation of one’s feelings at one’s job."" Although, as acknowledged by the article linked, the meaning has been stretched to mean, ""[Women planning things.](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/)""

Both cases of ""emotional labour"" (and all other cases that include its stretched definition) have one thing in common: an abusive woman.

Picture this: You're a husband who works a job, and are trying to help around the house. Good for you, right? Except, before anything else, you'll be [berated](https://www.katykatikate.com/the-blog/2019/5/7/so-you-want-to-help-around-the-house) for not being a perfect mind-reading magician and doing so earlier. 

Then comes the fun part: Nothing you do will satisfy her. You'll be scolded and called ""incompetent"" for getting the tiniest of details wrong. You're not good enough, and you never will be. Not unless you read her mind perfectly, because she can't bother explaining things to you; she shouldn't have to.

Any confidence you had in yourself is gone, and you stop doing those things you wanted to; you always get them wrong, anyways. This is the real kicker: Now you'll be blamed for not doing enough. You're now a lazy bum, a manchild, a mama's boy. You depend on her for everything, and she can't take it, so she takes it out on you. ""I don't have to ask you to help! You should know already!"". That's the part that gets you. ""You should know already."" You should already know what she needs help doing. You should already be doing the thing. You should already know exactly how to do the thing, to the last detail. You should already know all that, and the only reason you don't is because you're not good enough.

But oh no, you're not the victim in all this; she is, because she's doing the ""emotional labour"". Stop thinking your feelings are valid; they're just a manifestation of your ""fragile male ego"" that ""needs constant appeasing"". She doesn't need to caress your ego.

in full disclosure, i'm a white male, in a creative industry that is being regulated and run by media companies with a heavy woke agenda. i've been working my way up the ladder for 15 + years now and i'm constantly seeing job offer listings with the heading ""(BIPOC) preferred."" make no mistake about it, media companies have an agenda to hire diversity. AKA, anybody but WHITE MALES.

women and people of color are being hired with no experience and being promoted up the chain overnight, something i've been working years to achieve. Further, the older white male bosses, know they're in the cross hairs and can be cancelled any minute and are terrified they are going to lose their rarified high paying job, and are as one boss told me ""making me hire"" diverse candidates, over ability, loyalty and experience.

It's not only the corporate media initiatives on the hiring side, but it's also the content - the content is all about women issues, with trans subject matter. So if you have netflix, hulu, disney, etc. you must notice that all your content is starring women and about women's issues and LBGQT subjects, etc.

Nevermind that Top Gun - an arguably patriotic, male, testosterone, action movie has done billions of dollars in GLOBAL revenue for these same companies.

You'll notice the jobs i'm speaking of are not -- plumbers, construction, electrical, truck driving, HVAC -- fields that women have no interest in, that require specialized skill and intensive labor. These are creative jobs where the only SKILL you have to have is be able to feel and relate as a woman or diverse person of color. Experience, skill be damned. The question USED TO BE ""what experience do you have?"" now the question is ""what gender and ethnicity are you?""

Further, my bosses on my last shows were ALL WOMEN (making million dollar salaries). so the notion that women are being subjugated and oppressed and dont have any mobility or opportunities, is patently false.

if i'm my own critic? hey it's social darwinism.  the times are changing, bud!  and get used to it, pal! The patriarchy is over!

but it's a tough pill to swallow. And I am angry and fed up. i'm just a guy who works his ass off and is being pushed to the back of the line because of my gender and skin color.

I'm not sure what to do. I feel like i have to leave my dream and go elsewhere. Become a grey man and disappear. But it's happening. and I'm not sure how to adapt. But I'm in boiling water now and i dont expect it to change.

34,11asgcb,2023-02-24,MensRights,Women need to be called out on their hypocritical use of sexuality in the workplace,"Why does nobody has the balls to call this out?!

Women use their sexuality in work and work related settings ALL THE TIME. When they want a favor from a coworker, when they need help, when they are looking for a raise or promotion, when they are trying to get a new client/customer.

I had several dates with highly successful beautiful business women and they all laughingly admit of flirting and leading coworkers or clients/customers on in order to get that sale, promotion or just get it ""their way"". Had a date where the female CEO said if the client is a man, she sends one of her hot employees, always. And i myself -of course- over the years first hand have seen women get all girly and sexy, start using their cute girly voice when they need a favor or whatever. Its so blatant and normal, everyone knows it.

Yet women flip the fuck out when a man tries to be flirty or tries to use sexuality in their favor. They act like its an  unthinkable immoral crime that needs to be punished. If you ask women if sexuality belongs in the workplace, they all say ABSOLUTELY NOT. Yet they use it every single fucking day. Hell women told me they dress sexier for clients when they want to get a deal/sale. They flirt, they drop sexual suggestions only to later shoot the man they led on down. This all would be fine...if they weren't hypocrites that literally try to cancle and destroy men who dare to flirt back or god forbid initiate a flirt.

Coworker or customer flirts with woman at work = Oh god look at that creepy piece of shit. He should be reported and fired, this doesn't belong in the workplace.

People think its weird when men enter female dominated industries particularly psychology and social work, teaching (at least k-8 grades), healthcare administration etc.   


When it comes to manual labor jobs like construction trades there is zero call for women in those industries but when women work in them they get the same big deal treatment they get in the IT areas.

When women enter male dominated spaces they tend to be the center of attention and treated special. When men enter female dominated spaces they tend to be ostracized or used for heavy lifting and grunt work.

38,b04wtm,2019-03-12,MensRights,Lost my job because I was targeted for being a white male,"I'm a 33 year old white male, and I am a mental health counsellor. I worked on a team with 4 other females, all counsellors/social workers/etc. On that team was a 23 year old who made her opinions about men very clear. Back in August she presented my manager with a list of things that I had said that offended her. I had no idea I was saying anything that offended her. There was about 6 things on this list, and many of them were just me expressing a different opinion than her. It was certainly never my intention to offend anyone with these opinions, and they weren't racist or sexist or derogatory. I've shown this list to many people, including many women, some of whom said they disagreed with some of my opinions, but none said they were worth complaining about. What's worse is this individual took the things I said, and twisted them, either misquoting them or taking them completely out of context, to make me look a certain way. I don't think she did this intentionally, I do believe this is what she heard me say as my words went through her filter. 

She took it to the manager, who is a female and has also demonstrated having a negative bias towards men. For this reason, I was not offered the chance to tell my side of the story; I was ignored when pointing out that I didn't say these things the way she is saying I did. I was offended, and pointed out to my manager that other people on the team, including the woman who presented this list and my manager herself, have made comments that I could have complained about should I have wanted to. My manager has also commented on my appearance more than once, which is sexual harassment, and I reminded her of this (although I didn't put it that way). I stated that I felt this was incredibly hypocritical, but it didn't matter; I was sent to anti-racism anti-oppression training, one-on-one with a trainer chosen by my manager. I showed him the list, told him my side, and he said, in his professional opinion of doing this for 20+ years, that he felt I'm being singled out and I'm being sent to this training to be ""fixed"" so I'll go back to work, shut my mouth and be quiet. He believed this was a team issue being turned into a me issue, and I agreed. This was in September. In November we met with this trainer as a team. It was uncomfortable. I expressed my fear of sharing an opinion that someone disagrees with lest it be held against me at a later time. But we did the training, and things went back to normal. My working relationship with this young woman was never the same, but it was civil. 

Flash forward 3 months, when I am sitting in my office waiting for my first client of the day, and my manager and an hr rep entered my office and told me I am being let go because I ""don't fit in"" and that my ""views are better suited elsewhere."" It was out of nowhere. I had been so careful with everything I had said since August. I received no warning, no investigation, no opportunity to fight for my job. It was decided.

I have dedicated my life to helping others. I do not discriminate against anyone, quite the opposite in fact. I help individuals of all genders, sexual orientations, races, religions, ethnicities, ages and so on. I help many people who have been discriminated against, oppressed, or stigmatized. But I was on a team with a 23 year old female who only ever saw me as a white male, and she targeted me, and she was successful. She has had an impact on me financially, on my career, and a severe impact on my mental health. I hate her, and I hate my biased manager who handled the situation different than she would have if the roles were reversed. This is a scary time.

Edit: I should have mentioned I consulted an employment lawyer. He is a friend of a friend, so I trust him and his advice. He said that although I likely have a case of discrimination, he strongly suggested I don't take legal action on the basis of discrimination, due to the fact that I am straight, white and male. He said that win or lose the case, it would reflect bad on me, particularly in the field that I work in.

The list:
-age (she was the youngest on the team by 10 years. Myself, and the rest of the team, would occasionally playfully tease her about her age. I never once put her down because of it. At a team meeting she asked all of us to stop it, and I know I did. And yet, it still made the list) -he said that questions about power and privilege on interviews are useless (in fact, I said ""I didn't see the point"" but I was referring to one specific case, but that's a whole other story. But she generalized it, and that was not my intention or meaning nor my words) - mat leave (the women on the team were having a conversation about how the US was cutting parental leave time and were talking about how sexist it is. I said I don't think it's fair to call it sexist because, although it disproportionately affects women, it affects all genders who would take parental leave) -said he wanted another male on the team; ""there are too many of you and only one of me"" (at a team meeting we were talking about hiring a new person for the team, I suggested we consider hiring another male as some clients request male counsellors specifically and because I felt it might add some more diversity to the team. I was often shut down very quickly if the women on the team did not agree with my opinion. I certainly did not say the words she put in quotation marks) -you look nice (said to her ONE TIME in the year I worked with her before she gave this list, because she got dressed up for a presentation and I was just trying to be nice. I didn't think anything of it. I certainly wasn't hitting on her or flirting with her, and again, it was a one time occurence)
-he is aggressive when his point is not agreed with and does not take into account other people's feelings (in fact, I would often be shown aggression from the females on my team. When I suggested hiring another male, the 23 year old snapped at me ""you can't say that!!"" and she clearly did not take into account my feelings.

I'd be interested to get a total breakdown of all causes of work related diseases and deaths.  I'm sure it's 70%+ across the board for men, if not 90%+.  And at only one third of the total, this probably represents around 2.26 million fatalities a year.  Other causes besides accidents on the job are chronic diseases like black lung disease and mesothelioma, which mostly affect men.

I’ve been working at my job for the past two years, i was happy for the first year and a half. But the past six months have been hell and mainly that has in my opinion been caused by my boss’s boss who is female and her push for “diversity.” Our job is technical in nature but also requires the ability to lift heavy objects. This has made it a male dominated office as we can do both roles, technical reports and field inspections and the heavy lifting. We had women who worked there but they moved on to other jobs, they were great at it and we lost two great employees. 
     Our department head who has never done the job before decided in her infinite wisdom that we need more “diversity” as in we needed a specific gender regardless of qualifications. This has led to an absolute dumpster fire that culminated in a new hire that we just got accussing me of sexual harassment because I was according to her “too nice” and must have ulterior motives. She wrote this in an email today to my boss at the end of day in our air conditioned office while I’m outside sweating and working myself to death. She is planning on getting pregnant and now cannot work outside or do any lifting even though the job requires you to be able to lift 40 lbs. We would have gotten another guy who had expierence and skill in the field we work. 
     But my boss was overridden by the department head and a committee of four women somehow inexplicably also picked a women instead of the guy who had qualifications. She has also accused another of my co workers of “flirting” with her and he now refuses to talk to her and leaves the room when she shows up. I am going to apparently follow suit to not have to deal with this craziness. There is more with the other women who work in our office but I’m not going to go into detail here.

48,15qgwv7,2023-08-14,MensRights,Workplace Gender Discrimination?,"Hello! I was hoping someone could tell me if what I’m experiencing is actually discrimination and worth going to HR. Apologies in advance as it's very long:

The entire division went away for a team offsite to do training, team building, etc. During the second day we had what they called speed dating where one side would rotate and you’d have 2 minutes to connect with each team member. When the division head and I had our 2 minutes, the first question she asked me was how is married life. I responded that it was great. The second question was why did you get married. I immediately felt uncomfortable. When I responded that I love my wife and wanted to begin the next chapter of my life with her, she responded that doesn’t seem like a reason to get married. She then asked me how long did you date your wife before you got engaged and when I responded she said that doesn’t seem like a long enough time before you proposed. I felt even more uncomfortable and I tried to change to subject and asked if she has any travel planned in the near future. I told my manager at a team dinner later than night and she said that’s ridiculous she would ask you that question but otherwise brushed it aside and didn’t escalate.

Later during the offsite, we had breakout team dinners where groups of roughly 10 people were aligned with 2 team leads for dinner. After everyone’s dinners, many people met at a bar. I saw a team lead inappropriate touch and essentially hit on lower-level team members. One of the team members felt violated and screamed for him to stop and she came over to me to essentially save her. I was one of the few sober people there and tried to control the situation. There was another team lead there, but he didn’t do much to control the other team lead. The next morning, the woman and I made a comment to our manager during lunch and the manager went to HR to raise this issue. During the next two weeks, my manager would regularly say to me in our 1:1s make sure when you get interviewed by HR, you say the full story of what you saw and also share how the team lead made everyone feel. It was as if they had a personal vendetta against him before this incident and they wanted to get rid of him. I’m definitely not saying what he did was appropriate. A week later, the division lead pulled me aside in the lobby before we went our separate ways. She said, I’m not sure if you are quiet in your personal life but you can’t act that way at work. You should have stepped in and stopped the team lead at the offsite. When I explained that there was another team lead there, she cut me off and said I don’t care it’s your responsibility not his. I responded how I attempted by telling the team lead to stop and how the woman came to me but the division lead cut me off saying you don’t need to say anything else; I’m just telling you not to act professionally the way you might act privately outside work. I felt very uncomfortable, bullied, and it was as if I did something wrong. I was interviewed by HR about the incident with the woman and after explaining the story, she made it very clear I did nothing wrong and if anything, it was the other team leads responsibility to get involved and the fact you did more than him speaks volumes. A few weeks later, the team lead that was inappropriate was fired.

A few weeks later, I had a 1:1 with the division lead scheduled for 15 minutes. Everyone on the team had these 15-minute syncs scheduled over a few months. I came prepared to the meeting with a list of numerous questions such as giving her an update on what I’ve worked on and accomplished recently, asking what was on her radar for the next quarter for a leadership level and also if there was anything I could help her out with or further help the team, I asked if she had any recommendations for me in terms of developing my career at the company. For all of my questions, she gave one-word answers and it was very obvious from her expressions and not paying attention that it was the last place she wanted to be. When I asked about career development at the company, she told me “you don’t get it and you should get on a project”. When I told her I’ve told my manager for the past couple of months that I’d like to get on a project, she said oh and that was it. I still to this day don’t understand what she means that I don’t get it especially since all of my reviews, goal results, and feedback have been strong. The 1:1 lasted 6 minutes even though it was scheduled for 15 minutes. I asked others how theirs went and the women said she gave lengthy responses and was helpful while some men I asked said it was as bad as mine. I mentioned to my manager that my 1:1 went poorly and she said she wasn’t surprised and will try to do damage control whatever that meant. I asked my manager if she thought the division lead had something against me or if there was gender discrimination. She said I know she gives men a more difficult time than women and that there is a treatment level difference between genders. I was very shocked but not surprised based on everything I’ve seen.

Also, the sub-team I’m on is only women and me. My manager seems to treat the women on the team, most who have been with her for many years, significantly better and works to get them promoted multiple times over since I’ve been here over the past 2 years. Also, my manager has made statements over the past 2 years on other men mansplaning things to her and also her issues with how many men there are compared to women at the company and how she wants to try and balance it out.

I also want to say, the division lead and my manager are extremely close and I know this will be held against me and also she won’t admit to things in order to protect the division lead.",jf8617,t2_500v2568,0.9,31,18

The CEO likes to joke, and he mostly just said this as an observation, not as any sort of policy shift.

However, when he said this, all of the women in the office had a comment to the effect of ""Well of course it's mostly women, it's PR!"" Essentially saying this is a job for women, not men, although maybe not so black and white. 

*For background, I am the only man that has been hired in the last year at this company. Roughly 10-13 women have been hired in the same period.

I was not offended by these statements, but I noticed that this is an attitude that has gotten a lot of men in business in trouble over the last few decades, particularly in fields like finance. And since there are several women in my office who are feminists and very sensitive to statements like this coming from the other direction, I thought it was pretty hypocritical and telling.

I mentioned this to a girl in my office that I'm friends with and she was taken aback, as she didn't even realize she/they had that attitude until I pointed it out, but couldn't deny I had a very good point.

I'd love to hear if anyone here has thoughts/similar experiences.

Edit: To avoid having to respond to like 10 different comments individually, I figured I'd just lay out my beliefs on this matter in general, as well as within my company:

I was in no way offended by what happened in my meeting, I was more amused, as I find hypocrisy amusing to point out. Most of the women I work with are great people, and most (once again, most) are great at their jobs. In fact, some of the women in my office are consciously harder on the girls in my office that have more of a stereotypical ""girly"" personality, as they feel it affects their professionalism.

I 100% do NOT feel discriminated in my workplace because I'm a man, and my gender has definitely not affected my success at the company (that I'm aware of at least, but from my recent performance review they are very happy with what I'm doing).

Generally, as some below pointed out, I totally agree that some fields are more appealing to one gender over another, and frankly I am sort of lucky, as some of the girls I work with have said that, at past PR companies that they have worked at the women composed 90-100% of the employees. 

Frankly, I think gender roles are more of a social issue than a professional issue, and that people should simply be hiring the best people for the job, regardless of gender. Not to be callous, but it's BUSINESS.

Mainly because: **(A)** Feminists seek leverage over men and **(B)** Because they think leadership is not a masculine trait. 

To be fair leadership is not a male only trait but IS a masculine trait meaning a woman with strong leadership skills is far less likely to also be a feminine woman. Look at Angela Merkel for example, not the peak example of femininity now is it? 

Which also means all the divas in leadership positions are there just for the trophy and likely were put in there by men to begin with because..they are women, they're pretty or something. I am an office worker I have no problem working with women if they deserve to be in the spot.

You dare to challenge her - First she hurls word-salad at you, then insults, then just downright discredits. Prove her wrong and she starts throwing every imaginable ism, accusation, dagger she can at you.

67,134yvsg,2023-05-01,MensRights,The 'gender pay gap' is a myth. It should be called the 'gender earnings gap'.,"The so-called ‘gender pay gap’ is one of the central tenets of feminist doctrine. Of course, in one sense, it is a fact. Estimates vary, but on average, women will earn about 75-85% of what men earn over their lifetimes. We might more accurately refer to this as a gender earnings gap than a gender pay gap, but whatever you call it, I won’t argue. It seems pretty clear to me, and I don’t doubt the statistics. The question is whether or not it matters. If one can reasonably extrapolate from those figures that women earn less than men purely because of workplace discrimination, then that’s an issue. But the correlation between gender and lifetime earnings is nowhere near as simple a picture as feminists make out.

The idea most frequently conflated with the gender earnings gap is that of unequal pay. The notion that women are paid less than men for doing the same work is often—implicitly or explicitly—touted as the reason women earn less. But paying one gender less than the other for the same job is illegal, and it has been for over fifty years. Indeed, if it were possible to pay women less than men for the same work, one would expect businesses to reduce their labour costs by employing more women. But that’s the opposite of what happens. 

On average, even the women who work 'full time' work far fewer hours than men, and this is just one of the many reasons they may earn less over a lifetime. They also choose different careers from men, are less likely to do dangerous jobs or relocate for a higher salary, and tend to prioritise other things, like children and family. None of this has anything to do with the relative amounts men and women might be paid for doing the same work. The difference between equal pay and the gender pay gap is important and seems straightforward enough, but the deliberate conflation of the two concepts is ongoing, and many feminists are desperate to keep it alive.

Take the Fawcett Society’s ‘Equal Pay Day’. This is described as “a national campaign led by Fawcett Society in the UK. It marks the day where women effectively on average, stop earning relative to men because of the gender pay gap.” In the US, the Whitehouse itself is in on the act, which it does to highlight “how far into a new year a woman must work, on average, to earn what a man did in the previous year.” In 2023, it was March 14th. The justification for this is that “women working full-time, year-round are paid an average 84 cents for every dollar paid to men.” 

The implication is that throughout the workforce, and with consistent and predictable regularity, employers are breaking the law by paying women 84% of what they pay men for the same work. But is that really what’s happening? How could such a flagrant disregard for employment legislation be taking place on such an enormous scale, and all through the relatively quantifiable, traceable conduits of taxable salary payments? The answer is that it’s not. Women are not being paid 84% of what men get paid for the same work. They can’t be, because they’re not doing the same work. 

Amongst the top female-dominated jobs in the US and the UK are nursing, childcare, and secretarial work; amongst the top male-dominated jobs are construction, plumbing, and vehicle maintenance. In the US, the annual mean wage for all occupations is $58,260. Out of the top ten female-dominated professions, all but three pay an annual mean wage which is lower than that, and the annual mean wage for the top ten female-dominated professions combined ($50,581) is almost ten thousand dollars lower than the national mean. On the other hand, five of the top ten male-dominated fields pay higher than the overall mean, and the average for the top ten male-dominated jobs comes in at $59,643, or in other words, $1,383 higher than the overall average.

The average annual pay in the UK is £31,285. Again, only three of the top ten female-dominated professions pay more than that, compared to five of the top ten male-dominated professions. The top ten female-dominated professions in the UK pay an average of £26,925 for 35 hours of work; the top ten male-dominated professions pay an average of £30,451 for 48 hours of work. The Fawcett Society takes care not to highlight facts like this on Equal Pay Day, but it’s worth noting that in the UK, not only are men working longer hours, they are actually getting paid a *lower* average hourly rate than their female counterparts.

So what does all that tell us? Men and women pick their careers with some predictability along gender lines. Men work longer hours and get paid more overall, although their hourly rates aren’t always better. They also do some of the more dirty, dangerous jobs that women don’t like. Similarly, women tend to do things men don’t like. These jobs often require fewer working hours and offer more flexibility. That’s hardly a fashionable thing to say, and I am by no means advocating for adherence to traditional gender roles, but the statistics reflect a freely exercised choice, and remain true whether you like them or not. 

This element of choice is crucial when discussing the gender earnings gap with any nuance. Another key element is age. When you bring age into the equation, you realise how much of a blunt instrument those much-touted ‘gender pay gap’ statistics are. Longitudinal studies tracking the trajectories of professional men’s and women’s careers over time have shown a negligible earnings gap for the first ten years after university. Around ten years in—which coincides with the time most graduates start having families—a divergence between average male and female earnings starts to set in. Feminists waste no time in concluding that this is due to sexism. But could it be that women at that stage in their careers just have different priorities in life?

In a recent Yale study of management-track employees from a large retail chain, researchers lamented the failure of higher-ups to promote female employees. In their abstract, the study's authors rush to conclude that this is due to hiring managers' inability to recognise women's leadership potential. Yet the researchers also found that female employees were less likely to accept promotions when they were offered, citing longer hours, less flexible working patterns, and potential relocation as barriers to acceptance. Indeed, when isolating promotions requiring relocation, the ‘gender promotion gap’ was significantly more pronounced. The researchers’ data also showed that men were more likely to leave the firm to look for promotion elsewhere if they were passed over internally. In other words, more men than women were prepared to secure a higher salary by committing to work longer hours, enjoy less flexibility, and undergo the upheaval of leaving the company or moving home. 

It may reasonably be deduced that not only do women tend to choose different careers from men, but they may also exercise greater freedom of choice when navigating those careers. Should work and family issue competing claims for their attention, they at least have the option of picking between the two. The element of female choice is often missing from the gender earnings gap debate, presumably because it might make the gap look like a good thing for women.

Another frequently absent point of discussion is the financial pressure upon men starting a family. Whilst it is perfectly obvious why a new mother might want to work less, it is equally logical, although less commonly talked about, that a new father might feel he needs to work *more*. The financial anxiety that comes with children can be terrifying for men, not least in a society where high-earning careers are touted as a birth right attendant upon ‘male privilege’. However, when men do pursue advancements in seniority and salary, their actions are often attributed to an ugly desire for power and domination. 

Yet the average man is not an individual economic entity; he exists as part of a household structure which commonly includes a woman, and she benefits as much as he does from any advancements in his career. This particular elephant in the room is often ignored, but cohabiting heterosexual couples are the norm, particularly amongst those who have children. As such, the amount of money a woman earns and the amount she can access are not the same. The average married woman is hardly likely to oppose her husband seeking a pay rise so he can provide for their children. In doing so, rather than embodying the stereotypically selfish, domineering corporate pig, he may be seeking greater financial reward out of a sense of responsibility, duty, and love. And it so happens that the time this becomes most pressing for him is the time that many women are pulling back from their careers. It will be an unpalatably congenial thing for a feminist to admit, but when viewed this way, the divergence in male and female earnings after a decade of work seems to be less about female subjugation than it is about female choice, male sacrifice, and familial cooperation.",AntifeministWisdom,t2_9hdlhwt2k,0.94,485,99

NBC highlights a series of quotes by both men and women in post MeToo era.   

The women give mostly vague answers.   Some of them say they feel more ""empowered"".   

A few of the men say it hasn't affected them, however the majority are as follows: 

""I minimize my interaction with women now and under no circumstances will I be in a room alone with a woman again."" 

""I won't say anything to a woman about her clothes, shoes, hair, etc.""  

""I have always been respectful of all co-workers, but after MeToo, I find myself avoiding social interactions entirely.   I've become more disconnected than ever."" 

""I am more cautious around women.   I try to not look in their general direction anymore…I tend to imagine that I am interacting with a male co-worker or a sophisticated AI, a machine if you will.""

""I no longer feel comfortable joking around with [women] about any topic, as these days they can say anything feels like an unwanted sexual advance.""   

""I can't do anything anymore.""  

""It made me a little afraid to say anything to female/male co-workers that they may take it the wrong way and scream MeToo.   I find my conversations are much shorter than they normally would be.   They are strictly about work and nothing else.   No questions about family, friends, what they did over the weekend and things like that.""  

""I keep all interactions and discussions with women as short as possible and limited to work-related topics only, with no joking around.""  

""Even before MeToo, I would not meet with students in my office with the door closed.  Now, many of my colleagues will not allow a female students alone in their office even with the door open.""  

""No more young people of any gender can go on trips with management.  People who do travel together must also be the same gender.   We also cannot sit next to each other on the plane.""  

""No meeting with women in my office.  No one-on-one meetings with any women.   No more walk-and-talk meetings with women to the coffee shop.  When traveling, I will no longer coordinate to be on the same flight or sit next to a female co-worker.   No hugs for anyone."" 

""Everyone's afraid of being falsely accused of something.  The 'human factor' has disappeared…There is no sense of friendliness or warmth anymore so that nothing can be misconstrued."" 

So to summarize: the relationship between the sexes in the workplace is now ice cold.   The ""human factor"" is disappearing, and many men are clearly uncomfortable even engaging in small talk with the opposite sex.    

Some men and women have been subject to actual sexual harassment in the workplace; and men responded to these complaints several decades ago by introducing various anti-harassment policies.   

Feminists have not improved matters.   Instead, they have succeeded in creating a hostile work environment for ALL workers.     

Women will themselves be negatively affected by these trends.   However, one quote from the article anticipates that feminists will not take responsibility for their grossly irresponsible behavior, and instead blame -- you guessed it -- the patriarchy.   

""I am a woman and MeToo has screwed me.  In Silicon valley it is really hard to get time with VCs [venture capitalists], so you do whatever it takes.  A lot of time that would be meeting them at a bar in the evening…It is good networking and that is how I got my initial seed funding.   But now no one wants to meet with a woman under 40.  Even in the office they won't be alone with you.

I had to hire a social media manager for my gaming company. Basically you make some Facebook and Twitter posts, and collect 50k a year. 

After some telephone screenings I offered an interview to one girl, she was a 21 year old student working a minimum wage job at the time. It was great opportunity, good money, flexible schedule, etc. She told me her only day off that week was Memorial Day. My building is closed on this Holiday, but I was going to work through it anyhow, so I scheduled the interview. She e-mailed me a hour before the interview to tell me she had taken a last minute shift and would not be able to make it, and would like to reschedule. I told her that there was no rescheduling, and that this job was a big opportunity for her. If working in the gaming industry is truly her dream job then she should prioritize her schedule accordingly. I told her if she had changed her mind, or had a lunch break or something, that she could drop by and I'd still give the interview.

The next day my company got a call from her mother, who claimed that I was very unprofessional, that she had given a fair warning for cancellation, and I should have rescheduled. She further said that I had no right to chastise her daughter, and that I was a disgusting evil man. She went on to say that I should be fired, and that her daughter should be given my job. When my manager refused, her mother said that she would call the press and claim that the real reason why her daughter didn't show up was because she was afraid that I was going to rape her. That it was weird that I'd offer an interview on a Holiday (it was her daughter who suggested this date).

The solution? She wanted another interview. So I gave her another one. Of course I didn't hire her, but we gave it to her.

So now, we still have the position open. I was thinking of offering the position to a 23 year old grad student, who had a pretty decent interview. The only issue was that during the interview, it almost felt like she was interviewing us, as if we were ""bidding"" with another company for her services. She even scoffed at one of our questions, as if it was""beneath"" her. But, she had a good resume. I just wanted a quick 10 minutes phone call to ask a few more questions, mainly to calm my initial reservations about her ""entitled personality"". 

I emailed her and told her she was a finalist, and that I just had a few more questions to ask her. If she was available for a quick 10 minute phone call. She replied very professionally, that she was very interested, and provided a list of 5 different times and dates in which she'd be available for that phone call...the closest one being 5 days away.

I was shocked, that this student of all things, would not jump at this opportunity. If it were me, I would have jumped on a phone call right away. So I replied back ""I'm not asking for your availability, I just need a 10 minute phone call.""

She replied back that ""She was no longer interested in the position."" The next day, she called my work, and complained that I was unprofessional and had insulted her. She showed the e-mail to my manager who then promptly laughed at her. At this point, we decided not to interview anymore ""millennial women"".",kluh100,t2_p883o,0.85,52,55

Notice how 93% of workplace fatalities are still men.  A fact that men apparently do not get compensated for.

~~The math is pretty simple, though not obvious at first:~~

~~$1 / ($1 + $0.77) = 0.56~~

I think this shows pretty clearly what the largest factor in the earnings gap is.

Of course the fact that men have to work longer hours than women is itself a problem. Paying for dates and bills for your girlfriend / wife isn't exactly cheap. Not to mention that many women look for men who earn more money, thus creating an incentive for men to sacrifice their work-life balance in order to earn more.

I guarantee most men would love to work fewer hours and spend more time at home but the spending and earning patterns of their partners don't often facilitate this.

This also contributes to poorer health outcomes for men and the fact that men die 5 years earlier than women on average.

**Edit:** Graph is fine, title is misleading.  The 77 cents per dollar thing is likely just a colloquialism at this point.

95,14767pt,2023-06-11,MensRights,False Title IX allegations costed me my on campus job.,"These event played out from fall of ‘21 to the spring of ‘22 (March). This is a long post so please follow through with it all for backstory purposes.

Going into my senior year of college, I finally landed a position in my university’s housing department that I desired since 2020. (Pre-Covid, actually). The position was called a “Resident Director” or RD for short. I started out as an resident assistant (RA) in spring of ‘20 and got promoted entering my senior year in the fall of ‘21 after a two round interview process with our live-in professional staff and our directors of the department. I was placed on a alternate list because graduate students were given priority for the position. But thankfully, I received my offer in April of 2021. Looking back now, I should have just saved myself the stress and heartache and denied the position.

The resident director position at the time offered a $700 monthly stipend for 10 months, a free two bedroom apartment in the dorm building you were assigned to, a private office, and staff parking. The position now actually provides a scholarship on top of the already mentioned amenities.

So, came July of 2021 and I was very excited to begin the job. The position requires the holder managing the front desk in the assigned dorm building. The RD was required to hire, train, and oversee student desk assistants to work at the front desk. 

I begin to hire and assemble my student staff, it was very difficult as I had no senior staff with me as the one who was assigned to my area quit before the year started. I had to run almost everything on my own in the beginning. 

The first month, I get called to my what should have been my boss’s boss office. Upon arrival, I am told I am on probation due to an sexual harassment allegation from what I thought was a friend who came over to my apartment to hangout. She wasn’t title ix so she could not tell me what exactly the allegations were. I left her office in disbelief  and shock. but nothing came out of it as I was told, the complaint, my former friend chose not to move forward the case with title ix office. It was considered the case be closed at that point. She sent me a text, asking her to never contact her again and then she moved to the other side of campus to work as a desk assistant at one of the dorm buildings on that side of campus. I never responded to her text. 

The next couple months went by relatively easy, everyone got along with each other. The department hired a new boss for me though him and I didn’t see eye-to-eye on things. It wasn’t due to any underlined allegations, but simply due to a difference in management style. he ended up getting fired in January 2022 for work performance reasons. 

It was then going into the semester of the spring of 2022 I began having issues with my desk assistants. Some of them weren’t doing simple things and tasks  that I trained them on and instructed them to do multiple times. I would often have to threaten them with write ups for failure to execute their job functions. Keep in mind. I was a student myself in my senior year trying to do what I needed to pass all of my classes and graduate. It was very stressful and taking a toll on my mental health.

Finally, while at my internship off campus, I receive an email from the assistant director of housing, informed me that that due to new allegations of sexual harassment, racial discrimination, and another issue, that I totally forgot about, I was to be placed on suspension with pay immediately pending investigation of the sexual harassment and racial discrimination allegations. 

Fast-forward a few days after that initial email I am asked to report to the assistant director of housing office to have a meeting regarding these allegations and dis suspension overall. Upon arrival to her office, she again informed she get informed me of the allegation. It was at this point she informed me that she was Going to terminate me based off an incident that I had with scheduling one of our RAs to work at their mandatory desk hours that they have to work for their contract when they were out of town. This was solely by accident and I owned up to it, and the RA himself accepted my apology for the error. It was at this moment I chose to resign from my position to which she accepted without hesitation. Then, it appeared that she tried to get into confess to the allegations to which they included, staring at one of my female, desk  assistant’s breasts, making another female desk assistant uncomfortable because I was always there when she was there even know the hours she worked, was during in my office hours. After a mild heated discussion, she gave me three days to move out of my apartment And that concluded my nearly 2 years of service to the housing department at my university keep in mind I had no formal allegations of any kind nor any write ups for a bad work performance before I became a residence director. This decision to terminate me was most definitely made in an attempt to cover the department should informations the allegations become viral.

Had I not had my girlfriend to move in with as she lived in the city, the threat of me being homeless was very real. Nothing came of the allegations after my resignation. I did not hear anything from the universities title IX office, nor did I hear from the office of student conduct regarding the racial discrimination allegations. They simply vanished when I tended my resignation. I graduated without incident and now working a full-time job making over 50 grand a year. however, these allegations are still taking a toll on my Mental health, and I’m considering visiting a therapist.

Sorry for the grammar errors as I am on mobile.

101,12daegv,2023-04-06,MensRights,I am so so very tired from the overtime I need to work because of women in the teams I work with who aren't functioning. I'm working until midnight day after day and into the weekend week after week. It's all a lie. Almost no woman I work with who has a demanding position actually works. I do it all,"Such women have the degree (I have it too) or a title in the email signature three-four words long.  Equal, no? Well no. Most of the time, almost always, she won't have a clue on how to do the work her job requires. They will spread confident statements that will sound knowledgeable but if you actually know what they are talking about you will know it's complete nonsense - mistakes and fabrications - they are simply making it up (instead of simply looking it up). It becomes obvious to you after a while that they see their competence not as being skillful, experienced and as a result very effective - but as being good at throwing around the right ""buzz sentences"" to make it look as if they are someone you can trust with that job. They will send you their ""completed task"" and it will almost always be half baked. You will need to do your share - and 50% or more of theirs, you will need to spend more time on fixing problems they created (by never asking how something is done and instead ""throwing something""), and then you will find out that while they know you are leaning over your computer at 10 pm working to fix it, they are out of office.

These ""a woman can do anything a man can"" women, holding ""same position as a man"", simply create a facade, a theater show. Mostly the only thing equal to a man they have is the job title and degree - they don't actually have the knowledge, know how to do the job or put in the effort needed, rather, the ""equal number of women"" in such positions is made possible by men doing their own 100% and then 50% of the women's work.

This is the reality of it all. Not all women in these positions are like that - absolutely not! I worked with bright, hard-working, responsible, knowledgeable women (""knowledgeable"" means: being responsible enough to spend time looking for all the needed knowledge and making sure you really understand it, instead of relying on mumbling something and on someone else ""taking care of it""), who will hold their end of the pole with you and won't let go until it's in place, but they were a rare sight. In nine out of ten cases, it would be sleepless nights, no weekends, to do the woman's part and then some (as for men, my experience was that they do their best - each according to his capacity.

Maybe knowing this pushes men to deliver while women might get the opposite message - we need you for the body count so as long as you don't shoot a missile at the office you won't get replaced\]. And if men don't know something they just say it and ask, instead of inventing nonsense that create problems that you need to then solve. Them not minding their ""ego"" and simply asking for instructions saves unimaginable amounts of time). Has anyone else had this experience? Any doctors or engineers here who can tell how it works in their field? (I'm so tired).",Henry_Blair,t2_9k62bs9x,0.89,166,60

You will be given no chance to defend yourself. Testimony from other parties proving your innocence is irrelevant.  

No matter what lengths you go to in order to make sure you are covered in the event of a false allegations is also irrelevant.

I have 3 teenage daughters. I was raised by a single mother. I respect everyone until they individually acted in a way that does not warrant that level of respect.. Men, women, somewhere in the middle it doesn't matter. Specifically in the workplace. 

I know where the lines are. I do not text female coworkers from my personal phone. If I have to text them outside of standard business hours, I use my work phone. 

Before I send a text, I take the time to think how each text could be interpreted when all context is removed. This applies to emails, face to face interactions, everything. 

I make a point to never to be alone with female coworker. Ever. Whether it's a corporate sponsored event or not, I never want to be in a he said/she said situation. Err on the side of caution. Always.  

The MeToo movement reemphasized the importance of being extra conscious with regards to women in general, specifically women coworkers. Especially when you are in a position of leadership. 

Turns out, none of that matters. 10+ years without so much as a blip on HRs radar, I was terminated for inappropriate behavior. I was accused of telling my administrative assistant I was going to fuck her. The event where I allegedly said  this, I didn't even attend. Come to find out (because I have friends in HR as well as friends that work with her husband) her husband thought we were ""getting to close"" so he told his wife to either get me fired, quit, or he was going to kick her out. He even went and bragged about it to people he apparently did not know I knew.   I will get to how this had already come back to haunt him in a bit. 

In the end none of it mattered. I was terminated on the spot. No severance, no pension, just ""mail us all your equipment and fuck off"". 

Luckily the industry I work in is huge, but very tight-knit. Word traveled fast despite HRs best efforts to say I was terminated because I did not agree with the RTO policy. (There was no RTO policy)

I'm not trying to toot my own horn, but I am well known in the industry. Just about everyone (thay matters) saw through this the moment they caught wind of it and since my non-compete and non-solicit were voided, it ultimately turned out to be a blessing in disguise, but I am still having trouble getting past 1 thing.

How can a man with a spotless record, multiple testimony from others that not only I would never say that but I WASNT EVEN AT THE EVENT THIS ALLEGEDLY TOOK PLACE get terminated because of a single unsubstantiated allegations?

When I read stories about professional athletes of celebrities who were ultimately blacklisted due to false allegations I always thought surely there is more to the story. 

Not anymore. 

TL,DR; I am struggling to come to terms that your career, character, integrity can be destroyed by a single allegation. Everything else is irrelevant.  Proof you weren't at said event means nothing. If a woman accuses you of something in the workplace or not. Corporate sponsored event or not, you're done. 

Imagine how that conversation went with my daughters? Without a doubt the hardest thing I have done in my life even though they know I do not act or talk that way. 

How do you come to terms with this and ultimately get past it? Frankly, I am terrified to work with women. I work in a male-dominated industry, but my point still stands. No matter what lengths you go to to insulate yourself from potential allegations, it ultimately doesn't make a difference. 1 accusation of saying something I didn't say at an event I have proof I never attended is all it takes. 

How do you accept this and move forward?

I’m not joining the club. 

I can’t take you seriously if the word entitlement isn’t paired with responsibility. Start explaining what you are responsible for. 

I don’t care if you wear a bra. Why is this still a thing ? Do what you want. 

I don’t need to hear anything related to your reproductive cycle, we are not a couple so why do you feel like sharing publicly. Sharing is not caring. Your body is your business. 

If you take the time to creat list and be thoughtful do it silently. Telling others about the emotional labor you endured takes away from any generosity you supposedly offered. 

If women are still too sexualized it’s because too many of your sisters are looking for  a short cut. Deal with them, not me. 

If a man shares a thoughts or a feeling let him finish it. Talking isn’t a competitive sport. Emotions are real and not icons in your chat app. Let a man express himself  once in a while. And listen once in a while. 

And lastly, if men are so bad why do you glom onto them as if they are owed to you. No man owes you anything, least of all a relationship if he isn’t ready for one. Or if you are not the one.

In reality, women are compensated *more* than men for *less* work, and a stronger argument can be made for *men* being the ones who work more for less. 

- women receive more tax benefits despite paying an equal individual tax rate

- women benefit from early pension ages, which men must pay for

- women receive more healthcare funding, despite living longer

- the court system favors women

- the education system favors women, and women receive more scholarships

- employment laws favor women

- there are more social and welfare programs available for women

meanwhile, men must do more work, and for less

- in many countries, men provide free labor via conscription/national service

- in many countries, men have a higher pension age, meaning they work longer to pay for women's early retirement

- men receive less tax benefits and social programs

- men's health receives less funding

- men have less access to public housing and homeless shelters

- men perform unpaid manual and physical labor

- men perform jobs with the highest rate of death

In regards to 'emotional labor', this is an example of feminist doublethink. Feminists present the concept of 'toxic masculinity' an the primary explanation for men's problems.

I generally always said lines like:

- “big shout out for my man that worked hard for this sports event 

- “ you are my man for this job “

- “my man “

 You get the idea ..

And keep in mind that if it was up to me I would use the same terms even when it comes for female co-workers (but it would be sound absolutely like  sexisms and boy-man culture)

For example:  imagine if I would use the exact same terms for women! 
I would loose my job the next day  but at the same time here where lies the paradox.

I feel like my hard work has been wasted because I don't feel comfortable with the culture there while everything else is amazing.

There have been some pretty nasty things said on the central IM system by one person. People who agree defend the comments, more often others who are uncomfortable just stay silent or get on with their work.

I am scared about saying anything because it will jeopardize my working relationships, but these comments really irritate me because I know that someone is there making the world a worse place. It puts me in a bad mood and affects my work something awful.

I try to ignore this person as much as possible when it comes to non work things but since the IM system is required for work it is difficult to ignore.

I'm half blowing off some steam, half looking for advice because I can't help getting annoyed when I have to deal with these people every day.

Here's some of the comments, from memory:

* Someone retells ""sudo make me a sandwich"" (xkcd.com /149) in text form, changing characters to ""boy"" and ""girl"" just for the sake of having characters. Followed by angry comments how its sexist because of the mere mention of a girl and a sandwich must be a reference to the old trope, with support from two others directed at the story teller.

* ""Why do the male programmers stare at me, they're weird and disgusting"" - totally untrue, she works in a separate room and wears loud boots causing attention when entering the programming area.

* She tells a joke involving a doctor and a patient, and someone comments on the patent, using the pronoun ""he"". She proceeds to have a hissy fit saying ""funny how you assume it's a man, cause only men can die right"". This one enraged me because 1. of her over-reaction and 2. I don't see a problem with men identifying with a male character. It's sexist to force someone to override their natural identification. More women characters represented in media, movies and games = good. Forcing someone's self identification to be something it's not = bad.

* And finally, in my opinion, the worst was when my (male) boss said ""someone's got a small penis"" in reference to someone revving a car really hard outside, she had a rant about how ""only men drive cars right"" and completely ignored that the comment was an occurrence of casual male body shaming. This shows she doesn't really care about equality, if that wasn't already clear.

Since this is my first job out of college, I don't really know how to handle it apart from trying to ignore everyone and distance myself. This puts me at a disadvantage because of the social life that the company promotes is supposed to be good for networking. I might just look for somewhere else in another industry, it's really not worth working in the corruption of the entertainment industry.

I also want to point out to her credit that there was one instance that her outrage was arguably warranted (Someone immediately asked to ""speak to the manager"" because a woman in our company picked up the phone, and although the story was told second hand I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt), however she ruined it by directing to the men ""that's for all of you who think sexism doesn't exist anymore"", and taking the default stance that all men treat women as second class citizens.

EDIT: Thanks for all of the advice. I will keep recording these statements if they continue the way they have been. I will ignore the comments, and not let them bother me, by assuring myself that my records can and will have a positive effect eventually, while trying to be a valuable employee and nothing else.",throwaway85930458,t2_ogtxu,0.91,43,66

Why should a woman  receive even a dollar more than a man just because she is a woman. I don't know how much the voucher is and I do not care. I don't need a miserable voucher. That is not the point, it's the principle. If we get paid the same, women would still be receiving more just because they are women and for no other reason, not because they are better, not because they are smarter. Imagine you being paid 1000 and a woman being paid 1000 and she still receiver more due to special privileges. Women are given advantages all the time for whatever reason just because they are women. Now imagine if men were receiving something entirely based on their gender, and on top of that, that being institution and repetitive, do you imagine the outrage?

128,9blgkc,2018-08-30,MensRights,"I'm tired of women who get pregnant, disappear from the company and when they get back expect everything to be the same while men have to bust their asses working...","Yes, it sounds sexist, but I don't really give a f* at this point.

We work on a competitive field, and I've noticed that marernity leave is treated as a ""get out of work for a few months"" jolly card and many of these women come back after 5 or 6 months and expect to have their careers untouched. I'm not talking about being able to have paternity leave (which men have), I'm talking about the indifference to men when it comes to career responsibility: women can drop everything and disappear untouched. Men don't.

In my experience, men cannot just take 1 or 2 months of holidays and expect nothing's going to change for them at the job. Don't get me wrong, I know having children isn't holidays, but it's still a choice, just as would be going on vacation.

What's even worse: if I want a vacation, I have to schedule it and it needs to be approved. If a woman gets pregnant, she's (and rightfully so) under no obligation to schedule it or getting it approved, she would just one day drop into the office and announce it, and everything and everyone will have to re-shift priorities for her.

Equality is equality. We deserved to be treated the same way, not be expected to carry the company's weight while women keep going in and out for this issue. We had 6 different women disappearing in the last 2 years and it's been hell. I almost couldn't even go in vacation to cover for shifts, and I'm not the only one. How is this fair?

What I'm trying to say is, while I'm all for giving women the current set of rights they have in regards to having children, shouldn't the companies give men some sort of similar treatment or benefits that would reward them if they *don't* want to have children but still want something else from life?

But hey, try telling a woman who went on maternity leave for 5 months that she no longer holds the same position in the company and it's hell... sexist, misogynist and unfair. Sure, like the guy who had to cover for her, who now has to step back or get fired, so that mommy can get back on that horse!

This isn't the middle ages: women can *decide* to have children, and they have to *choose* to give stuff up, just like I would have to give stuff up if I *decided* to go on a 3 months cruise. But no, it's treated as an untouchable right of the human being. Besides, who cares, there's always some men around to do the work for them while they are away, right?

And don't even question it, otherwise you are a misogynistic prick... Equality is equality. You wanted the same rights, so deal with it: if you choose to disappear to have children, then you also choose to let your career go for that time, and don't expect to be treated like it never happened when you come back!

130,14p55pz,2023-07-03,MensRights,"Debunking the ""Gender Pay Gap""","Copied from the [original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TraditionalMuslims/comments/14p3dwq/debunking_the_gender_pay_gap/).

So I didn't think I needed to debunk this as it's been done a million times before. However, it's come to my attention that apparently some still believe it. So, just to have an easy-to-reference, codified treatise on the issue, I'm writing this piece to utterly decimate this commonly propagated liberal trope.

Mainstream media presents [articles like this](https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-wage-pay-gap-charts-2017-3) that claim there is a pay gap between men and women, and that it's on the sole basis of gender. While it is true that men tend to earn more money than women, it is absolutely false that it's due to gender bias in favor of men (if anything, it's actually in favor of women). The problem with the statistics shown is that they only take into account median yearly salaries without accounting for any other confounding variables that may be skewing the data. For example, if I told you that the more people drown the more often ice cream is sold, would you take that to mean that ice cream causes people to drown? No, you'd probably say that it's because of ice cream sales increasing in the summer when it's hot, which is simultaneously when people go swimming more, thereby increasing the likelihood of drownings to happen; this shared commonality (i.e. the heat) is a confounding variable.

For the so-called ""gender pay gap"", here are the confounding variables:

1. This statistic does not account for what types of jobs are being worked, as **men choose higher-paying jobs**.
   * [*Source 1.*](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.1120.0757) *Demonstrates how women choose different jobs than men because they value and/or prioritize different things than men (e.g. better work-life balance). Because of this, the jobs they prefer tend to be lower-paying.*
   * [*Source 2.*](https://academic.oup.com/oep/article-abstract/57/3/479/2361925?redirectedFrom=fulltext) *Same as Source 1, but also found that ""job satisfaction of men increases with additional earnings while that of women does not"" (p. 486).*
   * [*Source 3.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719) *Landmark study; displays evidence that men choose higher-paying jobs. The more egalitarian/feminist a country is, the fewer women choose careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (i.e. traditionally male-dominated roles). Giving greater career choice to women increases (apparent) gender disparities within the workforce.*
   * [*Source 4.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2525981) *Cited over 11,600 times. Demonstrated very directly that women choose jobs that are lower-paying, and that women are NOT being paid less to do equal work; and this was in 1973, almost 50 years ago. Please note that any discrimination found thereafter is really just residual unaccounted variability rather than actual discrimination per se, as detailed in the conclusion.*
   * [*Source 5.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243210361475) *So ignoring the ideological bullshit that's indirectly being pushed, it demonstrates clearly that women choose different jobs than men and that it is solely due to their own choice; and that the only time women don't choose traditionally female jobs over male jobs is when they're essentially forced to take the male job.*
      * *Interestingly enough, this supports the findings of* [*this study here*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719) *(which was a MASSIVE, catastrophic blow to the ""men and women are equal but female oppression and gender discrimination are the only reason why we aren't"" narrative); the researchers found that the more egalitarian/feministic a society is, the greater the gender differences will be (regarding what people will choose to pursue). In other words, when you give women free choice to pursue whatever they want, they will willfully choose occupations/education/life goals that will only increase the gender gap between men and women.*
2. The statistic does not account for **different positions within a respective field** (e.g. head/lead developer vs senior developer vs junior developer; they're all developers, but different rankings/positions). We know this because it's not possible to know the relative rankings/positions of people's careers if they don't even know what those careers are in the first place.
   * [*Source 6.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1808858) *Looked at a company from the years 1966 and 1969-1971; found no gender discrimination when accounting for all variables. States that at most, there may be gender discrimination with regards to promotion, but even this is speculative as it is not explained why this may be the case (and truth be told, we already know why this is; I will explain later on). If the concept of a gender wage gap was already being debunked/disproved back then, it definitely doesn't exist now (at least, not in favor of men anyway...).*
   * [*Source 7.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30038574) *Studies a company that was sued for ACTUALLY discriminating against women with regards to promotion, and found that there wasn't any pay differences between men and women who were given the same job/assignment. In other words, even when discriminating against women, they were still being fair about the pay.*
3. The statistic does not account for **age** (e.g. a young person may make more money than an older person in a physically-taxing field, older people in fields that would require more knowledge/wisdom to handle, etc.).
   * [*Source 8.*](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26623) *Generally speaking, workers over age 40 are only about half as likely to get a job offer as younger workers if employers know their age*
4. The statistic does not account for **job tenure** (i.e. how long someone has been working for their respective employer for).
   * [*Source 9.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122413514584) *Shows men in general have greater job tenure than women. It's decreasing overall (particularly for men) but there are various reasons for it, many of which are oftentimes advantageous from a career/monetary standpoint, which men are going to be more receptive towards since men typically prioritize money more than other aspects of a career (see Source 1).*
   * [*Source 10.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831432) *It's in the title; job tenure typically entails higher wages. In recent times, this has been changing within certain fields (hence why it's been decreasing as shown in Source 8 above), but the point still stands overall.*
5. **Men work more than women**, which implicates in the previous 2 points with men being able to develop greater job tenure and work experience. More men work full-time than women. Moreover, the term 'full-time"" means anyone working 35 hours or more (with some lowering it to 30 hours or more to further skew the stats in favor of their social agenda); this could mean anywhere from 35 hours to 135 hours per week, and I can tell you right now that the vast majority of people who are working an exorbitantly high number of hours are men, NOT women.
   * [*Source 11.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2015/time-spent-working-by-full-and-part-time-status-gender-and-location-in-2014.htm) *Statistics from the US government. Men simply work more than women, even when comparing men who work full-time to women who work full-time, and men who work part-time to women who work part-time.*
   * [*Source 12.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2019/pdf/home.pdf) *More statistics from the US government for 2019.*
      * *""Among full-time workers, those usually working at a job 35 hours or more per week, men are more likely than women to work more than 40 hours per week. In 2019, 25 percent of men who usually work full time worked 41 or more hours per week, compared with 14 percent of women. Women were more likely than men to work 35 to 39 hours per week: 10 percent of women worked such hours in 2019, while 4 percent of men did"" (p. 8).*
      * *Women were more likely to be working a part-time job than men.*
      * *""Women who worked part time made up 23 percent of all female wage and salary workers in 2019. In comparison, 11 percent of men in wage and salary jobs worked part time.""*
   * [*Source 13.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2020/pdf/home.pdf) *Even more statistics from the US government for 2020.*
      * *19.6% of men working full-time worked 41 or more hours per week, compared to only 10.2% of women who were working full-time. This means that men working full-time were nearly twice as likely as women to work 41 hours per work or more (Table 5). This coincides with* [data discussed at the 2019 G20 Summit](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---cabinet/documents/publication/wcms_713376.pdf)*.*
      * *Men working full-time were also 2.3 times more likely than women to work 60+ hour weeks: 4.3% of men worked 60 hours per week or more compared to only 1.9% of women.*
      * *Women working full-time were more than twice as likely as men to work shorter workweeks of 35 to 39 hours per week: 7.7% of full-time women worked those hours, compared to only 3.6% of men who did so.*
      * *Men working 35-39 hours per week earned only 92.4% of what women earned working those same hours ($600 median weekly earnings for men vs. $649 for women). This means there was a 7.6% gender earnings gap in favor of female workers (for that cohort), and this is BEFORE accounting for any confounding variables!!!*
      * *Women were more likely to be working a part-time job than men.*
      * *Although not reported by the BLS, it can be estimated using its data that the average workweek for full-time workers (in 2020) was 41.3 hours for women and 42.8 hours for men, meaning the average man employed full-time worked 1.5 more hours per week compared to the average woman. This adds up to men, on average, having worked an additional 78 hours per year compared to the average full-time female worker.*
      * *Some of the raw earnings gap naturally disappears by simply controlling for some of the variables. For example, women technically earned 82.3% of median male earnings for all workers working 35+ hours per week (i.e. full-time). But for those workers with a 40-hour workweek (more than three-quarters of all full-time female workers), women earned 87.4% of median male earnings, and that's after accounting for just one variable: hours worked.*
      * *For young, full-time workers aged 16-24, women earned 94.7% of the median earnings of their male counterparts. Once again, controlling for just a single important variable—age—we find that more than two-thirds of the ""gender pay gap"" disappears. There are tons of other factors like these that go unaccounted for when you hear people/the media talk about the gender pay gap. Keep this in mind from now on.*
   * [*Source 14.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2008/02/art5full.pdf) *Conducted by the US government. Looks at 12 European nations and shows that men work more than women in all of the countries studied, among many other things.*
   * [*Source 15.*](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t04.htm) *Government statistics for 2021. Men clearly work more than women.*
   * [*Source 16.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00197939211045376) *Some people may not think that men work more than women enough to help warrant the pay gap, but this paper explains otherwise (they basically accounted for the jobs being worked and how men and women vary in the number of hours worked within these specific jobs rather than ignoring the types of jobs worked).*
6. Building off the previous point, **men work more overtime**, and the gender pay gap statistic does not account for overtime pay. And if men are working more hours than women, that means that men are going to make more money from overtime which is higher than your standard base rate.
   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *This is one of my favorite studies ever. It's just so well-done and is, in my opinion, the epitome of what research is supposed to look like. It was conducted by Harvard University, and one of the authors is literally a woman (meaning there isn't any bias caused by sexism or misogyny on behalf of the authors). It demonstrates a multitude of things, but as it relates to this specific point, it shows clearly that men work more overtime than women (p. 2–3; Figure A.16, p. 85).*
7. **Men are more likely to accept overtime, and especially when presented without prior notice** (e.g. if someone had an emergency and couldn't come in, and employees are asked if they can stay, men are more likely to accept it). This means men tend to be more reliable workers overall. It's technically a separate point from the one above because the frequency of accepting overtime is different from actually working it (e.g. someone could work a lot of overtime one week and not work it at all for the next 12 weeks, vs someone who works only a few hours of overtime every week).
   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *Also shows how men are more likely to accept overtime when it's presented to them and that men in general are especially more likely to accept overtime without prior notice (p. 3; Figure 6, p. 49; Figure A.17, p. 86).*
8. **Men are less likely to have unexcused absences.**
   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *Women have more unexcused leave of absences than men (Figure 22, p. 65). This further implicates men as being more reliable workers. What's ironic is that men face harsher penalties/disciplinary measures than women (Figure 21, p. 64), contrary to popular belief.*
9. The statistic does not account for **work experience** (i.e. how long someone has been working in their respective field).
   * [*Source 18.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2535309) *In general, men have greater work experience than women (courtesy of working more than women); the timing of work experience and overall work matters a lot as well, and since men are simply working more than women, the advantages of this timing will be more apparent in men than women. This study has data directly showing that men have greater actual work experience, potential work experience, and job tenure than women (the last of which relates back to the previous numbered point).*
10. **Men do not get pregnant and are less likely to leave work for kids** (e.g. paternity leave); pregnancy forces women to stop working, which relates back to points 4, 5, 8, and 9, and men being less likely to leave work for kids also shows more dedication to work.
      * [*Source 19.*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwao.12506) *The abstract alone states ""mothers with young children have reduced their work hours four to five times more than fathers"". Some of you may say that this therefore nullifies Source 12 as supporting evidence for point 5, but it actually strengthens it because it exemplifies the gender differences that can cause a skew in the gender wage gap myth and highlights the behavioral dimorphism between the sexes. At most, it would only nullify SOME of its generalizability on a year-to-year basis, but even then, it still showcases how statistics can be skewed/misrepresented to provide a false narrative about gender discrimination that doesn't actually exist with regards to pay. Anyway, Source 13 also states similar as well due to the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) where women are far more likely to leave work/not come in, but I don't want to be redundant and keep using the same source even though it's a fantastic study.*
11. **Men are less likely to take sick days.**
      * [*Source 20.*](https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/68/5/320/4973626) *Women take more sick leave than men, even after accounting for many variables.*
      * [*Source 21.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6070205/) *The introduction alone is enough to show that women take more sick leave than men, this is undisputed and has been for decades. This study sought to determine whether there were differences in attitudes towards sick leave based on gender, and whether this contributes to women's absenteeism. They did not find much support for this, indicating that women take more sick leave regardless of societal norms and expectations.*
      * [*Source 22.*](https://journals.lww.com/joem/Abstract/2015/08000/High_Job_Demands,_Job_Strain,_and_Iso_Strain_Are.5.aspx) *Women take more sick leave due to mental health reasons than men (p. 860), with 90% of ""mental health"" reasons being either stress, mood, and/or anxiety-related.*
12. **Men are less likely to take vacation days.**
      * [*Source 23.*](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1019.5400&rep=rep1&type=pdf) *Great study that shows how women take more vacation days than men, while also discussing why it is the case. Has several other findings/key points that showcase male-female dimorphism as it relates to work and the family, and they are very interesting; they essentially prove what is already self-evident with regards to gender roles, despite what mainstream society is trying to push today.*
13. **Men are more likely to move for a job.**
      * [*Source 24.*](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol40/53/40-53.pdf) *Shows conclusively that men are more willing to move for a job. They try to say that single women are just as likely as single men to move for a job after accounting for confounding variables, but that's nonsense because one of the variables was essentially how well they like the job (i.e. ""job characteristics""), when the location of a job doesn't have an impact on how much the job itself should or should not be liked (and if any of you researchers disagree, you will need to account for the Halo Effect to fully make sure that distance isn't what's making them view those same ""job characteristics"" as distasteful enough for them to not want to move). It's as if they're trying to say that jobs should cater to women by changing how they operate so women will like them better, rather than simply just acknowledge that women do not want to move for work as much as men. In fact, it's not even as if they're saying that, they literally suggest it lmao! It's very gynocentric when you look at it. The reason why they say this is because they do not want to admit that the gender gap is literally caused by women's own personal preferences, because then that would mean that the gender gap is normal, natural, and that women willfully make the choices that cause the gender gap, essentially nullifying any narrative that women are victims of oppression and that the gender differences that exist between men and women are caused by men and women ACTUALLY being different. This last point really irks the ideologues. In addition, it would place accountability over the gender gap on women, and women absolutely cannot handle having accountability.*

      * [*Source 26.*](https://web.stanford.edu/~niederle/CEN_discrimination.pdf) *This one has some progressivism within it as well, but ignoring that, we find that any discrimination against women isn't due to them on the sole basis of them being women, but rather because of beliefs over how well they would do the job. In fact, it shows that people are MORE likely to favor women as job candidates when a negative belief is ascribed to a woman rather than when it is ascribed without the gender being stated. In other words, gender discrimination isn't gender discrimination at all but rather performance discrimination, which is the definition of a meritocracy (i.e. a system in which people are judged based on their merit/how good they are at their job, rather than characteristics unrelated to said job/merit).*

18. **Men are more interested in jobs that are scalable**; men are more interested in physical things, while women are more interested in jobs that deal with people. The former is scalable, the latter is not; that means Elon Musk is able to service millions of people with Tesla whereas Mrs. Johnson is only able to teach a class of 30 students per year. This point is separate from the first point because scalability relates to potential growth/earning, and based on the laws of chance, you're more likely to find some major hit successes in professions that are scalable rather than unscalable.

19. **Men are more likely to ask for a raise.**
      * [*Source 45.*](https://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/16689) *Men are more likely to ask for a raise; the only exception is when women enter managerial positions (i.e. are put in male roles, basically). It also shows that women are basically worse at negotiating than men (""less successful"" = euphemism for being worse at).*
      * [*Source 46.*](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1994) *Women are only as likely as men to ask for a raise when they are explicitly told they can negotiate for one. I can tell you right now that most jobs rarely ever directly tell its employees that they can freely ask for a raise lol.*
      * [*Source 47.*](https://escholarship.org/content/qt9978v172/qt9978v172.pdf?t=omys3w) *Women are less comfortable engaging in salary negotiations, they're less likely to negotiate salaries overall, and they're not as good at it as men (the researchers don't word this last point this way because it angers feminists, but that's the gist of it). There are many other reasons that they go into as well.*
20. **Men are typically more aggressive/competitive in their mindset and attitudes regarding work** which helps them climb the corporate ladder more (e.g. you make more off commission in sales because you close more sales due to being more competitive).
      * [*Source 48.*](https://archive.bio.org/sites/default/files/docs/toolkit/Why%20Men%20Still%20Get%20More%20Promotions%20than%20Women_HBR%20article.pdf) *Upon reading this, you find that women are essentially not as willing to do what it takes to climb the corporate ladder; the report says that therefore the entire civilizational structure should change to favor women, but that's just ridiculous. Why not just admit that women are not as willing to hyperfocus on their careers in the same way as men? Why not just admit that women don't do it because they simply don't want to sacrifice other areas of their life for a career? Why not just finally admit that women are different from men? They can't. And that's a problem for BOTH genders.*
21. **The top people are always going to be men due to the variability hypothesis.**
      * [*Source 49.*](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/493921) *Men vary greater than women; when seeing any of the extremes, men are more likely to be represented on both ends. That means the most successful people in the world are going to overwhelmingly be men, and the most unsuccessful dregs of society will also be men. This represents a problem with feminist thinking because they want ""equality"" when it comes to powerful, important, and successful positions in society and say that a lack thereof in these top positions are due to sexism and discrimination (and that therefore all of men and society need to just give women these positions to ""make it fair""), but they will never talk about the men at the lowest ends of society or talk about equalizing that. I'm not saying they should become homeless criminals and whatnot either (rather they should focus on decreasing the amount of men that are disenfranchised here; but they'll never do that since they would have to admit that men aren't oppressors and would have to actually acknowledge the plights of men), I'm just saying there's a double standard here whereby women want the rights and privileges of both sexes with the responsibilities of neither, all the while blaming men for any (and all) of their own shortcomings and faults.*
      * [*Source 50.*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886913003036) *Men vary more than women yet also tend to be better on average on measures of creativity.*
      * [*Source 51.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variability_hypothesis#:~:text=The%20variability%20hypothesis%2C%20also%20known,most%20traits%20than%20females%20do.) *For those who still don't get it, here's a Wikipedia article since they tend to describe things fairly simply and succinctly.*

Just to really drive home the point, I quote the official statement of the US Department of Labor after having a massive [study](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2019/pdf/home.pdf) conducted for them:

>**This study leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a multitude of factors and that the raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action. Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers.**

And even ignoring the technical research aspects, just think about it like this: If a woman were to do the same job as a man for less pay, only women would get hired because that would be CHEAP LABOR. And for those who don't know, there's a whole sexism argument that claims men get hired more easily than men (which also isn't necessarily true either, but that's a separate discussion).

There isn't a single statistician who isn't braindead, let alone competent, who takes the statistics presented about the gender pay gap myth at face value when drawing conclusions. It's only after you account for all the variables available can you really begin to extrapolate true causality, and even then it is still weak with these types of statistical analyses anyway since it's virtually impossible to account for every variable that exists *and* have a full consensus for data rather than a statistic that has a much smaller sample size. Plus, when it comes to statistical analyses like this, you're ultimately seeing how things relate to one another (i.e. correlated) rather than seeing how they directly influence/cause something. The only way to truly test for causality is by running actual experiments with strong controls in place (which is nigh on impossible to do in situations like these). If you take a statistics class or two, you'll learn about this stuff more in-depth. Multivariate analyses are pretty much always better than univariate ones (when drawing final conclusions from, anyway), and it's due to reasons like this where society perpetuates the gender pay gap myth as a social dogma.

If women can do anything men can do (and ""do it better""), then why are they still supposedly ""oppressed""? Why are they still the victims? And why do they need government legislation to mandate ""gender equality"" in order to achieve it? If they were really the same as men (i.e. ""equal"") in all these regards, wouldn't perfect equality naturally occur based on merit alone? It doesn't make sense, and it's simply because it's just not true. Men and women aren't the same, and we won't ever be the same. That doesn't mean we shouldn't be treated fairly—equity over equality, always—but this myth needs to die once and for all.

132,iyiami,2020-09-23,MensRights,May have lost a job because I am male,"For context: I am a 25 year old male. Fresh out of grad school and planning to apply to physio school this year. I applied for a job as a physiotherapy assistant because with my kinesiology degree, minor in rehabilitation, years of relevant work experience, master's degree studying how pain effects movement, and being a certified personal trainer since I turned 18 I figured I should be plenty qualified to teach people exercises. I also thought it would help me get a good reference for physio school

I get an interview for the job and it goes great. They basically decide based on my resume that I'm a perfect fit before I even go to the interview. I go in and sign the paperwork and they tell me come in on Monday for training. They would like me to primarily be a physio assistant but also run to the front once in a while if there is a phone call or something. 

I walk in on Monday and the lady who runs the front desk who I am supposed to be shadowing tells me she is surprised that they hired me because, as someone who also has to do some work at the front desk, it's strange that they didn't hire a woman because women are so much better at it than men. Weird start but whatever. I spend the whole day working with her, learning how to bill people's insurance, greeting people as they come in, answering the phone, calling patients to make sure they didn't forget about their appointments, etc. I was attentive, I asked questions to clarify things, didn't make any mistakes, overall I thought I had a very good first day. She tells me come back in on Wednesday for more front desk training. Cool. 

Today they text me first thing in the morning and ask if I will come in an hour and a half early. Sure! I can do that! So I go in early and the head physiotherapist sits me down in one of the treatment rooms and explains that whoever is at the front desk is the face of the company. When people come in or call it's the first person they interact with and the person at the desk is responsible for keeping those clients coming back instead of going somewhere else. Without the right person at the front desk the business will fail. 

They decided that I am more than qualified enough for being a physiotherapy assistant and they bet that I don't even need any training I could just start. However, they need someone who is also good on the front desk so they have changed their mind and they will be hiring someone else instead and they sent me home. 

On my way out I tell the lady at the front desk that they said I'm not a good fit for working at reception and she reiterates that it's true because I'm not a female and laughs as I walk out the door. 

Did I just lose my job for being the wrong gender? I thought everything went so well especially since I was hired primarily to treat patients. Then I get called in and totally blind sided that I'm not a good fit for the position even though I thought everything went so well. Am I being overly analytical? Or did I actually just lose my job because I'm a man? 

TL:DR: Started a job as a physiotherapy assistant. Office manager makes a comment on my first day it's weird that they didn't choose a woman. Next day find out they changed their mind about hiring me and I'm fired",Thepolander,t2_xjcpj,0.98,396,55

**WWI**

&#x200B;

>Beginning on 23 October 1916, deportation went into effect as official policy in all of German-occupied Belgium.

&#x200B;

>Belgian mayors had no interest in sending the best workers to Germany. Many mayors simply refused. Several were arrested and fined for noncompliance.105 In towns where mayors provided lists, the Germans had unintentionally given them wide latitude in the use o f their new power. Because the Germans provided no specific test of “unemployed,” the term was open to liberal interpretation. As a result, the lists given to the Germans routinely included the chronically ill, criminals, and derelicts. Most o f those deported in the first weeks were physically unfit Meanwhile many unemployed ablebodied men were shielded from deportation by mayors, who made them special constables or special members of the CN.

&#x200B;

>Likewise, men who were only recently employed were assumed to have been hired only to avoid deportation and were taken anyway. Men who were unable to prove that they were too young or too old were deported.

&#x200B;

>The most complete account of the selection process was a report given to the American minister in Brussels on 17 January by foreign service officer Christian H. Herter. According to this report, the 4 January deportation from Mechelen (seat of the Cardinal o f Belgium) took three days. On the first day all males between seventeen and fifty-five presented themselves at a central station: “ ... each man must bear his identity card and \[was\] allowed to bring with him any documentary evidence which \[could\] go to prove that he \[was\] actually employed or unfit for hard labor.”

&#x200B;

>Nonetheless, impressive numbers of men were conscripted. Official figures given to the Belgian Parliament for total deportees indicated 58,500 from the Central Government and a further 62,155 sent to building projects in the War Zone. The official German figures vary. One set, which take no account of deportations from the War Zone and run only from 23 October 1916 until 20 January 1917, gives a total of 58,432. According to other figures the total number was 61,000. The official 1928 Reichstag report sets the total at 66,150. Although there was disagreement about the exact number, all estimates fall within this eight thousand deportee variance.

&#x200B;

**WWII**

&#x200B;

>During the spring of 1941 the occupation government began to force changes in Belgian social legislation to make contract labor in Germany more appealing. The first change was lengthening the work day in coal mines to 10 hours so that fewer miners were required.

&#x200B;

>Hendriks held that all men had the obligation to work and that if there was insufficient work in Belgium they should emigrate to Germany.

&#x200B;

>Individuals who refused compulsory work within Belgium were classified as “asocials” and those who stopped reporting to the job site or left Germany before their contracts ran out were classified as “contract breakers.” In unilateral violation o f all the 1940 agreements Hendriks saw to it that all “contract breakers” and “asocials” were refused unemployment benefits. The only way “asocials” could be rehabilitated was for them to volunteer for work in Germany. Theirs was the choice between penal labor in Belgium or “voluntary” work in Germany.

&#x200B;

>During the next two years Belgian labor was conscripted in three phases. The first, a short-lived continuation o f “combing out” with compulsory deportation, ran from fall 1942 into mid spring o f 1943. By the beginning o f 1943, however, the pool o f skilled workers had begun to run dry. In the wake o f the February defeat at Stalingrad, the Germans began to revamp the Arbeitseinsatz, shifting from combing out to simply conscripting Belgian workers by age group. Men bom in 1920 and 1921 were drafted for one year’s mandatory service in Germany. Initially combing out and birth year conscription overlapped, but this overlap ended on 6 September 1943, and in a virtual return of First World War methods workers were dragooned by age. Each stage was more nakedly compulsory and less successful than its predecessor.

&#x200B;

>The peoples they respected least suffered the greatest deportation o f their female populations. The largest percentage o f women deportees (51% o f the total) came from the despised Soviet Union. The lowest percentage (3% of all deportees) came from Germany’s former ally Hungary.  
>  
>15,000 Belgian women volunteered for labor in Germany. Later, a further 21,826 were conscripted, so that women comprised 11% of all Belgian deportees. In contrast to men who were sought for their skilled labor, most women were unskilled: their labor was less sought after and relatively poorly paid. The overwhelming majority went into domestic service. There was also a sizeable contingent in the textile industry.",SamaelET,t2_711hdpbk,0.9,17,3
134,n0jarm,2021-04-28,MensRights,All female management and HR forced me out of the company after reporting harassment,"This happened three years ago at a small company and it still has been weighing on me. It was one of those ""we're one big family"" tech companies who prided itself on having beer in the fridge and a ""great culture"". 

The management structure above me was my lead (female), mid level manager (female), direct manager (female), and department head (male). The HR department was 3 people (all female). For what it's worth, I am also an ethnic minority and all the women in management were white women. 

Myself, a female colleague, and another male colleague were all up for a promotion. The only one that walked away with a promotion was my female colleague, despite myself and my male colleague being there far longer (I actually interviewed and made the call to hire the person who was promoted). The company had a formal list of criteria needed for a promotion, so I created a list with evidence for every bullet point and sent it to my manager. She refused to even glance at it and told me my accomplishments were not relevant. Weeks later I pleaded with her to go over this document and discuss my career goals. She flipped out on me, called me all kinds of names, and then stormed off. 

I went to the head of the department and explained what had happened. He was shocked at the behavior and had no idea what was going on in the department. He scheduled a meeting with the three of us and she tried to lay into me again, but instead her boss chewed her out for unprofessional behavior. He then saw my list of accomplishments and decided I was definitely in line for a promotion and I was promoted not long after, along with my male colleague. I thought it was over. Boy was I wrong.

A few months later the department head left the company and was replaced by a female department head (so the entire management structure was female). My boss held a grudge and it was open season on me now. But this time she stepped over the line and harassed me over email with direct language about a disability I have. This is blatantly illegal so I went to HR. 

They immediately defended her and tried to gaslight me. Everything I said they tried to counter, until I presented them with the harassment in writing. I stood firm and knew my rights and they backed down. What transpired after that was 6 months of retaliation (I spoke to a lawyer and he said there's not much you can do until they fire you). 

Constant belittling, talking bad about me to other coworkers, turning people against me. Every 1 on 1 meeting we had was recorded (something she never did to anyone else). Every time I pushed this up the all female chain of command it fell on deaf ears. Eventually I left the company, just like they wanted. My position was filled by my boss's female friend. I am told by someone that still works there she had been badmouthing me behind my back for over 2 years.

Keep in mind this is a company where other female employees openly said they discriminated against men. They host and sponsor feminist events. They openly say their pride themselves on hiring women. 

When I reported my manager for harassment, it was me against a clique that openly made it clear where they stand, and that stance was firmly against men. This just showed me that harassment against men is real, and when the deck is stacked against you there is little that can be done.",LivingVideo,t2_347f3m8v,0.99,1998,213

I’ve been here for about a year or so and I’ve had multiple situations where I was discriminated against because I’m a man. I’ve shared about my struggles with PTSD due to my time in the military and one of the women in my office weaponized my vulnerability and used it against me by saying “well you know all about taking brain pills” nothing was ever done with that situation and I was told to keep my mouth shut and be diplomatic about it. On multiple occasions I was getting thrown under the bus by a different department manager for something I never did. So I told the owners and managers that I’ve been targeted and truly feel that way. After a few days they pull me aside and ADMIT that I was being targeted. Soooo WHAT THE FUCK ARE YALL GONNA DO ABOUT IT? Just today my professionalism was called into question because I jokingly told another employee to shut up. I’m not sure how this whole discrimination works in the workplace but I do feel like I have a case here,Expensive_Bag9228,t2_8e2pxnyn,0.91,16,3

I’m afraid for his future, what will wait him?

What I see now is other women nitpicking situations to blame it all on men.  

I recently had issues with workplace harassment from my boss, no not because I’m a woman, but because he’s a jerk on a power trip: Calling me up to 27 times in 1 hour knowing I was at the emergency room for having fallen down a flight of stairs.   Assigning me to projects that had already been taken care of  then blaming me, and even going as far as saying on a private message that me wearing a bikini on Facebook was unprofessional and not dignified of a worker from this prestigious multinational company.  Finding the most minuscule things and blowing up in public...

It’s not because I’m a woman, he’s an absolute cunt to everyone.  He wanted me to leave the company instead of firing me.  

But funny thing is, when I asked for help from all these associations for women , all they wanted to know was if my husband abused me, if my husband beat me....  otherwise they wouldn’t help.   

They asked me to file it as a sexual harassment from my manager and I refused, because it’s not sexual harassment, it’s just this idiot on a power trip bullying me so I quit the job. 

I could ruin this man’s life just by lying and the whole feminist movement would back me.

That’s absolutely disgusting.

So because I refused this, I was denied any legal help.  

I’m not trying to sue, I don’t want money... I just want my manager to back off, take some interpersonal skill courses... I want him to stop creating an impossible workplace environment for everyone.  I want my SJW company to actually be just and not back him up because it’s easier to not move him to another team.

137,ys0kj,2012-08-24,MensRights,The sexism coming from the women in my workplace is astounding.,"We were having our Friday lunch together in the office, as we do every week, and a conversation came up about the new CEO of Yahoo and how she was pregnant but not taking maternity leave. I decided to note that the husband could take it instead, which I thought would be a great idea since she's clearly got lots of work ahead of her.

In comes a comment from an early 20-something, ""It's not the same."" ""Yeah, it is,"" I replied, casually and informatively. ""It's not at *all* the same,"" she responded.

The conversation quickly shifted at that point, which was for the best. Had we stayed on that topic, I think tensions would've run incredibly high. That was about 6 hours ago now, but the moment still resounds in my mind angrily and with contempt. That she, an unwed, child-free woman would so quickly dismiss the value of the bond between a father and his newborn child repulses me. This kind of attitude is something I've dealt with for at least the last 2 years at my job.

138,10ztcp7,2023-02-11,MensRights,Is the US DoL making it deliberately difficult to find the 11:1 gender imbalance in workplace fatalities?,"The U.S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS says there were 5,190 Fatal Occupational Injuries in 2021. Are men more affected than women? Let's find out!

1/

Firstly, let's glance at Wikipedia's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational\_fatality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_fatality) page: no gender imbalance is mentioned, that means there is none, right?

2/

Luckily the BoLS provides all it's data in one neat overview page: [https://www.bls.gov/iif/fatal-injuries-tables.htm](https://www.bls.gov/iif/fatal-injuries-tables.htm), and we can easily spot what we are looking for: **Distribution of fatal injury events by gender of worker** ([HTML](https://www.bls.gov/charts/census-of-fatal-occupational-injuries/distribution-fatal-events-by-gender.htm)).

>Roadway incidents Men: 24%  
>  
>Roadway incidents Women: 25%   
>  
>Falls, slips, trips Men: 17%  
>  
>Falls, slips, trips Women:  11%

Hurray, there is essentially no imbalance between men and women workplace fatalities! 

Wait, there is something fishy going on in here. Those percentages add up to 100, the graph does not show **distribution of fatal injury events by gender,** it shows **distribution of fatal injury events by category per each gender.**

3/ 

That's wired. Let's look at race. There is the **Number of fatal work injuries by race or ethnic origin** ([HTML](https://www.bls.gov/charts/census-of-fatal-occupational-injuries/number-of-fatal-work-injuries-by-race-or-ethnic-origin.htm)) page and it shows exactly what you would expect: 

>White: 3,103  
>  
>African American: 653  
>  
>Hispanic: 1,130  
>  
>\[...\]

4/

No other gender categories in the overview page. Maybe searching for ""gender"" will help? Indeed, Google returns data for **Homicides and other workplace assaults by gender in 2019** ([HTML](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2021/homicides-and-other-workplace-assaults-by-gender-in-2019.htm))

>Homicides Men: 7.5%  
>  
>Homicides Women: 20.1%  
>  
>All other fatal incidents Men: 92.5%  
>  
>All other fatal incidents Women: 79.9%

Again, no actual gender comparison, just relative numbers. Is this deliberate? 

5/ 

Finally, this page contains a tidbit of information: **News Release - 2021 data** ([HTML](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.nr0.htm))

A week goes by and then she texts me claiming I had ripped the condom off (which I didn't) and got a rape kit done. I lawyered up, the police contacted me and I didn't say anything. The police ended up not charging me. I thought it was over. But no, she then went to my regulatory profession, I'm a nurse, and they charged me with acting unprofessional and suspended me. This was absurd and I had all my exes write in to say I was a good boyfriend and respecting when it came to sex. They held a kangaroo court hearing and nodded their heads in agreement with everything she said. My profession threw me under the bus and ignored all the evidence to the contrary and branded me guilty of being unprofessional for sexually assaulting this person (and no, she was not a patient) and revoked my licence to work as a nurse. 

This went on the news, and my life has been utterly destroyed. I'm in debt. No one wants to hire me. I cant do the job I love anymore.

Two members of that union, both white men, recently approached me for advice on a situation they'd encountered, because they knew I had been a committee member of some years experience. I immediately told them that I'd left, and why I'd left, and they explained to me that they knew all about it and that's why they'd approached me.

The situation is that we all work in the same industry where self-employed people are often interviewed for jobs of a few days' to a few months' duration. These men met when attending such an interview. Man 1 had been leaving while the other waited in the lobby, and as he passed, Man 1 said to Man 2 that he was wasting his time; the job was only open to women and that any men interviewed were invited only to avoid the appearance of a women-only hiring process. Man 2 went into the interview, asked whether any of this was true, and was told quite unashamedly by the interviewers that it was.

It had been their inclination to complain about this to the union, which would be a reasonable reaction to such a flagrant breach of employment law, not to mention wasting their time preparing for and attending the interview. However, they are both aware that the relevant union subcommittee is heavily influenced by hardline feminists, and  that the union has consistently tolerated flagrant breaches of the union's own rules as well as absolutely illegal behaviour.

As such these guys' concerns are unlikely to be meaningfully acted upon. Not only that, but they both independently raised the likelihood of deliberate attempts to smear their reputation in retaliation makes them cautious about even making the complaint. I couldn't give them much comfort; I suspect they're right.

I know my experience is nothing compared to the literal horror stories that have been posted here but I just felt I needed to get this whole thing off my chest.

So I started thinking about opening an anti-feminism online store some time ago. I hate all these feminist slogan T-shirts that are everywhere nowadays. I wasn't familiar with the screen printing process but I figured I'd use the service of companies which handle that for you. And so I went for it. Boy, I was in for a treat.

After I'd created the shirt designs, I started looking for a screen printing company. I didn't expect there to be so many options to choose from, so I spent some time researching. There were two or three companies that kind of dominated the industry but they charged more than the rest just because they had more bells and whistles. 

This put me off as I couldn't afford to pay for unnecessary stuff. My first choice was a smaller company that I hoped would offer more of a personalized service. So I created my account, uploaded my designs and continued the work on my online store. However, the next day I was notified my designs were apparently in violation of this site's rules and qualified as offensive. I re-read their policy and while I did not agree that my designs [(here's a few examples)](http://imgur.com/a/mRjzb#1) were in any way abusive or offensive, I decided to let it go and use another service. I figured any arguments at that point would be meaningless.

Now here's where the real fun starts. After going through the entire process again - filling out forms, uploading designs etc. - I received a termination email of sorts from the second company too! This time it wasn't even some pre-written template. It was sent to me directly by the owner of the service, basically telling me to go to hell because of my 'ridiculous' views.

A proud 'fefminist'? She must've been so mad that she started mistyping words and stuff, lmao. Acting all outraged by the fact that people are selling men's rights apparel. Because that's reserved for poor oppressed feminists only, right? But who's the oppressed one really? Again, my designs were in no way abusive!

Her condescending tone admittedly pissed me off, though the fact that she came off as an illiterate moron kind of amused me at the same time. It was frustrating mostly because I had to start all over several times but I tried not to get worked up about it and now I'm close to finishing my project with another company.

Everything I thought about feminism was true. It isn't about gender equality at all.

For the record, I have not mentioned any company names because I realize how passionate this community is. I don't want to feel guilty in case any companies/websites receive some sort of backlash due to my comments. Sure, I think they might deserve it to a certain extent but I also don't wish to affect their source of income even if their handling of the situation was questionable.

EDIT: To the guys who think I should post the companies' names: I appreciate your opinion, but it's not happening for the following reasons:

1) I DID submit personal details to both services. Some people have already called me a coward but I've had personal dealings with raving feminists before and I do not wish to go through all the bullshit again. Especially online. I don't have the time and I don't need the drama. If you feel I'm letting you down, sorry.

2) Whatever I've shared here, they will simply deny, so what's the point? It's their word against mine, except that it's also their company.

3) The companies are small enough that I can almost guarantee you won't be unfortunate enough to stumble upon their services unless you were very, very specific. If you're looking to get an online tee business going, don't make the mistakes I made and just go to a major company.

As far as the shirts go: as I mentioned in the original post, I'd considered working with one of the big screen printing companies to finish my store but after reading through the comments and doing some additional research, I'm going with an on demand fulfillment service. It's more convenient and I hope it won't take too long because I'm going on vacation soon. But more importantly, the process is completely automated so I won't have to deal with any more morons online. It costs more but I probably won't make much money either way, so fuck it.

166,15novc8,2023-08-10,MensRights,Lost job due to false claims. My story.,"This is LONG so if you want read it all go for it. If not, extremely short summary at the end. 

I'm a 35M and have worked for this company for 14 years was going into 15th (starred when I was 19).

So I recently lost my job 2 months ago. I though I had handled the situation that I found myself in correctly with a female at work. This situation occurred at a site that wasn't my home site but was the females home site. 

Come to find out 2 days ago after going through mediation in an attempt to get my job back; it was discovered that the reason I thought I got fired for was NOT the reason I got fired for. The female claimed that I made sexual comments, comments about her looks, and grab her. She claimed that the sexual comments and the grab happened at the same time and the comment about her looks was at a different time. What she failed to realize that the time these incidents occurred there were witnesses. 

Now this is where it gets really fucked up. The comments about her looks. I did not say but I was present at the moment. I told the investigative team the name of the person that made the comment but I was accused of protecting that person that made the comment and continually harassed and accused for making the comment. And called a horrible team lead becuase I didn't know what the intent was behind the comment or why the comment needed to be said. Yet remember I wasn't the one who said the comment. 

The grab & sexual comments that she said that I supposedly did was in an area where there's video cameras and also witnesses. 

The investigation team pressued me and continually accused me of doing the grab and comment. The investigation teamed threatened me w/ the ability to pull video footage & audio recordings. I told them to do it woth no hesitation because my home site has a camera ever 6 feet and nothing is missed and I knew 100% I didn't not do what this girl claimed. I even offered to walk the investigation team through everything step by step what had occurred in the work area around the piece of equipment the female claimed the incident took place at as the site I was being question at had the same piece of equipment and same set up, becuase they were having difficulty understanding what occured. I offered it 5 times and was denied every single time. 

For 3 hours I was called a liar & accused of doing what this female claimed. I gave a 4 pg statement (written of course), was suspended, then 2 week later was fired. 

Fast forward 2 months - going the the EDR (employee dispute resolution) process - I get to mediation (which was 2 days ago) because I was denied every step of the process and was left with 2 sets - mediation & arbitration. 

During the mediation I get sent back my own statement that I had written 2 months ago. I am told to read my statement during and as I'm reading my statement, I start getting asked questions. Every time I'm asked a question I respond to back that yhe answer is the next sentence, or the next line down, or the next 2 or 3 lines down. And as I continue reading my statement and I keep getting asked questions. I realized they never read my statement. They took the female's words over mine. When they brought up that they had multiple statements. All they talked about was the female's statement. The only time another statement was brought up was when the comment about her looks were mention but all the other statement said that they heard the comment but no name was given. 

Strike 1.

So then as I continue to read my statement. And I come up to the portion where I thought I did something wrong and corrected is why I was getting fired actually turned out to not be the reason while I was getting fired. This portion was where I was accused to have grabbed her by the hips and made the sexual comments. I asked during the mediation did their investigation team tell them that offered multiple times in the site that they were questioning me at to show them what happened around the piece of equipment the said accusations occurred around. The response was 'no'. Then I asked what is this girl's definition of a 'grabbed'.  They respond to back, they don't know what the girl's definition of a grab was. They just saw grabbed in her statement and assumed it was both hands. 

Strike 2 & 3.

When the camera footage a brought up and they told me the investigation team was going to pull video footage. I followup with what did the footage show they delfected to the comments about her looks and asked me what was the intent behind the comment about her looks and I responded back to them again. I was not the one that made the comment. I don't know the intent behind the comment and you need to talk to the person that I named in my statement & told your investigation team even though they accused me of lying and protecting that person what the intent was. They responded back to me that they did talk to that person and when I asked what was it, they back tracked and said we we have a statement that says it was said.

Strike 4 & 5.

Let's just say the tone went from 'we're never gonna give your job back' to 'we are very flexible'. 

So I decided to not take my job back and have them change my status from terminated to resign and I told them in a very polite &  professional way they can go fuck themselves.  Because in my the last 5 years with the company. I've had dealt with so lies told about me than any other time in the last 15 years total I have worked for them, and there was no guarantee that they would not do this again in the future.

So it was discovered that I was fired wrongfully based off of lies by the female & investigation team.

167,19em9ik,2024-01-24,MensRights,What are your thoughts on paternity leave?,"I’m asking this because once I started my career every place I have worked at has had a generous maternity leave policy, but the paternity leave policy is laughable in comparison if it even exists at all.

For example, if I were to have a kid my current employer offers up to 2 weeks of paternity leave.  Mothers are offered 11 weeks of time off with full pay. 

The measly 2 weeks is better than the job I had when I actually did become a father.  They had a similar generous maternity leave policy, but *zero* paternity leave.  I had to take all of my banked vacation time so I could stay home and take care of my newborn and my partner.  When I got back to the office I was told that my boss had to fight for my job because the CEO wanted to fire me over that. 

As a father I have changed every diaper while I was home, mixed formula and bottle fed, bathed and changed the baby, tended to my partner’s needs while she recovered from the pregnancy.  But apparently a father’s place is away at the office?  If leave is offered at all, it should be a general “Parental Leave”, not maternity or paternity.

So they added it to his name, and not anyone elses. He works in an office where probably 80+% of the Psychologists are women. He did notice they added it only to his, he just said ""whatever"" and moved on. He got a nasty email from one of the women psychologist accusing him of being a ""misogynist"" for having it added to his name, and not the others, which is not what he was lobbying for.

169,168szk1,2023-09-03,MensRights,Unfair Suspension at work,"For legal reasons, I have changed any identifiable names, dates, locations etc. 

I work for a large police force in England as a civilian member of staff. In 2021, I started having an affair with a female colleague. The affair was supposed to be sexual and nothing more, but it grew. Two months into the affair I was promoted to a supervisory position. We will call the person I had an affair with Jess. 

Workplace relationships (including affairs) are very common amongst police forces in England. Working with loved ones on your shift is also not uncommon. Upon my promotion, I was due to be Jess' direct line manager. I declared the nature of our relationship and made adjustments to the team I was managing to ensure I was not her line manager. I was simply a supervisor who worked on the same shift. 

Approximately 5 months into our relationship (now very much into 2022), me and Jess got into an argument and I told her I was no longer interested in a relationship. This led to Jess attempting to throw herself in front of a moving lorry and me having to restrain her to prevent this from happening. The whole incident was recorded as me being a domestic abuse suspect, but no further action required. 

Despite my better judgements, I agreed with Jess to give our relationship another chance. This went well for 4 / 5 months where I found we were arguing a lot, so again I decided to end the relationship. She asked I went to see her in person, so I agreed. When getting to the address she was at, as I knocked on the door, she overdosed on cocaine and passed out in front of me. I had to ""scoop and run"" her up to the nearest A&E due to ambulance delays. I then remained with her for hours until she was discharged home. 

Again, ignoring the warning signs, I decided to agree to return to our relationship for another chance. 2/3 months later we amicably agree we would be better as best friends and proceed as such. 

At this stage, I was severely struggling with my mental health, having made suicide attempts, been a high risk missing person and was regularly inflicting self harm. My managers approach to this was ""just come to work to distract yourself"". I'm now in a place where I could honestly say, I should have been sectioned. 

During one of my breakdowns, Jess decides she no longer wants a friendship as it will lead to more between us. This just toppled me over the edge, and I took some time off work. During the argument, Jess made it clear she was very upset she had no pictures and no memories of our relationship. 

During a brief period off work, I shared a link with her that gave her access to a folder on my phone containing pictures of our memories. Some of these images were indecent images of her. When I shared the link with Jess I told her ""save what you want to keep, I know you said you were upset you didn't have any"" or a text similar to this. 

I feel it is important to note, the argument we got into as friends that led to us no longer being friends was her demanding that I requested I changed shift. She had provided me a deadline, and if I had not changed shift by then, she would ""get me off the shift another way"". 

Fast forward a few weeks, I decide to report the threat that was made. I didn't want to leave my shift. I reported the threat to a colleague of the same rank of me, and a Police Inspector. I was told I would speak to police officers to provide a statement. 

Some days pass (1 week), and no one speaks to me. However, I notice police officers start speaking to Jess regularly. So I challenge this with my line manager who is also a Police Inspector. My Inspector simply stated ""Females are statistically more vulnerable and more likely to be a victim, so we have to prioritise her.""

Unhappy with this, I demand to speak to his line manager, which is a Chief Inspector. To my surprise, the Chief Inspector also stated ""Females are more vulnerable, so we will prioritise her.""

A further couple of days pass, and I am arrested for malicious communications and Coercive and Controlling behaviour. The exact allegation is I threatened to use the indecent images of Jess by sending them to her boyfriend to expose our affair if she ended the relationship with me. 

I feel it is important to note, the criminal investigation which saw all my electronics seized etc. Found NO evidence of any offence in 1 month and a couple of days. 

Once the criminal investigation closed, the police force I work for launched an internal investigation for gross misconduct... yes... despite there being no evidence found. That investigstion is currently in its 7th month, and I still have not been asked to provide my own account. 

The head of the team investigating me is a ""white ribbon ambassador"" - which essentially means they lead by example to end ""Men's violence towards women"". 

Police forces across England at the moment are massively orientated towards penalising men who work for them at the slightest allegation due to media attention for other cases - like PC Wayne Cousins or PC Carrick. 

I feel my rights don't matter simply because I'm male and I'm being offered no help and support. If I raise a grievance, I'm told it won't be investigated until after my misconduct process. I've been instructed thst I cannot obtain my own evidence for my misconduct investigation.

179,wbrk1o,2022-07-30,MensRights,"I find myself disgusted by ""sex work"" and wonder how, in a world it's respected, men by and large can be any more than financial slaves or loners","I feel like every day the amount of girls making Onlyfans and similar going up. Girls who are below typical attractiveness making solid incomes, not even just young women but often well into their 50's, and attractive but not unbelievably so women making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. At the same time, people are having less sex than ever. If you consider going over a year without sex on average to be incel status, about a third of adult men are incels. It's no longer some niche thing that you have to be unusually ugly or unlikable to be. This only drives up the value of even getting the faint illusion of connection to a woman further out of reach, worsens porn addiction. 8 years ago, Tinder would give me about a match every 2 days. Now I'd be lucky to get one a week, and half of what I do get are onlyfans girls advertising. I'm with someone now but the dating landscape is devastatingly bad. Fewer men having success in dating broadens the range of women who can make a living off of having no skills but just having tits and a vagina, and exploiting the desperation and loneliness of this ever growing pool of men, who are simultaneously discriminated against in the workplace and made to consider their own sexuality evil, pressuring them to express it in the most toxic and non self respecting forms, giving up money they've worked for for someone who views them as a utility, not a mutual exchange of like for like, as with a healthy hookup or relationship, not even like a traditional husband wife partnership where the husband is the breadwinner and the wife works hard to take care of home and family, but for resources for essentially nothing but their existence, and a few feeble gestures of fake affection. Sex work is not like normal work. It doesn't produce something we wouldn't otherwise have. It takes something people would normally do for love and fun, something which emotionally bonds and creates joyful shared experiences and encourages it to be removed from it's joyful context withheld for money, 99% one way. Does ANYONE think with less sex work, the world would be a worse place? With women being required to be actually productive to make money instead of lying around and feeding unhealthy addictions brought about by and encouraging the loss of intimacy between the sexes?

I know my opinion is unpopular even in this subreddit, because ""It's consentual selling of services like any other business transaction"" etc. but all I can think of when I see this more and more often is people selling something they did nothing to earn, with minimal required skill, and all the lonely, desperate men who feel locked out of basic joys of life that they're exploiting. Does nobody think maybe the reason it's a taboo and disrespected profession historically is because it's deeply toxic, antisocial and destructive, like, say, gambling? It really repulses me. My question is where are the breaks on this thing? What is to stop this expanding to the significant majority of women exploiting the majority of men, apart from a cultural attitude that it is to be looked down upon, and men refusing to let themselves be taken advantage of? But with men getting lonelier year on year, the desperation must grow stronger and stronger. You can't fix it with law, it will only make the behaviour more covert. There's too many grey areas. We've seen those women who hop from guy to guy, sleeping with him now and again and never paying rent or bills or working until the guy gets tired and she finds a new one, while the guy next door loses a shift at his job and has to sleep on the street. We already know women control the majority of spending, buy houses earlier etc. despite technically, in a reported sense, making less than men. It should be no wonder how.

Women complains that man keeping it professional at work makes her and other female coworkers feel uncomfortable","The other day I was bored and started doomscrolling on Reddit when I found this post on r/relationship_advice 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/10yx39j/a\_colleague\_at\_work\_27m\_of\_1\_year\_refuses\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10yx39j/a_colleague_at_work_27m_of_1_year_refuses_to/)

Essentially the post is about how some dude in the office (27M) won’t speak to OP (24F) and the other women at the office. He won’t talk with them about anything other than work with the girls, but is friends with the guys. However, he is cordial and will exchange some basic pleasantries (have a good day etc). In other words, he is being a normal coworker and OP doesn’t like that.

Now here’s the twist. OP said that one of the girls is considering go to HR about this because she is saying its creating a hostile work environment. This is the part that really pissed me off. Now I acknowledge that maybe the majority of women aren't like this, don't generalize blah blah blah I get it. However, it's not that every woman will, but that any woman can. This is the exact same situation as the google manager in a thread that got posted a while back where the guy got fired for not responding to a female coworker's advances. So the idea that this is an impossible scenario is simply false.

There is simply no winning anymore. Now if you follow the Pence rule, you can be punished for that to.   Act friendly with a woman and ask her out or show interest, and you get punished or fired for harassment. Okay. Men adapt. Now, you act professional with a woman, and her and her friends get upset that this is a hostile work environment and want to report this to HR. If a man does A he gets in trouble. If he does B he gets in trouble. If he reverses course and does Z or Y he gets in trouble as well. If he says f the system it's all BS and goes MGTOW, then he gets labelled incel, misogynist, sexist.

It is promising however that pretty much everyone in the thread called OP out for her total BS, but the simple fact that a group of women would even think to do this is just insane. I suspect (this is just my opinion) that the man is attractive, she showed interest, he says no thanks let's talk about work, and she takes it personally and builds a *hostile work environment* in her mind because she can't fathom that someone doesn't want to be best buddies with her *at work* and just wants to be professional. More attention-seeking bullshit. Nobody is entitled to friendship to anyone, but somehow this is too much to comprehend for some people. Imagine being so fragile that someone not being your best friend makes you feel uncomfortable. It honestly seems to me that she and the other girls at the office are harassing him. Rules for thee but not for me. I shoot you for no reason, but I am the victim.

Imagine if a group of guys went to HR and said, ""we feel upset that a female coworker at the office won't talk with us"". They would be annihilated. This is just complete delusion.

After three years of exemplary performance under the previous ceo they eventually fired me for leaving work 15 minutes early and called it ""job abandonment"" and denied me unemployment and hired a female to replace me. She lasted a few months since she couldn't do the job and they hired another woman I went to school with who was totally incompetent.

Of course there was no reason for me to teach her how to do a job she should have known how to do to get hired in the first place nor could I teach her in a phone conversation what took me years of work and study to learn. They fired me about a week later. 


Incidentally I set up my email to forward to the new ceo before I was removed from the system after asking on my way out if they wanted me to do that as we had with other employees who had quit and they said yes then the new ceo called the police because I was ""harassing her"" with thousands of emails...from a company account I was not in control of that was set up to forward under her instructions. Because of my job I handled dozens of accounts for various platforms and software and got probably 100 emails a day, like analytics reports and such. My favorite part was near the end when her Outlook needed to be fixed she left the calender open on the desktop and it said ""make [myname] f up"" for a day that week.  

Then she trashed my name all over town so nobody would hire me. I tried to be a stay at home dad and my wife and I broke up. Haven't seen my kid in 3 years. Thanks for making the workplace more diverse. I used to be a liberal.",drgk23,t2_s8xnk,0.92,71,24
187,cpeke8,2019-08-12,MensRights,Higher pension ages for men means more men die at work.,"One of the major issues of the MRM is higher pension ages for men- in many countries, the state retirement age is [higher for men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement_age#Retirement_age_by_country), so they must work longer before retiring.

When you analyze this fact, it's actually more than just extra work and less retirement- it actually results in death. We know that men are significantly more likely to work in dangerous jobs, and the workplace mortality rate is much higher for men- men are [10 times more likely](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckdevore/2018/12/19/fatal-employment-men-10-times-more-likely-than-women-to-be-killed-at-work/#3720c15a52e8) to die at work.

So asking men to work longer is asking them to take more of a risk of dying at work. This is especially true when you consider that after the age of 60, that risk would be increased. Consider the difference- a woman working in an office job can retire at 60, a man working in physical labor must work until 65. This is *not* equality.",BlueOrange22,t2_ydooo5,0.96,34,5
188,19ed4wz,2024-01-24,MensRights,Societies financial/success expectations of men IS their version of bodily autonomy.,"I’m very tired of seeing constant talk of how unfair sexual expectations of women that men have and how gross and disrespectful it is.  Yet women’s constant economic/success expectations are just “preferences”.  

Work is what we are doing with our bodies.  Especially with the type of work men do (and whether it is paid OR unpaid, as men do a lot of dangerous and/or dirty jobs in their homes as well).  Women expecting their partners to pay for them, take care of them, or even protect them, is an issue of bodily autonomy.  

Especially in an equal society, with women making more money than ever before, the lack of ability to recognize this aspect of men’s bodily autonomy reeks of male disposability.  Despite that we’re not seeing gender expectations not changing for men by women, and I would argue it’s getting even worse as more and more men are being deemed economically invalid romantic partners with women making more AND wages stagnating.  I think many men could be in a much better place if socially and romantically they weren’t punished so harshly for these struggles and these aspects of their autonomy were recognized.   

I see too often in life where men are rejected because of their financial expectations, exacerbating the societal problems men have, and people writing it off as “incompatibility” via values.   And while I can agree that can happen, in an equal society it mostly just feels more like entitlement to what men’s labor.",StupidSexyQuestions,t2_frdmr7fe,0.88,20,8

Curious to know what feminists think men feel working at jobs that are more likely to kill them and deprive many of them from social contact.,"A contractor friend recently told me this story. He was working on  kitchen in a million plus home, and the wife insisted on being present all day as he and his employee worked. She commented non stop and many times had long conversation on her phone as the men worked. The kids would go about the house coming dangerously close to equipment and the mess that can hurt them. He couldn’t take it anymore. He said nicely please, can they leave him to finish the work and she can review after it was done. She had a melt down, and insisted on talking to his boss. Not satisfied that he was the owner she called the main line number. What she got was the contractors wife who listed patiently about how rude the man talked to her, repeating several times a conversation that lasted about a minute. The contractors wife insisted on speaking to her husband. She told him under no certain terms was he to stay in the house, and that if he didn’t leave the cunt to fix her own mess, she would drag him out of the home herself. She wasn’t having any of it. The contractor tried one last time to ask the lady to leave them to work, when she wouldn’t, they packed up, taking the supplies she hadn’t paid for yet and a job about a third done. 

He also reminds me that in construction one of the most dangerous jobs is roofing. It kills dozens of men annually. It is often done by people with the worst luck in life, and on days with the right barometric pressure they hear the whole world go by them below as if the conversations are in their ears.

191,x9ux8y,2022-09-09,MensRights,"If males in the military have higher physical requirements and get paid the same, that is gender discrimination against equal opportunity. They should be either paid more than females, or require the same physical standards.","Doesn't the slogan ""Equal pay for equal work"" apply here?

If everyone is to be paid the same, tests should be gender neutral. This would also account for genders other than male or female that people would like to be identified.

Physical fitness test should be cater to the job, not the gender. Military is a profession, not a welfare program.

This webpage, although a little outdated, gives a brief outline of the scoring standards for fitness tests of all US military services. ([https://mybaseguide.com/military-fitness-tests/](https://mybaseguide.com/military-fitness-tests/))

The one for the Army is a little outdated. The former test, APFT, was gender discriminatory. The new test, ACFT was initially supposed to be gender neutral. Then they changed it to where the scoring would be gender neutral, but females would get more promotion points for the same score. Then they changed one component of the test, from the leg tuck to the plank, and also made the scoring gender discriminatory. The most recent scoring for the test is ([https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/acft/ACFT\_scoring\_scales\_220323.pdf](https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/acft/ACFT_scoring_scales_220323.pdf)) .

I also hold the view that physical tests should also be AGE neutral. In the case of jobs or ranks that don't require high physical standards, make the physical tests less demanding ( a General doesn't need the same physical fitness as an infantryman/infantrywoman/infantryperson ).

FYI, the intelligence test for the US military is called the ASVAB, and is gender neutral.

For the argument that females bring skills other than physical fitness, if any such skill is important, it should be measured in a gender neutral way.

In case they need females for a specific task, a temporary limited exemption may be made (example: Cultural Support Teams that were useful in Muslim countries).  But a service wide exemption is unfair.

For the argument that females are generally less stronger that males and that should be accounted for: There is no reason to give special exceptions to any category. Why don't we categorize by height then? Why not by eye color, or hair color? What about gender makes it necessary to categorize by that? Also, combat is gender neutral.",jacare_o,t2_14fj8j,0.85,1965,307

Here's the interesting point she brings up.  She works in a primarily male dominated profession, law enforcement.  She's an investigator for the state police in the state we live in, and she's damn good at her job too.  One time while discussing the idea of feminism, she told me this.  

>I work in a very male dominated job, and so do a few of my female co-workers.  I've discussed this idea with them, and none of them are advocates of women's rights like you read on the internet, or hear about radical feminists.  The problem with the women's rights movement is this, most of those radical feminists, are in jobs where they don't really have to deal with real life.  They're in professions like college professors, secretaries, stupid shit like that.

There's no special rules for harassment, because we all harass each other, we all play jokes on each other, we all call each other names, it happens.  The feminists live in a world where they create this pseudo-oppression for themselves, and blame it on men.  Subsequently they feel the need to try and take rights away from men.  Equality for women is already here.  Feminists don't want equality, they want power.

&#x200B;

This LinkedIn study from 2019 used their internal data to examine differences between men and women when job searching. Among the key findings are the fact that men and women view a similar number of jobs though women apply to 20% fewer. A recruiter is 13% more likely to view a man's profile which she described as result of a problematic bias that must be corrected (even though they also found that recruiters will still contact both genders at equal rates).

However, the author (Maria Ignatova) makes no effort to hide her own bias (and sexism) by writing:

>The good news is that when women do apply to a job, they are 16% more likely than men to get hired. In fact, if the role is more senior than their current position, that number goes up to 18%.  
>  
>While this is an uplifting stat, it does show that women do a very thorough job at vetting roles — sometimes maybe too thorough. If women only apply when they feel extremely qualified, this could also indicate they are not pursuing stretch opportunities.

Linkedin is a mainstream website, not a fringe feminist blog. Yet blatant discrimination in hiring practices is celebrated as ""good news"" and as ""uplifting stat(s)"". This doesn't lead to equality, it's just another piece of evidence that equality isn't the actual goal.

Her analysis is also very weak and uses the usual strategy of reframing all issues so that women are the real victims. I think a more plausible hypothesis for why men apply to 20% more jobs is because if we are getting rejected more often then we need to submit more applications to increase our chances of finding work. Of course I would submit fewer if I was getting offers at 16-18% higher rate.

For most of us, this is just seeing statistics that support what we already knew is happening. The worst part is just being gaslit, and told this is ""equality"" and if we have a problem with it we are misogynist or examples of ""toxic masculinity"".

I live on the property of a private boat club, the property is gated, fenced, and has no trespassing signs all over. I live here to keep non-members out of the property as we are located on the water in a large park. 

Tonight I come home from work and do my walk around the property, as I do everyday, and I came across to young women sunbathing on one of the docks. I asked if they were members, they said no, and asked the to politely leave because this is private property. That's when they started to call me a perv, they can do what thay want, on and on. I am a very level headed person and let them rant and I calmly assed them to leave. They called 911 and screaming that some creepy old perv was harassing them. 

After a few minutes the police show up. Two female police. One goes and talks to the girls, the other talks to me. I explain to here that I live here and it is my job as caretaker to keep people from trespassing on the property. All the while the girls are getting all emotional with the other officer using words like creepy, they felt threatened, rape, the whole 9 yards. The 2 officers talk alone, then come over and cuff me risk me, take my wallet, phone, and keys, then seat me in the back of my car while they check my background and a warren search. All the while the two sunbathing girls are all giddy about me being in cuffs and taking my pic and text/posting like crazy. 

After about 15 minutes they take me out of the car and cuffs, and tell me I am free to go. (Go where? I fucking live here!) They then ask the girls, who are pissed that I was uncuffed, if they wanted to file a report against me, but they would have to leave the property. 

So for doing my job, on private property where I live, I end up in handcuffs for being considered ""creepy"" by doing my job. 

The officers never asked me if I wanted to file charges against them for trespassing.....of course. 

Update #1: I woke up this morning and my just venting on here blew up. I've replied to a few comments. I spoke to the board members of the club and we agree that in the future I should just call the non emergency number for the police and to record it. I also contacted a member who is a retired from the state supreme court and she told me ""that is utter bullshit"" as to how I was detained and she is putting a call into the police chief. I appreciate all the support, thank you!

I should hear something in a few weeks. I got the names of of the two girls who were tresspassing. So far I have not found any pics of me cuffed in the back of the car.

So this afternoon was low at work and I called the CPD internal affairs division to find out the status of my complaint against the officers.

Hello R\*\*\*,

I am not happy in your classes. I feel that it is the duty of the instructor to present the material as unbiased as possible, and as a proud feminist you do not do that. These issues are not new, I have been feeling this way for a long time. However, it was on Wednesday of last week that I reached my breaking point. In my twenties I may have identified as a feminist, but I’ve grown since. I do not support the feminist ideology. I believe in equal rights, but “woke feminism” is a joke at best, and very dangerous at its worst. I realize that you are very passionate about your feminist beliefs, but I am not, and I do not want to hear it in the classroom any longer. I have requested several times to transfer to another class however B\*\*\*\*\*n is not responding to my emails. I can no longer sit quietly on this. Until they can find another class for me to join, I will be joining your lectures, but I will do minimal participation. I will not answer questions, and my camera will be off. Topics such as mansplaining, manspreading and the pay gap are non-issues. Mansplaining is a feminist tactic to silence men, manspreading is due to biology, the pay gap is due to the difference choices that men and women make. To pay someone differently for the same job with the same qualifications is illegal and every time they look for it in the West, they repeatedly find men as the underpaid gender, if it exists at all. Just look at what happened with women’s soccer in the US and the BBC in the UK. There is no Patriarchy, just a hierarchy based upon competence, with the most competent rising to the top. And that is just the tip of the iceberg.

Feminism is an ideology based upon victimhood and I will not be a part of that belief system.

It is because I like and respect you that I am writing this email. If it was not for that, I would not have returned.

One last point, men make up 95% of war casualties. The ones that do survive are traumatized, disfigured and never the same. To say that women and children are the biggest victims of war, was deeply offensive. If one considers all people as equals and you can still regard women and children as the biggest victims of war, something is very wrong with your reasoning. Most of those men that died; died protecting our borders so we can be safe and enjoy our lives in peace. Do not discredit their sacrifices. None of them wanted to die, but that was the cost of our freedom.

Sincerely,

Update:

My professor's reply was sent through Bongo. Our classes are all online. I didn't realize that Bongo does not automatically save private messages. The gist of her reply was that she apologized for making me feel uncomfortable in class and she wants to talk with me face to face about my issues with the class. I actually have a good relationship with the professor. I do have the support of all the students in the classroom. The day of the incident where she was particularly man bashing I commented that there was ""too much man hating going on"". The rest of the class either apologized or came to my defense. I really like my classmates. I then went completely silent for the rest of the week and did not join her class.

I'm not worried about her retaliating, there have been so many complaints about her and she is constantly flirting with myself and others. Everything is recorded.

My only hope is that I have seen married men and especially recently married men get a better chance at getting promoted.

I will be switching to a new company in a few months, due to the lack of upward mobility at my current job.  
If I do this, I will go through the entire process, starting with the interview, while wearing a wedding ring.

Thoughts?


**Edit 1:**
In response to the company functions comment, almost all of the men who recently got promoted never show up to any of the company functions.


**Edit 2:**
Some of the comments about the different groups do make sense and I acknowledge the holes in the way I presented my issue.

How about this?
If a married and single man both apply for the same job, which both look the same on paper and have the same performance record; then the married man will get the job in my current company.

Is this a valid statement? 


**Edit  3**
Please, consider this.

When I ask business mentors, friends, ex-bosses, business owners, and other people in my industry I am given the same basic fact:
“A man who is married or has a kid will get more promotions and get bigger bonuses than a single man.  The single man needs to be perfect at his job and work 120% harder than his married co-workers to get ahead.”

Is that not the same exact situation that women faced when they first started to entered the work force in large numbers?

Any time I see anyone who is opposed to porn or other sex work, they are always labelled as a radfem, and I was wondering if there are people who are considered regular, liberal, feminists who are anti-sex work or anti-porn, or if the two don’t overlap?

I wouldn’t consider myself a radfem for example, and disagree with everything they spout except anti-porn things. I also recognise that being a radfem an be a line to becoming less tolerant of other things (like being a TERF, which I am NOT). This may be shaped by my personal experiences and traumas, but the more I research, the more I see damage it does. Another example is that I just don’t understand how people find it empowering to do sex work, when it strikes me as the opposite of empowering.

For a couple of weeks he's been talking about not having a girlfriend, then asking her to be his girlfriend, adding on facebook... Then last week he said to her ""If you don't go out with me I'll smash you with a hammer."" And waved the spoon he was washing so that the foam splashed onto her. After that was when she asked me to come into the cafe.

I've made a point of looking the guy in the eye while I'm there. He hasn't repeated his comments, apparently. I'm very angry about it but she's asked me not to say anything to him directly while she's still working there. 

We're looking for another job for her as this one isn't sufficient hours anyway. I'm planning on reporting it to the Workplace peeps. It will boil down to his word against hers as there's no other witnesses and no other employees willing to make statements, but at the very least they'll contact the place and he'll be made aware that a. there is a system of reporting for people who are harassed and b. it's out of line.

Now that I'm older, I'm more confident and can hold my own, but back then I just stayed quiet.  I thought it would be beneficial to have a panel where women talk about their experiences and share how they dealt with it.


When I proposed the topic to the committee responsible for planning the lunches, they thought it was a great idea but wanted me to broaden the topic to ""challenging"" situations in the workplace, including sexism.  I honestly think that talking about sexism (both overt and subtle) could fill a lunch hour, and I'm struggling to come up with more topics.  Any ideas?

First, let's talk about Hooters.  I've never worked there, but it's my understanding that the way they get around the very problematic policy of hiring only females, only of a certain age, only of a certain weight range, only above a 5 on the hotness scale, and requiring that they dress in a certain sexually provocative way is that they say they aren't hiring servers.  They say they're hiring *models*.  That saves them, I've been told, from lawsuits.

So then there's my classy restaurant, where over in the dining side they wear pants and long aprons and the overwhelming majority of servers (srsly at least 80%) are male, and over in the bar/lounge side they hire only females, only of a certain age, only of a certain weight range, only above a 5 on the hotness scale, and they require that we wear skirts and fishnets.  It's in the handbook listed as our uniform.

We deal with sexual harassment from patrons on the regular and I'm about done with it.  I'd like to go sit down with HR but I'd like to have my ducks in a row before I present.  Do any of you have experience with this topic?  Do you recommend I crosspost anywhere else on reddit?

284,enrr8,2010-12-18,feminisms,How Do I Challenge Gendered Uniform Restrictions at Work?,"So at my job, our appearances are tightly controlled, very different depending on the sex of the employee and reproduce gender binaries in the appearances of the employees.  For instance, males are not allowed to have their hair longer than a certain length (It cannot touch the collar of our shirts), but females are allowed to have long hair if it is pulled back into a ponytail when working.  Also, female employees are allowed to have six ear piercings, three in each ear, but males are only allowed one.  Not one in each ear, but a single piercing in one ear.  However, the company I work for isn't the one who controls the uniform policy.  They work for a larger organization that contracts a number of smaller companies.


Here's how it all works out.  I am an employee for ""Foods and Stuffs,"" which operates the food vendors, and another individual is an employee of ""Games and Things,"" which operates the arcades and games.  We both would work for our respective employers and both of these companies are run by their respective management.  However, both companies work for the overlooking company ""The Fairground."" (Obviously I am using made up names) ""The Fairground"" is the one that establishes the guidelines and uniform restrictions that each individual company is responsible for making their employees follow, and the individual companies have no control over anything appearance wise except the color and logo of their employee's shirts.  Even those are restricted in some ways because no two companies can have employees wear the same color shirts.


My issue is that I do not identify with either gender, but I am sexed as male.  In the past, I have had my hair longer than what would be allowed.  However, at the time I was employed I had cut it short.  Now, I want to grow my hair out again, and although it isn't too long yet, I want it to be much longer and I know that it will be too long for the uniform restrictions.  I have also had my ears pierced before, and although I removed them due to an infection, I was planning on having them pierced again.  I know that I could just get a different job, but I like this job, its my first, and I think the different standards for men and womyn are ridiculous, so I want to change them for future employers who may not fit into this gender binary either.  Like I said, this is my first job and I've never dealt with something like this.  I wanted to know if anyone has attempted to challenge things like this before and could give me any advice on how I might get them changed.


Thank you for any advice you can give, and sorry for the super long post.",firenaux,t2_4i7mn,0.71,3,2

287,mi9hb,2011-11-19,feminisms,Sexist police officers.,"I went to Subway and there were two police officers there going back and forth, in that fun kind of way, where you can tell that they liked each other and were good friends.  I asked them how long they worked together and one of them said ""I don't work with his anymore, he is too difficult"" I said ""Oh that is funny, why is he so difficult?"" and he replied ""Because he keeps sexually harassing women and I keep having to convince them not to file complaints.""  ""and then he goes back and harasses the same girl!""  They both laugh, I guess I smile awkwardly, get my sandwich and booked it out of there.  It was terrible.  One police officer was a predator and the other thought that the story made a funny anecdote. 

Frankly it was intimidating just listening to that story, I can barely imagine how that poor girl felt.

Especially with so many [documented incidents](http://www.myfoxchicago.com/dpp/news/metro/paul-clavijo-juan-vasquez-chicago-police-officers-indicted-sexual-assault-20110602) of [police rape](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/26/us-newyork-rape-police-idUSTRE74P4Z120110526), most of which never get reported, let alone any significant punishment.  

Not to mention how many in the military use their power to rape  people of all genders (I have never met a trans person without a story of some sort of abuse from the police)! 

I hate our system that values perpetrators more than survivors.  How can we demand more accountability from those in power?

I have a friend who is being grossly underpaid. The reasons are historical and intersectional. She's an immigrant who started work on an OJT visa and transitioned to a green card, yet her pay never went up and after two years is just receiving her first review. In that time, she quantifiably saved the company hundreds of thousands of dollars and has taken responsibilities far above and beyond her original job descriptions. Her qualifications and current experience justify a 100% raise, even in this economy.

She was hoping for a fraction of that -- in a profitable company. She was going to go in and listen to her review and just hope for the best. Nobody ever mentioned to her ways to quantify her contributions, traditional arguments and methods of winning raises and promotions (pointing out in a methodical manner examples where she saved the company money above and beyond her peers, productive uses of down time that has allowed her to scale her position, eliminating contractors), and the simple social proof methods, things as simple as bringing in one of the detailed salary.com surveys showing the median price of a worker with her experience, and pointing out domain experience that would be hard to recruit.)

And most importantly, that she wouldn't be fired for trying to negotiate, that the practical worst that would happen would be that she would be given a ""take it or leave it"" proposition, where she would know that she would have time to get another job, particularly since they have nobody else to do functions of her job, and have not been proactive in retaining institutional knowledge (according to her.) 

These aren't guaranteed to do anything. However, without them, the company likely would have tried to give her a glowing review and a modest raise, and she wouldn't know how much more she was worth.

These were techniques that were taught to me by my (men and women) mentors. Her husband is a high earning professional in the same industry, and her father is a successful businessman. Nobody thought to teach her these basic 101 things in negotiating raises, or even that *raises and other benefits can be negotiated!*

We talk about equal pay for equal work, and structural barriers are indeed in force and any ally would be foolish to diminish the effects of the kyriarchy. However, sometimes the information transfer of the soft skills of a profession are neglected, and sometimes a teaspoon from allies is recognizing our privilege of this simple information that we never thought of being transferred...

...and questioning ourselves after the conversation, wondering if her bosses would react to her differently than me as a man? Did my privilege lead me to suggest strategies that are not successful ones due to patriarchal issues I don't know about?",ibsulon,t2_1u44,0.6,3,1

432,188gqo0,2023-12-01,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,When have women ever been the gender more expected to do emotional labor?,"I understand this is an expectation for women. But just because something is an expectation doesn't necessarily mean everybody will live up to it. Or even. Care to live up to it in the first place. After all, women are a human right. And humans aren't perfect angels who can make everybody happy whenever they are in their presence.

They say women have to deal with the burden of dealing with men's emotions. And calling it emotional labor. But I don't think this is 100 percent accurate. And it depends on the person too. Because just based on personal anecdotes, if I had shown any tiny bit of emotion in my house, my Mom and sisters would say I was being too emotional. My Mom even called me the P word once.

Yet I constantly hear how feminists say that women are tasked to deal with emotional labor when it comes to men. When in reality you bring up lonely men on a feminist sub. And all of them would say it's not a woman's job to make men happy. Men should deal with these issues themselves. They are so quick to say that. But yet they feel like women are forced to deal with the emotional labor of men. Even the patriarchy says not says not showing emotions is an issue for men. Women are the first to say trauma dumping whenever a man gets emotional. There is even a trend on TikTok about men getting emotional, it's called the sassy man apocalypse. So where does this exception for women to do emotional labor come from again lol? 

You know what, the same way women feel about men being expected to protect women. Is the same way I feel about women being expected to do emotional labor for men. Meaning I think it's BS. For example, whenever a man says men are expected to protect women in dangerous situations, and a woman gives a snarky/gotcha reply and says ""That's not true, where do you see men protecting women, matter of fact men are more likely to be the ones hurting women"".

I would give this same snarky/gotcha response when it comes to women being expected to do emotional labor for men too. Where do you see women doing emotional labor for men? Matter of fact it's the opposite, society usually ridicules men for showing emotions, (that's something the patriarchy says right). And expect men to either be stoic or angry all the time. And women do make up 50 percent of the population right? So they would play a role in this too.

Like I said in the first paragraph. I'm not denying that this expectation exists for women. But I'm also saying that not everybody will live up to the expectations society has for them. Some people don't even care about living up to these expectations in the first place. Some people are rebels who don't conform to societal norms. And I think people tend to forget that, especially when it comes to gender expectations.

Look I'm not saying it's a bad thing that women are not that focus of the emotional health of men. I agree that it's not a woman's job to make a man happy. But let's be honest here. Are women really doing that job right? Again it's not that I'm mad that ""women are not doing their jobs"". I'm mad that people even think this is a job for women to do in the first place. Since most women don't even care about doing their ""jobs"".

In reality, women are compensated *more* than men for *less* work, and a stronger argument can be made for *men* being the ones who work more for less. 

- women receive more tax benefits despite paying an equal individual tax rate

- women benefit from early pension ages, which men must pay for

- women receive more healthcare funding, despite living longer

- the court system favors women

- the education system favors women, and women receive more scholarships

- employment laws favor women

- there are more social and welfare programs available for women

meanwhile, men must do more work, and for less

- in many countries, men provide free labor via conscription/national service

- in many countries, men have a higher pension age, meaning they work longer to pay for women's early retirement

- men receive less tax benefits and social programs

- men's health receives less funding

- men have less access to public housing and homeless shelters

- men perform unpaid manual and physical labor

- men perform jobs with the highest rate of death

In regards to 'emotional labor', this is an example of feminist doublethink. Feminists present the concept of 'toxic masculinity' an the primary explanation for men's problems. The key facet of toxic masculinity is that men 'cant express themselves'  due to societal pressures and gender roles...well hang on, wouldn't *that* be a form of ingrained emotional labor? And emotional labor with a *gender specific* manifestation that uniquely affects men? If the feminist theory of toxic masculinity is correct, than men face a unique and particular form of emotional labor.

There was an article I read during lockdown how men were more likely to suffer from workplace accidents. It’s shocking yet how come we don’t hear any thing on similar topics like this in the media. Just 4 months ago I fell off a conveyor belt and hit my ribs, truly a painful experience. I wake up everyday and my body hurts, back, joints aches. Who wouldn’t… from lifting heavy things 11 hours straight, so the company can make more profit. I got used to the pain after a while. 

Where is the male privilege the mainstream media narrative claimed. Men have it better, get paid more and have better lives. I became disillusioned of the left on matters that affect men. I used to watch this left-wing streamer(Horse PP fetishist) years ago, I stopped when he tried to refute the statistic where men are more likely to commit suicide. He blamed it on ‘Toxic masculinity’ it’s our fault for not opening up more to our emotions. What he didn’t realise, truly kind and empathetic people are rare. If I opened up to how I feel no one will listen, even your own friends don’t know what to say. 

I’m Incelibate which makes my life even more laughable and pathetic. Most guys like me aren’t even terrible people maybe an minority are. I’ve been around those communities for a long time. The same recurring pattern I’ve noticed is how a lot don’t have a stake in society or purpose. We’re outcasts, weird kids that sat alone during lunch time. We have all kind of issues. Just disposable men, no use for society, or any worth.

I think the social media success bubble goes back to this: Society is seeing how desperate many young men are to cling onto some sort of mentorship, but what I see happening is nothing more than a social engineering feat to make men even more disposable and doubtful of themselves 



Can you imagine all the businesses that would lose their float of men learned how to be more content with what they got, rather than what they have yet **to obtain**?


In other words for young men, it is never enough, you must always be sacrificing and busting your ass for a society that doesn’t reciprocate respect and appreciation in return

But then you realize how many institutions and industries are dependent on this: military industrial complex, construction, manufacturing, energy production, law enforcement, transportation & logistics, EMS, agriculture, basically fields that require sacrificing your all almost

I think society works in a feedback loop in that if young men are always feeling it is never enough, this ignites their inner drive to keep on going at it, even if said workplace doesn’t care for them. So we target them with performance insecurity so that this makes the average man feel even more doubtful and remorseful of himself, is pure mental grooming at its finest


Some say these industries and jobs would collapse big time if men started getting complacent, while I feel this is true to some extent, automation has also taken care of some of that already so don’t give me that BS


Is funny how society literally targets men with performance and work insecurity all the time and men are just expected to comply


Now of course I do think more men should learn to self actualize and transcend that need to always feel validated about everything they do, but of course not every man is going to have enough willpower to go about it like that, that’s why we need to start instead promoting positive motivation for men and watch men’s natural efforts improve",Charming-Necessary85,t2_bz53fr8c,0.96,99,13
437,175cz04,2023-10-11,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Claudia Goldin's work on gender pay gap,"So I wonder what this will mean for the ongoing narrative about the gender pay gap (as in ""poor women are paid less for the same work"").

A quick summary:

The Gender Pay Gap Persists: Goldin's research shows that a gender pay gap exists across various professions and industries, with women typically earning less than men. This gap has narrowed over time but remains a significant issue.

Occupational Segregation: Goldin emphasizes the role of occupational segregation in the pay gap. Women are often concentrated in lower-paying jobs and fields, while men dominate higher-paying ones. This segregation contributes to the earnings disparity.

Human Capital and Career Interruptions: Goldin's work underscores the importance of human capital and career interruptions. Women may experience interruptions in their careers due to family responsibilities, which can affect their earning potential. Investments in education and continuous employment can help reduce this gap.

Wage Penalties for Part-Time Work: Goldin's research highlights that part-time work, often chosen by women for flexibility, tends to have a wage penalty compared to full-time work. This penalty can exacerbate the gender pay gap.

Earnings Premium for Flexibility: Goldin's studies indicate that jobs with greater flexibility can help women mitigate the pay gap. Jobs that allow for work-life balance, such as those with reduced-hour options, often have a wage premium, which can benefit women seeking more balanced lives.

Policy Implications: Goldin's research informs policy discussions about gender pay disparities. She suggests that policies promoting greater work-life balance, such as paid family leave and affordable childcare, can play a significant role in reducing the gender pay gap.

In summary, Claudia Goldin's research emphasizes that the gender pay gap is a multifaceted issue influenced by occupational segregation, career interruptions, and the choices women make regarding work flexibility. Her work provides valuable insights into the persistence of this gap and offers potential policy solutions to address it.

Essentially things that the evil incel-god, Peterson and others are saying, and have been saying since the 70s. So it is not the patriarchy oppressing women, it is a complex issue caused by choices made by women and men. Which may not be an issue, since it is a choice. When you look at it, if someone chooses to cut back on work to be able to devote herself to her family (a notion for which women are *evolved for*), then I do not see the issue, although family friendly policies would benefit men, too, who are in turn, forced to take up the slack, and work harder to make up for the wage-difference. (An aspect that is often forgotten, since feminists do not think of family units, they think of battle of the sexes.)

This book by the Party for Socialism and Liberation presents interesting food for thought for left wing projects which is ultimately tarnished by its own sexism. Here are excerpts from the text:

""The new constitution will mandate that the actions of government agencies be coordinated with mass organizations of labor, women, youth, and other rooted in workplaces, neighborhoods, and schools.""

""...the National People's Assembly will consist of delegates elected from local election districts and from mass organizations representing various sectors in society-- labor unions, women's organization, youth, etc.""

Anyone can infer that men are reduced to mere ""labor,"" no literature degree required. For as much as this book goes on about the exploitation and dehumanization of labor by the capitalist class, its contributors oddly couldn't be bothered to humanize half of humanity. Men are just tools to build the utopia, apparently.

I appreciate their inclusion of youth into the political sphere, but I wonder how much of it is based on a disdain for the small apex of elderly, White men in positions of wealth and power in the US. Intersecting with racial issues, it boggles the mind they suggest a racial minority caste in the legislative branch in this passage:

""To correct this historic injustice and to guarantee the full unity of the working class on the basis of genuine equality, the Assembly of Oppressed Nations will function as a second chamber. It will consist of delegates from oppressed nationalities and peoples.""

The irony of this statement cannot be understated. Nothing would divide the working class more than the proposition of your race giving you the power to veto legislation; this is supposed to replace *the Senate.* It's worth noting that in the National People's Assembly, they think of implementing a quota for half of all delegates to be women. With that in mind, why not just have other quotas for the first assembly instead if you were going to put any in the first place? If resources were evenly distributed in a socialist system, quotas would become unnecessary and more people could enter politics.

In a later chapter discussing the abolition of the medical-industrial complex, the issue of abortion does account for the differences in how it affects women of different classes but does not suggest it's an issue which affects men. In the first section, it neglects how working men were affected by COVID-19 by having to continue working through a pandemic or losing their jobs but highlights the cruelty towards women of having to (checks notes) go ""back into the drudgery of constant cooking, cleaning, and child care."" 

The book touches on the devaluing of care work and reproductive labor since the Industrial Revolution as service work was not as important to capitalist profit, but the authors seem to fall for the narrative as some kind of slight against women. It states such jobs are necessary, but acknowledges working power grids and electrical lines are, and women surely aren't the majority of said occupation. 

Additionally, the entire point of relegating women to the home is because of the interest of reproductive labor in sustaining a workforce to exploit. If anything, these gender roles are more of a coping mechanism under capitalist oppression for working people. The book gives some description as to a better future for reproductive labor but never mentions men's role in it like the author's wouldn't be able to pass biology class.

This sort of neglect extends to discussing things like rights, as you'd imagine. It does interestingly touch on disparity in student loan debt, noting women supposed on average owe $3,000 more on average and Black people owing $13,000 more on average. They don't offer any data on standards of deviation on debt or the factors in what determines said debt. Also, I'm noticing a theme that Black people seem to be the axis of all racial oppression while other groups are only mentioned for things which don't affect Black Americans, like Native American land.

The section describing departments of healthcare is laughable: men don't get one, but women, the elderly, the disabled, and the LGBTQ do. They go on about the patriarchal views dominating healthcare which leads to the neglect of women's health even men are more likely to die of the most common causes. Predictably, the only specific attention males and men get is in reference to transpeople. 

Also, there's a ""healthy"" dose of references to dismantling patriarchal violence and femicide in the current system. They make a vague claim of the amount of households where abusive men hold control over bank accounts and finances even though finances are largely in the hands of women in a given household. They also make a claim of male chauvinism being celebrated, as every guy knows to be false.",TheWorldUnderHell,t2_10xorc,0.85,23,13

""[Emotional labor](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/emotional-labor-in-the-workplace/202004/emotional-labor-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not) is the regulation of one’s feelings at one’s job.""

Except, before anything else, you'll be [berated](https://www.katykatikate.com/the-blog/2019/5/7/so-you-want-to-help-around-the-house) for not being a perfect mind-reading magician and doing so earlier. 

Then comes the fun part: Nothing you do will satisfy her. You'll be scolded and called ""incompetent"" for getting the tiniest of details wrong. You're not good enough, and you never will be. Not unless you read her mind perfectly, because she can't bother explaining things to you; she shouldn't have to.

Any confidence you had in yourself is gone, and you stop doing those things you wanted to; you always get them wrong, anyways. This is the real kicker: Now you'll be blamed for not doing enough. You're now a lazy bum, a manchild, a mama's boy. You depend on her for everything, and she can't take it, so she takes it out on you. ""I don't have to ask you to help! You should know already!"". That's the part that gets you. ""You should know already."" You should already know what she needs help doing. You should already be doing the thing. You should already know exactly how to do the thing, to the last detail. You should already know all that, and the only reason you don't is because you're not good enough.

But oh no, you're not the victim in all this; she is, because she's doing the ""emotional labour"". Stop thinking your feelings are valid; they're just a manifestation of your ""fragile male ego"" that ""needs constant appeasing"". She doesn't need to caress your ego.

440,oup51x,2021-07-30,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,"The feminist challenge to socialist history: why patriarchy theory is both ahistorical, and problematic to leftist class theory","This is an interesting paper about some of the debates in feminism around the history of women and society. It's written from the feminist perspective by a feminist, but in many ways it argues against some of the issues that people in the men's community find troubling with feminism: patriarchy theory, and the post-structural or epistemological approach to history (which is the foundation for much of what we refer to as critical theory or ""wokeism"").

Patriarchy theory is of course the view that men work together to organize or control society to oppress women. And radical feminists have tried for a really long time to establish this as a fundamental pattern throughout all of human history.

The problem is this directly contradicts Marxist class theory, which posits that the ruling class oppresses the working class by extracting surplus value from them.  In particular, the ruling class is made up of both men and women, and the working class is made up of both men and women.  Men as a class do not oppress women as a class. And logically speaking, patriarchy theory and Marxist class theory cannot both be true at the same time.

At the core of the paper is an analysis of gender segregation during the rise of capitalism and industrialization in the UK. Many feminists have tried to make the argument that men saw women as natural enemies in the workplace and sought to pass legislation to limit competition and force women into a more subservient role at home.

There are many factual problems with this interpretation though.  Most notably is the fact that female employment actually increased through most of the industrial revolution, and the fact that men usually enjoyed and preferred the company of women at work.  And when feminists have found evidence of men supposedly flexing their muscles to force women out of the workplace, a more sober analysis usually finds other conclusions.

In particular, most of the cited examples come from the context of worker's rights and the broader socialist movement, where women and children often got the better end of the deal with protective legislation that often excluded men (who were sometimes part of the legislation during earlier drafts but then left out later). While it's true that this did have the effect of pushing some women out of the workforce and into the home, which did establish a kind of ""patriarchal"" division of labor that became stereotypical in middle class families in the 20th century, the author sees this as a natural consequence and outcome of historical trends during this period.  And indeed something of a benefit or trade-off for women, especially in the context of maternity and child birth.  Not some kind of conspiracy among men to establish patriarchal control over capitalism and industrial society.  She also argues that the reintroduction of women as quasi breadwinners in the family unit later in the 20th century came about as a result of a breakdown in market stability inside of capitalism, not from feminist activism.

She refers to this interpretation of history as the materialistic interpretation, which draws heavily from Marxist class theory, and argues that it is overall superior to other feminist interpretations of history.

For example:

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2019.05.011

This has traditionally been interpreted to mean that men and women are inherently different and that sex differences come from biology, not from social conditioning.

I have a different theory though.

**The reason women work different jobs in wealthier nations is because men make enough money to** ***allow*** **women to work easier jobs while still maintaining a decent lifestyle.**

The providership role is strongly enforced pretty much everywhere.  Men are expected to earn enough money to also help pay for women.  In poorer countries though, this usually isn't very practical.  So women in those countries often work just as much as men do to help fill the gap.

This has been used to explain why so many women in India work in STEM, for example.

In wealthier counties, women don't have to work the same difficult, stressful jobs that men work.  So they choose not to.  *Because they can*.

If men had the same choice, they would do the same thing.  But for a man to get married, go on dates, or anything like that, he has to earn enough money to satisfy the requirements that women place on men.

So while women become liberated and freed in wealthier nations, men are still worked to death.

 You can see this in history as well:

https://medium.com/@manumission/marriage-as-economic-slavery-3392fe847bf5

At one point there was a push *by women* via the women's movement to get women out of the workforce completely. This happened during the early 1900s in the West during a period of relative economic prosperity. The percentage of women in the workforce went from more than 40% during the industrial revolution to under 25%. Indicating that women were given ""first dibs"" on the type of economic prosperity that allowed people to work less and still maintain a decent lifestyle.

>We can speculate this was because the extra wealth from industrialization meant it became possible for some people to not work outside the home, *and women got this benefit*.

Today it may not be the case anymore because of affirmative action.

I find it interesting that a speculative hypotesis like that of ""insconscious biases"", despite the fact of being put in discussion by findings like this one, was assumed to be true and used as a justification to adopt hiring policies which I personally find truly and explicitely unfair.

I found this interesting blog post on the topic of gender biases in the context of job hunting. I think it is pertinent to this sub, as it touches on the topic of the unfair advantage men are alleged to benefit from in technical job areas, which is commonly attributed to unconscious biases by the interviewers.

The company [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io) wanted to understand why women are significantly less successful than men in technical interviews on their platform. They devised a system to disguise candidates' voices so that men sounded like women and vice versa.

After collecting a few hundred interviews conducted in this way, they surprisingly found the result unchanged. Women, while presenting themselves as men, continued to be less successful. In fact, slightly higher success rate was found for men disguised as women (altought not statistically significant).

Apparently the cause is female candidates' lower tolerance for rejection. In fact, women are more likely to give up after a few rejections, while men are more persistent.

This is not published research. It's the result of a survey conducted by a company on itself. So it is certainly to be taken with a grain of salt. To be more significant it should be reproduced with a bigger sample and peer-reviewed. Also some tests should be made in order to make sure the voice masking really works.

However, I find it to be an interesting result and one that helps challenging the narrative around ""unconscious bias"" and male unfair advantage, which is commonly accepted as true, at least in the corporate world (I just attended a training at work aimed at educating employees on this very topic).",ArmchairDesease,t2_syqh2xsp,0.97,139,17

Women actively look for men who make more money.  Married men make more money not because the wife is cooking and cleaning which somehow helps them earn more, but because their wives saw that they were on promising career trajectories before marrying them.  The incentive for men is therefore to earn more money to attract a partner:

This study shows that a lack of men will cause women to focus on their careers instead of finding a husband. The effect is weaker for women who are more attractive and therefore have a better chance of finding a high earning husband.  This indicates that ""husband hunting"" comes first and ""career hunting"" comes second, as the obviously less less desirable option:

A man's wealth is directly correlated with how women rate him.  A similar effect the other way around is small to non existent.  Men select for looks and personality.  Women select for looks and money.  Thus putting more pressure on men to earn money compared to women:

A loss of income is the single largest predictive factor for a wife wanting to divorce her husband.  The same is not true the other way around.  **And interestingly, a wife's inability or refusal to ""cook and clean"" does not effect a husband's willingness to divorce her, either.**  Indicating that neither side of this is enforced by men, even indirectly.

I'm not sure if this study goes into this, but my guess is personality issues, things like nagging and harassment, might be the biggest factor for wanting a divorce for husbands:

All of these trends start long before people get married or have kids, so children aren't responsible in those cases.

However, when children do enter the picture, it's women who actively enforce these gender norms. Most men would love to stay home and help take care of the kids, but mothers send a clear message to fathers: *""I'm taking care of the kids, in fact I'm naturally better at it than you, so you need to give up on that and instead go out and earn more money to pay for everything""*.

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/social-stigma-for-unemployed-men-75-of-women-are-unlikely-to-date-them-160378575.html

Whether you think it's on purpose, or the byproduct of biology (ie the fact that women are the ones who get pregnant and breastfeed), this gender role does not appear to be enforced in a top down manner by men or because of some kind of patriarchal conspiracy among men.

It also benefits women more than it does men, which some people might even call a *privilege*.  This effect leads to:

* A better work-life balance,

* higher reported levels of life satisfaction, 

* higher reported levels of happiness, 

* more free time, 

* more time spent at home,

* better health outcomes, 

* lower mortality rates,

* and a longer life.

So if men are responsible for this gender role, it is under misguided pretenses.

The traditional explanation that women have less time for a career because of unpaid labor may play a part, especially as a kind of feedback loop, but this effect exists long before marriage and children enter the picture. The answer to the question of who makes less and should therefore spend more time at home with the children is already decided long before the question gets asked.  In part because married men have already spent most of their lives sacrificing their time, health, and happiness in order to maximize their income to attract a wife.

It's also women who tend to ""decide"" who does what in a relationship after children are born.  In fact there's a plethora of research showing that wives and girlfriends command significantly more power and control in relationships than men do. This isn't meant to point fingers and blame women for anything, it just counters the common narrative that we hear about this (where men are by default the ones blamed), so I figure it's worth mentioning.

So I had a contract with a company that would rent me out to other companies and take half of what those second companies were willing to pay. It sounds horrible - and trust me it is - but it was my only way to get by. But what surprised me more than the modern slavery was the experience of togetherness. In most companies I was sent to I was far from the only one with a contract like that. And while I grew up as a lower middle class boy who did surprisingly really well in my education, I was now working side to side with dropouts, refugees and other people who struggled to get by - for whatever reason. 
And even though these people were so different, we all kind of accepted that we were in the same boat. Class bonded us together in a way. There was a muslim-communist who invited me to a koran reading. A hardcore rightwing neo-nazi that was watched by the gov gave me tips for my contract and shared his cigarettes with his turkish and muslim coworker. I worked in a team of about 15 people with 8 different nationalities. My boss was a turkish muslim. My favourite coworker a jew.

We were so different, but it seemed like such a supportive environment. And I miss it. I'm financially better off now, I quit that job years ago to go to university.

460,d0zxdu,2019-09-07,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Structural differences in professional vs. domestic labor.,"So, what got me thinking about this is the complaints about how ""harder"" domestic labor is vs. professional labor. 

When people go to work (professional labor) their tasks are laid out for them, often explicitly. They know what they need to do and often how much time they have to get those tasks completed. 

By contrast, domestic labor is somewhat akin to a person who works from home or has their own business or is an entrepreneur: the deadline and task list is often set in your own head, rather than on paper and monitored by an authority figure (your boss). 

Self-monitoring and self-creating the structure that helps you self-motivate to complete tasks that you need to complete in the absence of a boss is an additional layer of work. This, I feel, is a bit of blind spot in men who gripe about women complaining about domestic labor. They compare domestic labor to professional labor (and, to be fair, domestic labor is often much easier than professional labor), but they fail to account for the fact that domestic labor involves ""being your own boss,"" and I would argue this is important to take into account. 

Like entrepreneurship, domestic labor requires people to work around the clock. There are no ""work hours,"" unless you set them yourself—and honestly, why would you, when you could be using any set of time that you feel motivated to get the requisite work done? Professional work usually doesn't feature this; you're required to be doing work when you're at your job, but not when you're not. For most people, that's 7-8 hours, depending on your lunch break. For domestic labor, the ""work hours"" are often 24/7, meaning you're expected to be working at any particular time, albeit not *all* the time. 

Then there's the task list. Professional jobs provide you with this. Domestic jobs simply provide you with you ideals/goals to meet, and leave you the task of figuring out how to meet them. Creating a framework of individual tasks for meeting these goals is an additional layer of work, involving an additional skill set. Again, like people who are ""self-employed"" or ""freelancing,"" self-discipline is paramount here in a way that it just isn't in professional jobs. 

So, while professional labor comes with a whole host of issues that domestic labor doesn't (e.g. you can get fired, you don't decide your own salary, you don't get to choose how to do your work all the time, etc), domestic labor has it's own issues, and I would argue that one of those issues is an additional ""self-monitoring"" skill set that requires domestic laborers to put in cognitive effort towards creating a structure that is already created for professional laborers.",mtcapri,t2_3bam8rpq,1.0,4,4
461,ev7q8i,2020-01-28,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Is prostitution sex work or exploitation?,"I've recently been introduced to the concept of a SWERF, and wanted some Leftist opinions on what  the legal status of prostitution should be.

I've never paid for sex, nor have I ever felt compelled to, so I will admit beforehand that I may have an unclear picture of the goings-on in the sex industry. However, in the following hypothetical explanations I am purposely ignoring the factor of pimps in order to focus on the point of sale and thus the overall CONCEPT of prostitution.

&#x200B;

I'm personally of the mindset that prostitution is NOT work, but a crime. It exploits both the ""worker"" and the consumer. I base this opinion on the fundamental assumption that sex in its natural form is both free and mutually beneficial. Paying for sex is like paying someone to be your best friend, which I hope is a relationship that most would be able to identify as egregiously exploitative. I would also like to make it clear here that I have no problem with any two (or three, or four, etc.) consenting adults having sex for any reason or in any way that pleases them. I just don't feel like money should be a part of it.

&#x200B;

My basic argument is that if there ever exists a market for sex, something has gone horribly wrong. It necessarily means that there is a shortage of something that everyone should be able to provide as a condition of simply being alive. Or that there is a perverse over-demand beyond what society can reasonably be expected to provide. In either case, this arrangement needlessly pits one against the other. In an ideal world, everyone would have access to sex. And I feel that world is not a utopian fantasy since people already have sex for free as a matter of course.

&#x200B;

In short, if someone is selling themselves for sex, it means that they are attractive. If someone is buying sex it means that they are not.

I consider two situations:

1. From the perspective of the attractive seller, they are most often exploited by a buyer who has enough money to make the seller do what they would rather not. It is, in effect, non-consensual sex. Or sex slavery in the worst cases. Badmouseproductions gives an adequate description of the argument on this side of the conversation. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIkaguqmLgY&t=576s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIkaguqmLgY&t=576s)
2. From the perspective of the unattractive buyer, they are often exploited by a seller who uses their sexual advantage to extract money from a desperate buyer. It stands to reason that someone would have sex with them without coercion. Why would they charge except to take advantage of their privileged position? This woman sums it up well. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7xLfeTytns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7xLfeTytns).I extend this thinking to pornography as well. A lot of consumers of pornography do so bc they cannot find a mate. Pornography is free and I feel it should stay that way otherwise we'd have a lot of sexually frustrated men with no outlet or a lot of poor men with a less than ideal outlet. Just to clarify.

&#x200B;

Most focus on the first situation, but I feel this is bc it is the most visible side of the story and a usual Feminist/female perspective. Since men most often find themselves in the second of the aforementioned situations, I'll be discussing that bc this is the Male Advocates sub.

One thing I think people like BadMouse overlook is that sex jobs can be among the most lucrative professions in any economic situation. And often sex workers make more than the majority of their customers. I also don't see this as a typical worker vs. capitalist dynamic. Customers don't actually own their prostitutes. In fact, unless it's sexual slavery, prostitutes can sometimes even choose their clientele depending on the market. As a result of buyers having zero ownership, sex workers don't make them any profit either. They actually enjoy pure profit if you consider that they might have had sex anyway without being coerced.

Anyhow, my conclusion based on all of this is that selling sex should be illegal. And that sex should be as cost-free as water or pornography. What are your thoughts?

462,cswbvd,2019-08-20,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Shower thought: Did 4th-wave feminism come from the tech industry?,"(**EDIT**: u/lol1969 brought to my attention [some studies](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/cswbvd/shower_thought_did_4thwave_feminism_come_from_the/exii8nc/) which appear to provide good evidence of sexism against women in video game culture at least, so I am now questioning whether there was more truth in the geek feminists' claims than what I thought. In any case, I never objected to addressing any sexism that may be present; my objection was to the very authoritarian and misandrist ways the feminists were going about it.)

I know some people are sick of talking about feminism, but I was still thinking about [a previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/cpsbrj/internet_culture_and_polarization_when_and_how/) where we discussed where the current culture war came from. A related question is where the current wave of feminism came from, since that seems to be a major cause of the broader political polarization.

In the other thread, there were basically two explanations being put forth, one conspiracist and one chaotic. [The conspiracist explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/cq1e3e/why_was_2011_such_a_turning_point_occupy/ewt4giq/) argued that intersectional feminism was deliberately promoted by intelligence agencies to sabotage Occupy Wall Street, which was divided by the ""[progressive stack](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/cpsbrj/internet_culture_and_polarization_when_and_how/ewt23nj/)"" in late 2011. [The chaotic explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/cpsbrj/internet_culture_and_polarization_when_and_how/ewsqwz3/) argued that fourth-wave feminism began with a brief sexual proposition in an elevator at an atheist convention in *mid*\-2011.

But I wasn't really satisfied with either explanation. The sabotage explanation feels more psychologically satisfying, and it wouldn't surprise me if there is a conspiracy that has taken advantage of the divisions caused by feminists, but it doesn't explain why Elevatorgate predated the start date of the alleged conspiracy. As for the Elevatorgate explanation, I guess I just find it hard to believe all the political polarization of today sprang from such a happenstance and trivial incident!

Then I remembered something: The draconian sexual harassment policies pushed at atheist conferences didn't come out of nowhere. They were based on [a ready-made template](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) from [*Geek Feminism Wiki*](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Geek_Feminism_Wiki). Said wiki was set up in 2008 and mostly written during 2009-2012, showing that feminism's war on nerdy men predates 2011. So I think that fourth-wave feminism may actually stem from this ""geek feminism"".

From perusing the website, it can be seen that [much of the current feminist terminology and rhetoric](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Feminism_101) was already in use there. It also shares the fourth wave's smug dogmatism, saying any disagreement is based in ignorance of ""Feminism 101"". Yet despite its supposed infallibility, its Feminism 101 is not based on any single gospel - it [openly admits](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Geek_Feminism#Feminism) to being ideologically eclectic, drawing on ""strands of [radical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_feminism), [liberal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_feminism), [post-colonial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcolonial_feminism), [intersectional](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Intersectionality), and [transfeminism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfeminism)"". Those strands are academic feminist theories [created in the earlier waves](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/cpsbrj/internet_culture_and_polarization_when_and_how/ewub7i5/), dumbed down and weaponized for online propaganda by the feminist blogosphere. Oh yes, there was already a thriving feminist blogosphere by the late 2000s, of which geek feminism was its most activist wing. So it's unclear when the third wave ended and the fourth wave began.

Judging from the wiki's timelines [here](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_geek_feminism) and [here](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_incidents), geek feminism seems to be a movement that grew gradually during the 2000s, through outrage over various ""incidents"" of supposed ""sexism"", ""sexual harassment"", and ""sexualized environment"" in the tech industry. I have not looked deeply into these incidents to find out whether they are being fairly portrayed, but in many cases the complaint seems to be merely that some guy in the tech industry made a presentation with some sexual jokes in it.

Being something of a nerd myself (albeit only occasionally involved in the nerd culture), for a long time I've wondered why feminists are so hateful toward nerdy men and so obsessed with transforming ""geek culture"". At first I gravitated toward the self-serving explanation that feminists hate nerdy men because we're more likely to call out their bullshit due to our intelligence and disdain for social norms. Then as I became more aware that nerdy men are considered unattractive by women, I realized that might also be a reason why feminists hate us. And these two factors are undoubtedly part of the picture. But even if feminists didn't like nerdy men, why couldn't they just leave us alone to enjoy our interests in science, atheism, science fiction, video games, and the erotica that sometimes overlaps with fandoms?

A more fundamental answer is hiding in plain sight, in *Geek Feminism Wiki*'s definition of ""[geekiness](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Geek_Feminism#Geekiness)"":

>Geek Feminism is about women in a range of geeky cultures/communities/activities including (but not limited to) the [Technology industry](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Technology_industry), [Science Fiction fandom](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Science_Fiction_fandom), etc. (For a list of communities we cover so far, see [Category:Communities](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Category:Communities).)

Notice how the very first thing they list is the tech industry. Now, why would they list the tech industry first? It's far less interesting than science fiction, atheism, video games, and many other things that I'd list if you asked me to describe ""geek culture"". Then I realized: the tech industry is an *industry* in which feminist women want jobs. So perhaps all the other stuff - from *Doctor Who* to *Ghostbusters* \- is just a proxy for the much more shallow materialistic goal that feminists really care about: Getting women high-paying careers in the tech industry without awkward sexual advances from the numerous and unattractive men who also work there.

This, then, is the real reason why fourth-wave feminism has largely consisted of demonizing nerdy men.

This explains why ""geek feminists"" have trashed all the geek subcultures they claim to care about. Geek communities had organically evolved around nerdy men's intellectual interests, creative interests, and yes, to some degree, sexual interests. But despite ""geek feminists"" branding themselves as fellow ""geeks"", their interest in geek communities was never about these geeky interests per se (I'm not saying this about *all* nerdy women or even all nerdy feminists, only whoever drove the agenda of ""geek feminism""). Because real nerds (male and female) actually cared about the interests for their own sake, we failed to comprehend that geek feminists were more interested in the associated dollar signs.

This explains geek feminism's obsession with gender-flipping male sci-fi protagonists even if it means trashing everything interesting about the story - it is intended to inspire girls to go into the high-paying tech industry.

This explains why geek feminism's sexual harassment norms are so draconian - because they see geek subcultures not as social events for extracurricular interests, but as a career path to the high-paying tech industry.

This explains why feminists slanderously accused James Damore of calling women ""inferior"" when he merely argued women may be less interested in technology - because they care more about women's jobs being high-paid than being interesting. They want women to get a piece of the wealth, power, and prestige of the tech industry, regardless of the fact that nerdy men gained that through interest in the subject matter.

It even explains why they called it ""geek feminism"" rather than ""nerd feminism"" - the words have subtly different connotations. ""[Nerd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd)"" is an unflattering descriptor that only a real nerd would apply to themselves, connoting obsessive niche interests and social awkwardness. A ""[geek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek)"" is someone who has leveraged their nerdy interests into a successful career in the tech industry. In hindsight, it is very telling that ""geek feminism"" linguistically aligned itself with the latter archetype.

Of course, we already knew that getting women into the tech industry is one of feminism's stated goals. But if I'm right, that is the *original* and *primary* motivation of fourth-wave feminism. If I'm right, then the ""culture war"" was never really about culture - because to feminists, ""geek culture"" was about economics all along.

In my opinion fourth-wave feminism (and to a lesser extent the previous waves) has caused an untold level of damage to men's free speech, due process rights, sexual opportunities, and mental health, with male nerds on the frontlines - to the point where I often wonder if attacking men is some feminists' primary goal. But more likely, feminists care so little about male suffering that they see it as a mere means to an end. And their real main goal may well be to get women into tech jobs that most women probably don't want anyway.

Finally, note that my explanation does not necessarily rule out an element of [conspiracy to sabotage the left](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/cpsbrj/internet_culture_and_polarization_when_and_how/ewrtvnj/). There is [some evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/cs5u56/for_your_leftie_friends_who_still_think_feminism/) of intelligence agency involvement earlier in the history of feminism. *Geek Feminism Wiki*'s timeline contains a very notable incident intersecting with establishment interests pre-2011: the sexual assault accusations made against Julian Assange in 2010. And the tech industry is closely intertwined with the surveillance state, so it is possible that geek feminism was promoted to distract tech employees from more substantive left-wing ideas. (Of course I am not anti-technology - it's technology that is enabling us to have this very discussion - but I'm wary of the institutions who control that technology.)

Arguably, tech feminism was eerily foreshadowed in [Apple's 1984 ad for its personal computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zfqw8nhUwA). The ad looks absurd today, but was apparently very effective at persuading people that owning a personal computer would prevent computing technology being used to create a surveillance state. The ad begins with a crowd of identical-looking drably-dressed bald workers listening to a televised speech by a male leader preaching about censorship (“The information purification directives have created for the first time in all history a garden of pure ideology where each worker may bloom secure from the pests conveying contradictory thoughts!”). All the workers are male as far as I can tell, unless there are some bald women among them. Suddenly, a brightly-dressed athletic woman, running away from armed policemen, throws a large hammer at the screen, symbolizing Apple's promise that “1984 won’t be like ‘1984’.”

Perhaps it's no coincidence that both feminism and the tech industry have more recently revealed their true colors in favor of information purification to keep out contradictory thoughts.",serpentineeyelash,t2_y1uof,0.95,14,74
463,mwgzja,2021-04-22,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,It bothers me how often men's mental/emotional views are ignored in the discussion of family labor,"Yesterday, I came across [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/mvivat/while_more_and_more_men_are_stepping_up_to_do/?ref=share&ref_source=link) post on r/MensLib entitled: 

 [""While more and more men are stepping up to do their fair share, there’s one thing that remains frustratingly uneven: the mental load.](https://archive.is/mNZU7)""

While I have no problems acknowledging the mental and emotional toll that women might face on the homefront, I think this article was one-sided, making assumptions about what men don't think about without ever really talking to men about how they feel about their role in taking care of an providing in the home.

# The Article 

Here's the author's example of ""uneven mental load""

> The way I usually describe it in my own life is: I can’t make my husband start thinking about summer camp in January, or when we’re running out of refills for the soap dispensers (apparently, [a common gripe!](https://archive.is/o/mNZU7/https://twitter.com/ACShilton/status/1382332736065699848?s=20)). In other words, I can’t export my brain to him. In most aspects of domestic work, we are fairly equal — I probably do more housework and he does more child care, but we feel good about our balance. And yet, the mental load is more on me. 

The article goes on to more neatly define what cognitive/mental load means in this context. 

>She published a paper in [the American Sociological Review](https://archive.is/o/mNZU7/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122419859007) that breaks down the mental load — “cognitive labor,” in sociological terms — into four parts: anticipate, identify, decide, monitor.  
>  
>If we’re using the summer camp example, “anticipate” is realizing we need to start thinking about options for the summer before they fill up; “identify” is looking into the types of camps that will suit our family’s needs; “decide” is choosing the camp; and “monitor” is making sure the kids are signed up and their medical forms are sent in.

While I agree that many of these tasks, especially the anticipate and monitor parts, might have a gender imbalance, I think the definition for ""cognitive load"" reflects motivated reasoning that specifically has a bias in favor of women. I mean, even the author of the original paper and her advisors view the outcome as already decided: 

>One of the things that my advisers were a little bit worried about when I started this project was they thought: **You’re just going to find that women do more of this. How is that interesting? We know that instinctively.**  
>  
>And that’s why I really wanted to break down not just “women do more,” but what exactly is it that they’re doing more of? And are there aspects of it that are more and less gendered?

Motivated reasoning on its own, isn't really the issue here (I'm using some level of motivated reasoning because of my own personal experiences with this subject). The bigger issue is how this erases the mental load that men might face, specifically when it comes to financial/provider responsibilities.

# Men As Providers

[Men, in general, are still seen by vast swathes of the population, as financial providers](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/20/americans-see-men-as-the-financial-providers-even-as-womens-contributions-grow/), despite what some commenters on the thread [might think](https://np.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/mvivat/while_more_and_more_men_are_stepping_up_to_do/gvcovi4/).  

Despite mothers being the bread-winner in nearly 40% of all households, men are still seen as the provider of financial resources more often than women:

> But there are also some differences in the way the public weighs the roles of mothers and fathers, especially when it comes to being an income provider. **Just 25% of survey respondents say this is an extremely important role for mothers, compared with 41% who feel that way about fathers.** 

[(source)](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/20/americans-see-men-as-the-financial-providers-even-as-womens-contributions-grow/)

It's also important to note that most of those mothers are single mothers (even though the share of single mothers in this pool is shrinking):

>These “breadwinner moms” are made up of two very different groups: 5.1 million **(37%) are married mothers** who have a higher income than their husbands, and 8.6 million **(63%) are single mothers.**

[(source)](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2013/05/29/breadwinner-moms/)

Likely because of this social pressure, married fathers work more hours and have less leisure time than their single and cohabiting counterparts:

>Compared with single fathers and fathers who live with a partner, married fathers work the longest hours for pay and enjoy the least amount of leisure time. On average, time-use data show **they worked 39 paid hours per week, seven hours more than cohabiting fathers and five hours more than single fathers. On the other hand, married fathers have less leisure time: 27 hours per week, compared with 33 hours for cohabiting fathers and 31 hours for single fathers.** 

Men in general, hold this aspect of parenting to be what makes them a good father/husband 

> Men are especially likely to place a greater emphasis on their role as financial providers. **While a nearly equal share of men and women say a man needs to be able to provide for his family to be a good husband or partner (72% and 71%, respectively), men are less likely than women to say the same about women.** 

[(source)](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/20/americans-see-men-as-the-financial-providers-even-as-womens-contributions-grow/)

This is also reflected in male suicide rates in which j[ob losses during a recession is a critical determinant of male suicide risks.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25287115/)

# The Mental Load that Men Face

Despite all of that, I think there are a couple stats that illustrate the unfair nature of the definition that was used the original article:

1. **Fathers might not do as much housework or childcare, but when factoring in time for provider-role labor outside the home, the total contribution to the home is about the same (in hours).**
   1. Although fathers have increased their time doing childcare and housework, time-use data show they spend on average half the time that mothers do on these household tasks. However, fathers’ time in paid work is significantly higher than that of mothers (37 hours per week vs. 21 hours per week). **As a result, the total workload for mothers and fathers is almost equal (53 hours and 54 hours, respectively).**
2. **Fathers, like mothers, overwhelmingly feel the brunt of balancing work and family and bear nearly just as much stress as mothers do in striking a work-life balance.** 
   1. According to a Pew Research Center survey, **56% of working moms and 50% of working dads find it very or somewhat difficult to juggle their responsibilities in these two areas**. **Similar shares of fathers (32%) and mothers (37%) say that they always feel rushed**, even to do the things they have to do.
3. **Fathers are more likely to be unhappy with the amount of time they spend with their children**
   1.  Half of fathers say they spend the “right amount” of time with their children, compared with 68% of mothers, according to a Pew Research survey. **Meanwhile, fathers are more likely than mothers to report that they don’t spend enough time with their children (46% vs. 23%).** 

The biggest problem with the definition used in the article is that the scope of cognitive labor as defined in her paper [is limited to common household labor tasks](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122419859007) such as cooking, cleaning, shopping, childcare etc and doesn't dive into some of the financial aspects of running a house, such as filing taxes, paying bills on time, managing their personal work schedule, making sure groceries can be afforded, that health/auto insurance bills are paid, etc.

Traditionally, these are tasks that are typically relegated to the ""breadwinner of the household"" which is still primarily the man. In fact, in my own parent's relationship, my father took care of all those responsibilities and my mother took care of the more domestic responsibilities even though they both worked. 

 I am not able to access [her paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122419859007) in its entirety, but it doesn't seem like any of those aspects are included, ***at all.*** (If anyone is able to, feel free to PM me a link to it or just send it to me, I would like to read it in more detail). In general, it doesn't seem like ***any*** of these questions are asked in the literature from google scholar (though I could've looked more thoroughly) and I think it represents a bias in research to focusing on domestic contributions to a household instead of the equally as important financial contributions, the contributions that men typically provide. 

What's even more disturbing to me is how most of the comments in MensLib completely dismiss this idea out of hand because ""women work too"" and instead focus on the need for better mental communication so men can be more aware of what needs to be done. And while I completely agree that better communication is important (if that is what the household sees as important),  I'm really surprised that no one brought up how this article and concept is vastly one-sided.

But I wouldn't be surprised especially since some people [thought](https://np.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/mvivat/while_more_and_more_men_are_stepping_up_to_do/gvcen7e/) they were reading this post on r/TwoXChromosomes",Old-Compote-9991,t2_98cdlxdx,1.0,177,20

Generally, in progressive contexts it's used against men - stating that men overburden the women in lives with all their emotional labor, expecting those women to support them at the drop of a hat. Anecdotes abound of men spilling their guts and dumping trauma on unsuspecting and unqualified women.




I have always struggled to have a conversation about this, because it's almost entirely the opposite of my own experience. I seem to attract those who lay their problems at my feet and desire emotional support. I'm happy to give it to them most of the time, but yeah - occasionally things get uncomfortable. But the most disadvantaged I've ever felt was in a relationship. It's always felt very clear that my role in a relationship is to make things right, keep the peace, and always offer am empathetic and listening ear. In my brief experience with relationships, I found myself assuming the role of the stoic rock - listening as a mentally unwell woman described to me exactly why she didn't want to keep living in this world.



My story is anecdotal, but most of the men I've been able to speak with on this have confirmed it happens often in their life as well. Others dump problems onto them and they are expected to keep moving forward, push harder, and have all the answers.



It just makes me feel like the conversation surrounding emotional labor is very one-sided. Sure, I can get behind the idea that men overall may treat the women in their lives in some secretarial fashion by offloading the demands of a busy life on to them, or by making them the target of inappropriate emotional dumps. But it's very well codified in social roles that men are to be protectors and providers, and that's a very active role as far as emotional expectations are concerned. I don't see why things are only talked about in one direction, so I thought I might ask - who is doing the emotional labor in your relationships? Do you feel like it's been equally distributed?

Hunter-gatherers were not only more egalitarian, but the men in the tribes were definitely helped to be looked after when they were at their most vulnerable and prone to threats or danger


It seems then after the establishment of industrial society we started counting on men just a little too much, this is also when the life expectancy gap between men and women starts to widen(and the gaps only continues to get worse because male disposability is so baked into our system)

I always say that men may have always been biologically disposable, but men didn't start to become more socially/economically disposable until the industrial revolution, this is when we started grooming our men with virtues such as stoicism, hyper-self reliance, overdescipline, radical responsibility and not asking anyone for help


It's gonna be interesting how automation will challenge this dynamic altogether 



There is no logical, holistic reason that I could think of for this other than that society is still dependent on the providing of male labor for the sake of maintaining the civilizational grid/infrastructure

Without going into the debate of whether quotas are a proper answer to workplace inequality (which I personally don't agree but that's another topic entirely) I personally think that demanding more female garbage cleaners/miners/etc. entirely misses the point by attempting to tackle the effect of the issue rather than the cause.

Let's assume for a moment such quotas existed and that after hiring X male garbage cleaners only female ones could be hired. The result would likely be the role being severely understaff due to not enough women applying, just as they don't currently. Instead of stating that ""men work unpleasant/dangerous jobs"" we should take a look at why this happens.

&#x200B;

**The main issue here is not men working undesirable/dangerous jobs, it's men not being hired to safer/more pleasant jobs.** If you have a degree, a good curriculum and work a qualified job you'll be good regardless of gender. However when it comes to unqualified jobs the gap widens a lot. This is due to jobs that involve dealing with people often preferring women or even not hiring men entirely. This is due to the [general view that men are dangerous/predators/violent](https://areomagazine.com/2017/10/17/androphobia-and-how-to-address-it/comment-page-1/#comment-44190) that results in the customer feeling automatically safer and more at ease with a woman (and the employer hiring one).

Me and my friends all had experiences with this. My experiences include being rejected from a pub in Norway where workers earn about 2000€+2000€ more in tips because ""we only hire women"" (they didn't shy away from declaring it) or not being able to land a job in a hostel/hotel due to ""lack of previous experience"" while my female friends got hired to high-end hotels despite no previous experience or academic background in tourism. My friends' experiences included most clothing stores in Portugal not hiring male workers, again including cases of them just straight up declaring it.

If any sort of legislation/quotas would create workplace equality that's not focused solely on the upper classes, it wouldn't be achieved by demanding more women in dangerous/unpleasant jobs. It would be achieved by demanding more men being hired into hotels, hostels, pubs, clothing stores, etc. - not only this would solve the problem of so many men working horrible or dangerous jobs (because men would have an alternative), it would also create equality in fields that are currently almost entirely male, since the amount of people that don't have a choice but to take those wouldn't be so overwhelmingly male but more equally distributed.

468,f7mah4,2020-02-22,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Where will men be when automation removes most of their jobs?,"While I am only moderate left wing (I support social capitalism where the more you earn the more tax you pay which goes into safety nets for the poorest and sickest), I can't see how capitalism is going to continue to function 25+ years from now. This is not like the industrial revolution where humans simply shift from hard labour to service and more advanced fields, there is a limit on how far this will go before we simply run out of jobs. AI and automated labour is getting extremely prevalent. In the next decade, we may lose most or all of our driving jobs, taxis, uber, truckers. Mining is automated. Self serve checkouts becoming more standard in not just supermarkets but restaurants (this is actually inferior to human services but businesses will do it as long as people will put up with it, which they do), AI is being used in place of business planning, factory work is on the way out etc.

Eventually, when there is say 1 job for 2 jobseekers, I see no solution that doesn't involve mass public welfare, be it UBI or some more selective system. With so many people seeking work, companies will have all the power to basically blackmail the lower class into essentially slave labour, working insane hours for barely enough to scrape by in terrible conditions. With so many seeking work, they will take anything, and it will be a race to the bottom. Those with the capital to automate will control everything.

This will be terrible for most average people, but especially bad to men. Our value is still based largely on our success and ability to provide. Young women now earn more than young men yet men are still expected to pay for things, and hypergamy in seeking partners is as strong as it's ever been. Furthermore, women occupy more work areas that involve human service, areas much less at risk than mechanical labour that is male dominated. For women, a career is a nice luxury. For men it defines us, and our value. A life without work is not just a life of poverty, but of loneliness, celibacy, desperation, isolation, and no hope of a family. People mock incels but do they realize the socially, technologically and economically dangerous factors that are making the numbers of lonely, disenfranchized men grow alarmingly fast? An economic safety net in this future seems vital but I think women have less reason to be afraid. A helping hand has always been granted to them in need and many can easily find a partner or several to provide for them, plus the feminist agenda is so powerful the only time companies seem to act against a prfit interest i affirmative action, more women working, so there's an easy way in there. It's going to get much worse if we don't examine how society approaches money, work and gender expectations.

Maybe I'm being a bit alarmist and melodramatic but I am confident there is some truth to these concerns. What do you think? What is the solution?",Dunkolunko,t2_539k9mrk,0.94,15,8
469,qc74xh,2021-10-20,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Can sex work be exploitative of men?,"I apologize in advance if this topic veers too near some sensitive and highly debated topics, but I've been seeing some weird things about this lately and would like to discuss it. 



I think we can all agree that in the last five years or so there's been a massive attitude-change towards sex work (or at least, the rumblings of one). With massive content-creator platforms like OnlyFans and Patreon, the business has been more accessible than ever and many people who hadn't considered it a source of income paused to give it some thought.




I also think we can agree that in many cases, sex work can be exploitative of women who engage in it. This is pretty clearly due to economic pressures, threat or actualization of violence, varying degrees of law enforcement, as well as cultural attitudes towards sex workers.




It seems to me that we live in a day and age where the consumers of sex work are shamed for their actions (at best) and told they directly cause this exploitation (at worst). But specifically in heterosexual markets, there's an attitude that no matter the state of the consumer, they cannot be exploited because they are the individual purchasing this content.



I've seen a lot of sex worker profiles on Twitter and some of the interactions with them terrify me. There are men there that appear completely obsessed and nearly too far gone to help. I witnessed one streamer subtly bragging on how much one man had spent on her stream and it was about $800 over the course of five minutes. I understand money is plentiful in the world, but it feels like those who truly have money to burn aren't looking on Twitch for their erotic content. 



On one hand I feel like this anti-exploitation makes sense - it's largely men demanding this content, and it's generally their money to spend. Who cares if they spend a lot or a little, they chose this and it's their right to do so. No one is going to feel sympathy for them if they regret their actions because they should have known better.



On the other hand, it feels like this ignores viewing addiction as a disease. That example above isn't isolated - I've heard of streamers making *thousands* from individuals and in some cases *demanding* additional payment as ""tribute"". It's always saddened me a little bit because I'm a kink-aware person and I'm fine with degradation-for-money transactions morally, but too many people in the industry seem to wear a facade that their clientele is in good mental health 100% of the time.



I feel like it approaches gambling or alcohol in terms of potential exploitation. I don't think sex workers themselves (in general terms) exploit their clientele, but it should also be understood that someone could (or should) be cut off and directed towards potential resources if they seem as if they might be struggling with addiction. I feel like progressive folks would have little issue saying a casino has a moral and ethical obligation to direct potential addicts towards help, but that seems to go out the window with sex work and it's frustrating.




I feel like this is rarely discussed because the male side of it always gets entrenched in ""they deserve whatever comes to them"" and no space is given for those people for whom this may be a struggle.",pandemisexu4l,t2_83oumoj1,0.97,131,55
470,19dywfb,2024-01-23,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Societies financial/success expectations of men IS their version of bodily autonomy.,"I’m very tired of seeing constant talk of how unfair sexual expectations of women that men have and how gross and disrespectful it is.  Yet women’s constant economic/success expectations are just “preferences”.  

Work is what we are doing with our bodies.  Especially with the type of work men do (and whether it is paid OR unpaid, as men do a lot of dangerous and/or dirty jobs in their homes as well).  Women expecting their partners to pay for them, take care of them, or even protect them, is an issue of bodily autonomy.  

Especially in an equal society, with women making more money than ever before, the lack of ability to recognize this aspect of men’s bodily autonomy reeks of male disposability.  Despite that we’re not seeing gender expectations not changing for men by women, and I would argue it’s getting even worse as more and more men are being deemed economically invalid romantic partners with women making more AND wages stagnating.  I think many men could be in a much better place if socially and romantically they weren’t punished so harshly for these struggles and these aspects of their autonomy were recognized.   

I see too often in life where men are rejected because of their financial expectations, exacerbating the societal problems men have, and people writing it off as “incompatibility” via values.   And while I can agree that can happen, in an equal society it mostly just feels more like entitlement to what men’s labor.  ",StupidSexyQuestions,t2_frdmr7fe,0.98,97,20
471,zz357d,2022-12-30,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Understanding men: The importance of work,"One issue I see in society is people just don't seem to understand men.  Meaning why men behave the way they do and what their motivation are.

This is true not just for women but for many men as well.

One example of this is the importance of work.  While work is important for just about everyone under capitalism, the pressures that we place on men are a lot higher than what we place on women. Men don't have outs and options in life to be taken care of if they don't earn a living for themselves.  So employment often becomes a matter of life and death.

Another reason that work is important is because men derive value from work.  Society judges a man by his earnings capability.  It's not enough to have a good personality or a sense of humor. Nor is it enough to work a job (or to volunteer your time for something) that is meaningful or impactful: men are expected not just to work, but to earn money. This is because we do not place as much default value on a man as we do a woman.

A third reason work is important for men is because work is the avenue that men achieve dating and familiar success.  Men don't just have to work to earn an income for themselves.  They have to earn a surplus for other people.  Men are the ones who pay for dates.  And when children and marriage are on the table, men are the ones who finance all of the major costs in life for a family.

A lot of people just don't seem to understand the financial stress that men are placed under to pay a mortgage and to also come up with enough extra money to keep their wife / girlfriend and kids happy. Men also don't have the freedom to walk away when this arrangement stops working for them. This is enforced both socially and institutionally through the family court system.  In many ways, we turn men into indentured servants.

Many men suffer in silence, doing what is expected of them, because they can't articulate this burden.  Society doesn't give us the language, or even the platform, to begin to talk about this.  So people just don't know.  And then we wonder why men work themselves to death or aren't around for their families.  Even when they work the hours they do *for their families*.

And men do literally work themselves to death.  The male life expectancy is five years lower than women. Men also carry a greater health and disability burden.  Both of which are directly caused by this unspoken problem in society.",Oncefa2,t2_15it3r,0.97,114,32

This particular topic is one that always irks me a little bit because it feels so desperate to be a one-sided issue. It's almost always marketed in a black and white ""women are doing emotional labor, men are not"" way.


And time after time I feel alienated because... I've been on the other side of the supposed ""coin"" regarding emotional labor.



I'm a single guy. If we're defining emotional labor in terms of keeping track of housework, dishes, food, groceries, appointments, calls to family, etc., then I'm doing all of it. My continued existence as an adult shows that I'm perfectly capable shouldering a lot of ""emotional labor"".



If we're defining ""emotional labor"" in terms of some level of emotional suppression and making sure you show the ""right"" emotions, I've again done my fair share of this. In a past relationship I had to be someone's emotional rock - I literally shouldered the emotions of someone suicidal and had to shove my own feelings to the side continuously for their sake.


So, sorry. But I'm sick of being told ""I just don't get it"" in conversations about emotional labor. I DO get it, and I'm not about to argue that men don't do emotional labor and women do. If we want to talk about aggregates and disproportionate effects, let's do that. I desperately wish I could do that instead of seeing articles again and again spin things like men never deal with emotionally intensive tasks.

#Section 2: Life, Death, and Safety
#Chapter 7: Worker safety

#**Overview** Men are quite a bit more likely than women to get injured at work, and they're overwhelmingly more likely to die at work.

Examples/evidence: In the United Kingdom in 2010/11, the rate of major injuries was almost twice as high for men as it was for women (130.5 compared to 68.8 per 100,000 workers) [1]. The difference in workplace deaths is even more stark. A study of workplace deaths in Canada from 1993 to 2005 found that the number of male deaths in 2005 alone was more than double the total number female deaths in the whole 22 year period from 1993 to 2005 [2]. In the United States in 2016, men were 93% of workplace deaths [3].

Note: Things that aren't rights-related are going to be talking about averages and majorities and general expectations, not absolutes.

-----------------------

Reproductive rights:

Routine infant/minor circumcision is routine permanently damaging assault on our baby boys and should be **banned** for being done on minors.

Circumcision is lacking in informed consent for adults who choose to get it.

Men are forced into parenthood financially or otherwise, and they should be allowed some method to prevent. \*Expanded abortion rights for women need to come with this. Other changes are preferably made too. [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/p52r79/providing_for_children_increasing_equality_and/)

Testosterone and other related male hormones, as a Schedule III drug are understudied for use as a contraceptive method.

Men are severely lacking in birth control options compared to women. Men just have condoms, cervical caps, spermicide (which women also have--either can demand such usage at sex), and vasectomy. Compared to women who have the pill, plan b, IUD, implants, shots, patches, tube tying, abortion, and fertility measurements.

Raped men, even children, are still forced into parenthood.

Parental alienation.

----------

Healthcare:

See many of the above.

The life-expectancy gap is multi-faceted and healthcare is partially to blame when we have more research of women's health issues done and more women's health groups.

------------

War:

It's by and large men fighting in and dying in this wars.

Civilians targeted are mostly men.

Men are often forced to stay and fight in their countries, such as in Ukraine right now.

Men are less accepted as refugees. For example in Afghanistan most refugees who got to leave are women.

Conscription (except in Israel) is mandatory military service which only effects men.

------------

Work:

Poor safety standards and regulations cause mostly male deaths.

Men have riskier jobs, less comfortable jobs, less flexible jobs, work more hours, and further commute to jobs. (This leads to them getting paid more.)

Nowadays, it's a negative to be a man in many industries and careers for career growth and getting your foot in the door.

-------------------

Mental Health:

90% of men who committed suicide sought help.

Large amount of male suicides in every country.

-----------------

Social:

Demonization of men, especially darker men. As violent, as sexual predators, as more.

Aversion to stranger men.

Lack of empathy.

Around children for work or fun, sometimes even as a parent --> pedo rapist.

Hyperagency

-----------------------

Social, Sexual/Romantic:

Lack of sexualization of regular men.

Have to initiate - leaves awkward, inept, autistic, etc., men out.

Have to walk on eggshells or risk social damage. This leaves careful and overly-respectful men out.

Have to provide/make more money.

Seen with no inherent worth as a human - always have to ""work on yourself"". It's always your fault.

Various negative assumptions made if long-term single.

Virgin shaming.

----------------

LGBT:

Most hate crimes effect gay men.

Gay men are much less accepted than lesbian women.

Bi-erasure.

Bi men are seen as dirty by women.

Infantilization of trans-men.

-----------------

Criminal system:

Police violence.

Sentencing.

Convictions.

War on drugs.

Prison conditions.

------

Education:

Men get worse grades for the same work.

Women have all sorts of extra scholarships afforded to them.

--------

Other/unorganized:

Older pension age.

Homelessness.",austin101123,t2_8xuqv,0.95,48,23

What the heck is this about? We know that. Well, if we believe that in every other capacity men and women are similarly able, then this would lead to men making more money. More men than women can earn more by use of physical labor. Mining, construction, carpentry, logging, and many other professions are male dominated due to the physical intensity of the work. Without this strength, many of these men would be in lower paying professions that similar otherwise women would be in. This boosts mens earning potential. Similarly, men may be able to work more hours in physically demanding jobs which can lead to more earnings.

--------

**MEN NEED TO EARN MORE**

Men consume roughly 33% more calories in a day [source](https://fitfolk.com/average-calories-burned-per-day-men-women/#bell), despite women being fatter than men.\* I argue then, it is natural that men are capable of generating more value/earning money. They have greater food requirements, and greater requirements due to size in other things too. Such as in general needing bigger furniture to be as comfy, more likely to need a more expensive airplane seat, etc. Even in an evolutionary or prehistorical sense, men being able to provide more would be very necessary due to the greater size and therefore. Basically, this is why they need to use their strength to earn more money. It is less relevant now than it was prehistorically or even historically, but I think it's still important to mention.

\*Bit of a side mention on the women being fatter than men, rather than including it in the main argument:[40% vs 28% bodyfat% average, when health dictates they'd only have 4-7% higher bf% levels, though both men and women should be lower and are both on average obese.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3837418/) (I bring this up, as the discrepancy would be even higher if both men and women were on average healthy.)

This isn't exactly the best source and I can't find a better one right now, but typically women are as healthy as men are at 4-7% higher bodyfat%. This has been true basically everywhere I've seen in the past. Here's a [source](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/body-fat-percentage-chart#chart).

On a side note, BMI is BAD if you are trying to look at aggregate info (BMI isn't very good to use personally either, because of its inaccuracies.), it's used as an estimate for things because it's easier to calculate than bodyfat%. BMI will underestimate how fat people are in aggregate, and especially so for women. Even by BMI which more significantly underrates the overweightness of women, internationally women are fatter.",austin101123,t2_8xuqv,0.59,6,33

Now I do understand the empathy gap and that it's way easier to get support if you talk about women having it bad. I also understand focusing on women's issues as a campaign.

The article comes with lot of interesting information, like:

>According to a [2012 Brookings Institution study](https://www.brookings.edu/research/starting-school-at-a-disadvantage-the-school-readiness-of-poor-children/) by Julia Isaacs, for instance, American girls are 14 percentage points more likely than boys to be “school ready” at age 5, controlling for parental characteristics. **That’s a bigger gap than the one between rich and poor children, or Black and white children, or those who attend preschool and those who do not.** The gap is mostly driven by social and emotional factors, or what social scientists label “noncognitive skills,” rather than academic ones.

While article fails to mention the systemic discrimination of boys by teachers, it at least acknowledges the feminisation of the teacher profession and how the focus on narrow academics [rather than vocational learning](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholaswyman/2015/09/01/why-we-desperately-need-to-bring-back-vocational-training-in-schools/?sh=ae0013587add) puts many boys at a disadvantage.

I know it would be easy to argue that education system should change to accommodate boy's specific needs, but let's be honest, it is not going to happen any time soon. Plus there is also the **class** dimension:

and

>Affluent parents and elite schools are tackling the issue by giving boys more time. But in fact it is boys from poorer backgrounds who struggle the most in the classroom, and these boys, who could benefit most from the gift of time, are the ones least likely to receive it. Public schools usually follow an industrial model, enrolling children automatically based on their birth date. Administrators in the public system rarely have the luxury of conversations with parents about school readiness.

Note this part, where the author apologises for addressing a male issue, when female issues exist too. I suppose he had to do it if he wanted his article to be printed in mainstream media. How sad. 

>A proposal to give a boost to boys may sound odd to some, given the inequities that many girls and women still face. But I am betting on our ability to think two thoughts at once. There is much still to be done to promote female representation in politics and corporate leadership, for example. But as to education, boys and men are the ones who need the most help. And it’s not an issue only for them. When schools fail boys, those boys grow into men lacking the skills to flourish in the workplace, to be strong partners, or to be good providers for their children. Giving boys the gift of time will help create a better society not just for men, but for women and children too.

487,pc5vq1,2021-08-26,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,"""Women presumed to be socially/economically disadvantaged"" - proposed infrastructure Bill in U.S discriminates against men","So this post is simply a preview, I'm going to write an entire article on this issue at a later date.

But I have read [all 2702 pages of the proposed 2021 Infrastructure bill in the US](https://www.manchin.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/bipartisan_infrastructure_bill_text.pdf?cb), and as expected, it has numerous discriminations against men. As I said this post will just a be a preview, and not a fully extensive expose. So let's just get a first look.

I've linked the direct bill in it's entirety. I suggest using clt+f and searching ""women""; doing this, [you should get 37 results,](https://imgur.com/a/Pc9ywoV) meaning 37 instances of the word 'women' appearing. 

I'll start with the most important paragraph for this particular topic- [the US government is still assuming, by law, that women will be ""presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged""](https://imgur.com/a/9PP6ryH). 

To quote:

>except that women shall be presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged individuals for purposes of
this subsection

So, there it is- this economic bill will follow the presumption that women are economically disadvantaged, and as you'll see, this affects the language of the bill, and is used to justify the discrimination of men

Keep in mind that today, it's *men* who are economically behind, especially the younger generation of job seekers:

[Why are young, educated mes working less?](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2018/02/23/why-are-young-educated-men-working-less/)

[Too many young American men aren't working](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-14/too-many-young-american-men-still-aren-t-working)

In the US, men have been behind in education and employment for years now.

So let's looks at a couple of specific examples in this bill where men will be discriminated against:

1. Small Business

2. The trucking industry.

------------------

**Small Business**

[It seems female small business owners will be favored](https://imgur.com/a/wZe2cBZ)

>ANNUAL LISTING OF DISADVANTAGED BUSI11 NESS ENTERPRISES.—Each State shall annually—survey and compile a list of the small business concerns referred to in paragraph (3)
in the State, including the location of the small business concerns in the State; and notify the Secretary, in writing, of the percentage of the small business concerns that are controlled by—
women;

>20 (ii) socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (other than women); and

>23 (iii) individuals who are women and are otherwise socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.

It's not hard to guess how this is going to manifest- male small business owners will face extra difficult and hurdles to getting government assistance. 



-----------------------

**Truck Drivers**

One specific industry under focus is trucking transport. It seems the bill calls for [special efforts to hire more female truck drivers](https://imgur.com/a/TJGMjeJ)

>SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING WOMEN IN
 TRUCKING.—It is the sense of Congress that the trucking industry should explore every opportunity to encourage and support the pursuit and retention of careers in trucking by women, including through programs that support recruitment, driver training, and mentorship.

But this follows the point made above, men have higher rates of unemployment and are disadvantaged in many fields, which is why industries such as trucking are one of the reliable fields men can turn to. Will there be any provision to find men work elsewhere? Is there any provision to support more male workers in female dominated industries?",Vista_Seagrape,t2_ba52yyj1,0.98,182,81

Here's a lengthy blog post that I came across years ago and read again. After the author describes the problems that men can potentially face in the US, Canada, Australia, and numerous European countries, he presents his thesis that misandry is a house of cards in which a number of factors must remain present (like an abundance of money from taxpayers, men's interest in marriage remaining above a critical level, and a very high proportion of men blindly going along with the status quo without realizing what is happening) and that if these factors start weakening, so will this misandry bubble.

What are your thoughts on this? Here are mine. And what do you think needs to be done or needs to happen for this misandry bubble to deflate?

* I really hope this author's theory is true. I would love the idea of defeating this man-hating that seems to have been in vogue simply by refusing to participate (like not marrying a woman, which isn't difficult for me because I'm gay). 
* Maybe I'm optimistic, but I think I'm seeing some signs that people are waking up. I'm seeing a lot more people who aren't buying into this whole unquestionable superiority of women bullshit (at least much more so than in 2011-2012). And these are regular people I know in real life who don't usually think about these things. There are still some posts on Facebook I see that are openly sexist toward men, but I do see a lot more people calling it out now. And there's the fact that the proportion of men interested in marriage in the US has decreased quite a lot in recent decades. And there's that ""herbivore"" movement happening in Japan.
* We might be in the very early stages of this house of cards coming undone. Australia has reduced its financial assistance for gender studies programs substantially, for example. However, I'm still not sure what exactly will happen, or if the misandry bubble will deflate. I'm not sure if there is a country in which it has happened yet; until there is, I wait with cautious optimism.
* The author's timeline was definitely optimistic. Maybe there will be more progress in the coming decade, but I wouldn't be surprised if a significant undoing of the misandry bubble doesn't happen until 2040 or beyond.",EpsilonFactor633,t2_78z6lwac,0.91,15,14

Everyone is calling me an asshole, selfish, a brat, a misogynist, and entitled. So duck em, maybe I am.

Here’s the story 

I’m 15, my sisters are 33 and 24, with a 35 year old husband, her mom, and my parents. We rented. the “side house”, it’s not really a full house and doesn’t have a proper kitchen so we have to use theres. We’re not guests, we pay.

I’m forced to do chores all day. My parents rent space from my sisters family. So we actually PAY to be there. But I am forced to do work pretty much all day, 12 hours a day. Washing cars. Scrubbing floors. Cleaning windows. Yard work. Basically 90% of chores for both sides of the house. I’m not allowed out of the house except for grocery runs or else they threaten to kick us out. My dad lost his job and my mom works limited hours so if they kick us out, we are on the streets

I only eat 1 meal a day. I’m fucking starving all the time and the constant work makes me want to pass out. Sometimes I get so hungry I start shaking and crying and want to fall over. It’s like I go crazy. I’ve lost 15 pounds. The constant labor is exhausting and makes me dizzy and want to pass out. I beg for more food but they say no. It pisses me off because they throw food out all the time, like yesterday they had a whole half of dominoes pizza left and just threw it away, still warm.

But it’s MY fault. Not the 24 year old sister who does nothing and doesn’t even pay rent, mine. Because even though I’m 15 and didn’t ask for this, I’m the male.",Smokerboyyy,t2_65ukp1ul,0.62,5,31

493,fvvztk,2020-04-06,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,I'm an MRA from Austria. The situation here is crazy,"So yeah I'll chip in. I'm an MRA from Austria. The perception/reputation of Austria is a very gender equal/feminist country, but this is only half true. Men face 3 major legal discriminations under the constitution. 

1. Conscription

2. Higher Pension Ages

3. Hiring discrimination

For conscription, this is national service, where you must join the military for 6 months. Its not optional, you must do it, but only boys have to do it. You can choose an alternative civil service instead, called *Zivildienst*, where you do labor for less than minimum wage. And by less than minimum wage, I mean you will starve. [Once upon a time we'd get 6 euro a day.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zivildienst_in_Austria#Compensation_for_Food) Guys would steal food, beg their female friends or older friends or relatives, etc. I got  about 12 Euro a day. I ate 2 crappy meals a day. I lost 20 pounds, which is normal.

It's bullshit. We're essentially doing free labor for society for nothing. We also received training which isn't allowed to be put on your resume for future employment because it's considered ""sexist"" because women won't have that training. This will be relevant for point 3.

For pension ages, the state pension age for men is 65, and 60 for women. This means a man can retire and collect pension at 65, and for women it's 60. So men must work 5 years longer. Even though we die 5 years younger! So we get 10 years less in retirement. 

For hiring discrimination, it's actually the law in Austria that if a man and woman both apply for a job, the job *must* go to a woman. So it takes a REALLY long time for men to start working. Women can pretty much start working right at age 18. It takes years for men to find work, usually men don't start working until 25/26 because you have to get lucky and apply to a job when a woman doesn't. I'm 24, almost all of my male friends are unemployed, and almost all of my female friends have been working for years. This is a ""thing"" in Austria, men under 25 are assumed to live at home and not work. I remember seeing a stat that said women are something like 10x more likely to get a callback for a job application. So if a woman sends out 10 applications, she'll get the same number of interviews as if a man sends out 100.

We're also forced to get re-certified in things we already learned to do during our national service. So literally have to repeat the course over again.

Yet all you hear about is feminism, how women are disadvantaged, how equality is important, etc. It's bullshit!

So yes, I am not a feminist but an MRA, because to me that is more ""equal""",grazer95,t2_64ya6xv6,1.0,124,35

However, certain events transpired during this process that caused it to be particular traumatizing for him, a fact that he remained silent about and never shared with his family.

His conclusion was that fathers and husbands make those kinds of sacrifices for their families all the time.  And that those sacrifices go unrecognized because part of that sacrifice is sparing your family from the burden of having to know about it.

Of course straight away people came in and said that this was a perfect example of ""toxic masculinity"" and that he should share what happened with his wife instead of keeping it bottled up.

I got to thinking though: had he shared this ordeal with his wife, or with any female family member, would he not at that point be guilty of creating ""emotional labor"" for the women living with him?

I don't know what the ""correct"" decision would be in this situation.  It probably just depends on the specific circumstances.

OCR 03222067 - Morgan State University. Investigation opened.

OCR 03222066 - Delaware State University. Investigation opened.

Based on these two, I expect the other three schools will be investigated as well.

Verizon is funding a scholarship ""game forward"" that discriminates on the basis of sex. This scholarship is partnered with five universities covered by Title IX and includes a guaranteed internship at the end. OCR spent months trying to kick this to other agencies as a way to stall creating an official complaint / case for it. After a senator's casework team said they would take a look at OCR's actions, OCR decided to finally do something. Within days of informing them that the senator's team was looking at it, OCR assigned case numbers and provisioned the case to regional offices. A couple days later and two investigations are already opened. Normally the time to review before investigation can take months to over a year and turnaround into an investigation this fast is unheard of.

# [Hackbright Complaint](https://www.reddit.com/r/MRA_TitleIX/comments/riz03y/ocr_08221033_investigation_opened_against_strayer/)

OCR 11222018 - Strayer University. Investigation opened.

OCR 08221033 - Hackbright Academy within Strayer University. Investigation opened.

Hackbright is a coding academy for anyone that isn't a cis-male. They allow anyone who doesn't have a cis-male gender identity to attend. This was started by Strayer University in flagrant violation of Title IX. I dug up a heap of public commentary and social media comments to make this case possible.

# Executive Women Courses

My complaints against Northwestern and Philadelphia running women-only executive training courses were both dismissed on grounds that those programs are already under investigation.

# Texas A&M Complaint and Appeal

I have not said much regarding this since this is a heavy case for which I have an attorney retained. My attorney said it was fine to talk about it or write publicly if I felt inclined. Texas A&M was running a heap of programs in violation of Title IX, including women-only mentoring, women-only for-credit classes, women-only job fairs, women-only engineering competition teams etc. Initially, I wrote complaints to the school (lesson learned: not a good idea). Upon inquiring for details of my cases, the school attorney told me that they won't provide information to me via ""informal"" avenues (which was me emailing them asking for info I was legally entitled to) as I *might* file federally. Taking adverse action against someone who has, or might use OCR's complaint process is illegal and is retaliation.

After contacting some people in the administration for the school regarding my cases, they had an internal email regarding their concern that I might be contacting more people. Shortly after that, my emails started going to spam. This resulted in me missing graduation when my advisor didn't get critical paperwork he needed to sign. My emails stopped going to spam shortly after the school had determined they had contacted people that I might try and reach out to at the school. To make matters worse for the school, the school didn't file most of my complaints officially in their internal system and instead were handling them in ""the spreadsheet."" Furthermore, the school was concocting resolutions with the programs I complained about while still in the ""review"" phase of determining if my complaints were valid. For at least one program, they didn't even inform me of the full extent of the resolution they made with the organization. They were also failing to inform me of the outcomes of cases at the same time as the organization I complained about. Internal emails also reveal that the school was closing my cases without informing me, and at one point even lied to me by telling me my cases were still in review despite working on resolutions. Much of this was revealed in internal school emails my attorney acquired via FOIA.

The school ruled that the women-only job fair *was* discriminatory but still awarded the organization with a diversity and inclusion award. The school ruled that a women-only for-credit class, and women-only competition teams were not a violation of Title IX, but only because they changed the wording and programming before issuing the dismissal. This is a clear violation of the school's duty to issue true judgements on violations. How can a class that auto-enrolls all female (but not male) freshman engineers *not* be a violation of Title IX? To date, the class still says it is ""focused"" on women despite being open to all genders. It is still unknown if  the school is still auto-enrolling people in classes based on their gender. OCR said the class is no longer a violation, which is perplexing.

OCR dismissed all but one of my complaints, without a single reference to the law as having informed their opinion. They also did not reference specific case details critical to the complaint. This makes it difficult to appeal when I must appeal on grounds that the facts of the case, the law, or case law were not properly applied or considered. I appealed within days of the dismissal anyway, mainly on grounds that they weren't considered *at all*. OCR then refused to acknowledge the appeal in multiple follow-ups from myself and my attorney, waiting beyond the 60 day deadline to appeal, marking a hostile stance to my appeal. Upon informing them that my senator's casework team was interested in the case and should have already sent a request for documents, OCR finally responded. They claim they sent my appeal to the appropriate field office the day after I filed but were unwilling to provide proof. They also attempted to justify refusing to inform me by citing that the case processing manual doesn't require them to. Very strange that OCR isn't required to say they got my appeal or inform me of which office is handling it. It was a *choice* by OCR to keep my attorney and I uninformed.

Originally, the senior OCR attorney working the case said that they expected my case to have ""high public visibility."" The senior attorney also said there were delays in review because they were going back and forth with DC on the case details. Once the guard changed back to Lhamon overseeing OCR, I was quickly issued a short dismissal. This whole case reeks of politics and of Lhamon's political intention to shut it down independent of the facts and in dereliction of OCR's mandate. Hence, they couldn't cite a single instance of law as informing their decision to dismiss, nor could they cite critical case details since it would have prevented dismissal. OCR will often select a case that will be high profile against a big university and make the resolution painful to the university in order to send a message to other schools. This case was anticipated to be that, and was shut down for political reasons rather than the facts of the case.

# Get Involved

Feel free to poke around my sub r/MRA_TitleIX and talk about writing Title IX complaints if you want to get involved. We need more people filing complaints against these kinds of programs in order to change the narrative. Some are going to be wrongly dismissed, but not all of them. The ones that are wrongly dismissed help show how bias OCR is in applying the law. Write your elected representatives about it, post about it on social media, help us change the narrative.

I tend to tackle harder cases, but there are a lot of easy cases out there. It is free and you aren't required to have an attorney. You don't have to attend the school you are complaining about either! It is easier to get started than you think. It can all be filed online in less than an hour.

I am a man, and personally, I have experienced unwanted flirting, and comments within most jobs I have worked at. Often from women who are in relationships and/or I would rather not date. To some, flirting in the workplace is just a fun way to pass the time, but it isn't something I am interested in doing causally. Flirting in the workplace, I find distracting and dangerous as it puts my income and livelihood on the line if something goes wrong. I rather keep my work life and personal life separate but feel pressured to flirt to avoid being labelled ""weird"" or not a team player.

I remember the media freaking out over a Vice interview (link below) where Jordan Peterson suggested that flirting in the workplace and sexualized male and female interactions could lead to sexual harassment. Can we have a sexually liberal workplace where flirting is, and dating is accepted, yet prevent sexual harassment from happening?

And I don't think this is a coincidence.  Everything considered equal, the trade offs that parents make greatly benefit women at the expense of men.

And while you often see feminists talk about this gender norm, it's usually only done in a way to attack men and paint it as something that harms women.

In the real world though, this rhetoric is actually used to justify this gender norm.  Instead of seeing it as exploitive, women everywhere use it to justify their lifestyle as ""earned"" through their unpaid and emotional labor, which is a very similar argument that traditionalists use.  Men are encouraged to earn and do more because their wives and girlfriends cook and clean.  It's only fair that he works an extra 10 hours a week and does the yard work because she spent her time caring for him and cooking him dinner.

As a result, men don't have the social capital to say, *""this isn't fair, I think you need to work more, and let me stay home more""*.  The fact that she works less is justified by this messaging in society, and is then ultimately blamed on him, instead of her life decisions.

And then she reaps the rewards in the form of less stress, a better work-life balance, more time at home, more time with the kids, guaranteed financial support, a better home life, better health outcomes, better social support from networking, a longer life, and implicit biases in family court.

That's not to say that there aren't mothers out there giving it their best.  But the road that turned them into homemakers is paved by feminism, not the actions of men, or the patriarchy.

But because our industry is all about things and solitary work, as opposed to people and relations, it attracts fewer women in general, and there is a big gender imbalance. And because we measure diversity at all levels as female to male ratio (we are in red!), men are simply discriminated against, in hiring, in promotions and in opportunities. 

Now the fun part: because we are so big on diversity, we get questionnaires via a 3rd party company on a regular basis. These are supposed to be anonymous - and while I have no reason to doubt it, I would never write openly about my opinions, just to be safe. But I always select the options indicating that yes, I have experienced discrimination at the job recently, that no, HR does not do a good job at protecting me from discrimination, and no, I certainly do not feel safe to speak about my case with the HR or my manager.

I imagine that this will only result in yet another program to better protect Black women :).

506,kzra9k,2021-01-18,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,About the wage gap...,"Firstly, let's put to rest the idea that the wage gap is the result of discrimination on the individual level. The Korn Ferry Gender Pay Index analysed more than 12.3 million employees in 14,284 companies in 53 countries.

They found that men were paid on average 16.1 per cent more than women on a global level. But the gap fell to 5.3 per cent globally when evaluating the same job levels alone, such as people holding a director position. The gap was further narrowed to 1.5 per cent when considering the same level at the same company. If men and women at the same job level and in the same company were also in the same function, the gap shrank to 0.5 per cent.

""In Asia, the study found that women make, on average, 15 per cent less than their male counterparts. The average gap is widest - at 19.3 per cent - in Asia's mature markets, like Australia and New Zealand. But in Asia's growth markets like China and India, the gap is lower at 14.4 per cent; in the fast-growing markets like Indonesia and Vietnam, the gap narrows further to 11.5 per cent.""

""Female employees are actually favoured in fast growing markets. Women in these markets are paid 1.3 percent more than men working at the same level at the same company. Women are paid 3.1 per cent more than men at the same level, company and function in these markets.""""

[https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/fewer-women-in-good-paying-jobs-not-unequal-wages-behind-gender-pay-gap-korn](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/fewer-women-in-good-paying-jobs-not-unequal-wages-behind-gender-pay-gap-korn)

If you're arguing with a feminist and you present them these stats to counter the idea that the wage gap is caused by discrimination, they have a few choices. They can continue to cling to the idea that the residual 0.5% global gap favouring men is caused by wage discrimination - at which point, in order to maintain the facade of impartiality and logical consistency, they'd also have to admit that men are discriminated against and women are favoured in these fast-growing markets where they found a 3.1% gap favouring women - or, they'd have to admit that there are other additional factors that haven't been taken into account which can explain the 0.5% residual gap.

Their final choice is to contend that the discrimination does not happen on an individual basis, but that there is discrimination on the level of occupations and fields. Devaluation theory theorises that a higher value is attributed to jobs or occupations typically carried out by men or associated with male-stereotyped skills and so discrimination does not take place against individuals but against the types of jobs that they do. Based on these arguments, devaluation theory suggests that male-dominated occupations are more highly-rewarded than female-dominated occupations because ‘women’s work’ is devalued by social structures. 

However, there is basically no evidence for this assertion. This study tackles such claims. (Note, the link leads to a pdf that downloads)

[https://osf.io/5u2nn/download](https://osf.io/5u2nn/download)

This study attempted to conduct the most rigorous test to date of the devaluation conjecture with regards to fields of study. They analysed data from the HIS Graduate Panel Study 1997 (N=4092), which allowed them to measure and control for characteristics that remained unobserved in earlier studies. What they found disconfirmed the idea that occupations which were dominated by women were being devalued because they were dominated by women. Instead, the reason why female-dominated occupations had lower wages was because women were more likely than men to self-select into disciplines that supplied cultural resources rather than fields which provided primarily economic resources. The latter, however, are known to be in higher labor market demand and thus to yield higher wages.

As the authors themselves say ""Our results confirm Gerber and Cheung’s skepticism about adopting the causal interpretation to be found in earlier studies because our evidence leads to the probability that the relationship between sex composition and pay was *entirely* due to unobserved variable bias: earlier studies neglected the fact that fields vary in the degree to which they provide economic or cultural capital. We find that women disproportionately self-select into the latter, men into the former, and that this almost entirely explains the association between sex composition and wages. Based on this result, we extend Gerber and Cheung’s caution against hasty causal interpretations to evidence for devaluation from fixed-effects models because we doubt that the degree to which a discipline provides cultural or economic capital should be treated as time-constant.""

""\[T\]he effect of sex composition on wages as derived from devaluation theory withers away entirely once we control for other field characteristics... Once we take into account that fields differ in more respects than just their sex composition, *we find that sex composition itself is entirely unrelated to pay*.""

And if any feminist links you some study showing that the wage declines whenever a field turns from being male-dominated to female-dominated and asks ""Well, why does that happen? It's the same field, but the wage still declined when women went into it"" without also considering if the extent to which that occupation provides economic or cultural capital has changed overtime is, as the authors say, making a ""hasty causal interpretation"".

Women generally choose fields of study that furnish students with more cultural than economic capital and fewer quantitative skills. Fields that provide few economic capital and few quantitative skills should pay less for purely economic reasons. If a field changes from primarily providing economic capital to cultural capital, you'll see a drop in the wage, but also an increase in the amount of women who want to go into that field. That does not mean women's entry into a field or occupation causes a decline in wages any more than the finding that people in the UK tend to spend more in the shops when it's cold and less when it's hot means cold weather causes frenzied high-street spending. Drawing spurious conclusions about causality based solely off correlation is not a strong argument.",problem_redditor,t2_3cc6xril,0.96,51,32

* I am less likely to be a victim of violent assault than a man.
* When i'm a victim of domestic violence or controlling behavior from my partner i get supported instead of being mocked.
* The government spend billions of dollars to provide shelters for me if i need them to get out of an abusive relationships.
* When i commit domestic violence against my male partner people will laugh or assume that he must did something to me. 
* I will probably live longer than a man.
* When i'm a victim of sexual harassment in the workplace the human resource department take my complaint more seriously.
* When i'm a victim of sexual abuse i will receive empathy and support instead of mockery.
* As a girl if i get taken advantage of by an adult i will be supported instead of being told i'm lucky.
* The media and politicians talk 24/7 that respecting me is important while the same people will make excuses if i insult men and boys and call them trash.
* My chances of suffering a work-related injury or illness are significantly lower than for a man.
* My chances of dying on the job are a small fraction of a man's.
* Both left and right political parties debate and get asked by media how they will improve my well being. and the government create special agency for me even in area where i'm more privileged than men (example: Women's Health Office exist but there is no Men's Health Office)
* Genital mutilation against me is considered horrific by society, considered illegal and even the UN campaign against it.
* If I interact with other people's children (particularly people I don't know very well), I don't have to worry too much that the interaction will be misinterpreted.
* My role in my children's life is generally perceived as more important than their father's role.
* I'm more likely to get custody of the children after divorce.
* When i'm an adult i get the right to vote automatically without signing for the draft unlike men.
* Mainstream media say society should believe me just because i'm a woman.
* Mainstream media write articles about how i'm morally superior without getting any backlash.
* When i insult men and get a backlash from that people will side with me and accuse the others of being sexist against me instead of asking me to apologize.
* If a create an organization that focus on my rights and issues i get support from media and there are multiple rich foundations that provide funding.

This LinkedIn study from 2019 used their internal data to examine differences between men and women when job searching. Among the key findings are the fact that men and women view a similar number of jobs though women apply to 20% fewer. A recruiter is 13% more likely to view a man's profile which she described as result of a problematic bias that must be corrected (even though they also found that recruiters will still contact both genders at equal rates).

However, the author (Maria Ignatova) makes no effort to hide her own bias (and sexism) by writing:

>The good news is that when women do apply to a job, they are 16% more likely than men to get hired. In fact, if the role is more senior than their current position, that number goes up to 18%.While this is an uplifting stat, it does show that women do a very thorough job at vetting roles — sometimes maybe too thorough. If women only apply when they feel extremely qualified, this could also indicate they are not pursuing stretch opportunities.

Linkedin is a mainstream website, not a fringe feminist blog. Yet blatant discrimination in hiring practices is celebrated as ""good news"" and as ""uplifting stat(s)"". This doesn't lead to equality, it's just another piece of evidence that equality isn't the actual goal.

Her analysis is also very weak and uses the usual strategy of reframing all issues so that women are the real victims. I think a more plausible hypothesis for why men apply to 20% more jobs is because if we are getting rejected more often then we need to submit more applications to increase our chances of finding work. Of course I would submit fewer if I was getting offers at 16-18% higher rate.

For most of us, this is just seeing statistics that support what we already knew is happening. The worst part is just being gaslit, and told this is ""equality"" and if we have a problem with it we are misogynist or examples of ""toxic masculinity"".

It's incredibly frustrating because these are the same people that literally DEMAND that I, as a man, fight for women's issues (and often discount men's under the guise that some ""trickle-down equality"" will occur). 


Usually these people will say something like misogyny is so bad that they couldn't *possibly* spend any time or energy advocating for any male issue because that's taking resources away from women. They then go on to say how advocacy isn't a zero-sum game.


I'm just over it all.

But that ignores the fact that men do more paid work than women -- which is the biggest reason for that gap.   In fact when both partners work full time, men put in 63 hours combined work per week, with women only putting in 62 hours.

So at the end of the day, men are just as tired, and have just as little free time as women.  In fact men have less free time than women when all is said and done.

If women want men to do more ""cooking and cleaning"", then they need to take equivalent burdens off the shoulders of men for that to happen.  Things like yard work, home maintenance, and overtime at work so he can come home earlier.  Not to mention all the other things women expect out of men: driving / chauffeuring, pest control, checking on things in the middle of the night, running erands, auto maintenance, etc.

Because that is what ultimately creates that division of labor.  Men are more than doing their fair share around the house.  And it's about time we started demanding recognition for that.

He was responding to a post on AITA where he claimed the OP was lying, and he was being mistreated. It’s a little messy and weird; the original OP denied it and honestly the 15 year old boy might indeed be trolling.

But that’s not what this is about- it’s about the comments the got upvoted, and what they represent.

In the story, his father and mother are renting 2 rooms from his half-sister. They share a duplex? Double house? I’m not sure, but with the half-sister and her husband (33/35) and their 3 year old, the half sisters mother, and another 24 year old half sister.

The boys claims to be starving and only eating one meal per day. He’s forced to do chores for a whole household they are renting from his half sister (who throws food away even though she knows he is starving). He has apparently lost 20 pounds. He does 90% of the chores for both “sides”, even though his family is paying, not their as “guests.” The 24 year old sister does nothing.

He was CRUCIFIED. He was bullied and shamed and blamed, called entitled, called the asshole, etc. it’s a shame you can’t see his original post, but it was rather shocking and sounds like borderline abuse. 

But the comments he got...in the thread, you can still see the comments, and that’s the point...scroll through his comments, see what he says, and then see what responses he gets...completely nuts.

He was bullied and shamed. [This comment thread in particular](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/fxihf9/holy_shit_i_am_the_halfbrother_currently/fmuo4g5/) was *awful*...he was made out to be the villain in the story. For being a starving teenager used for cheap labor?

He’s the child of the household being treated the most harshly. And I absolutely agree it’s sexism that no one would say that if he was a girl; they’d say the brothers are abusive assholes for forcing her to do domestic labor and then letting her starve. But oh yeah, one thing he was accused of is “woman bashing”.

So that’s misandry today. 15 year old boys who do everyone’s chores and starves is treated more harshly than a 24 year old woman who does nothing, and a 33 year old who throws food away despite knowing he is starving

The thing is, even if he *is* trolling, the thought process of the comments are frightening. The way he was attacked simply for being starving and desperate...it was shocking even for someone used to widespread misandry.",Kotterlane,t2_65n9cax7,0.84,29,28

A massive federal investigation into Texas Woman's University *SYSTEM* (TWU) was just opened up as a result of my activism. If you want to read the details, [check out the post in my sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/MRA_TitleIX/comments/10yz2vl/06222136_texas_womans_university_system_several/) which breaks it down. You can also [look at the investigation letter](https://www.scribd.com/document/627583772/06222136-TWU-NDL-C?secret_password=36tppox1vx3L5xKeMMNd) I received from the Dept of Education Office of Civil Rights (OCR).

While I am excited to see such a major investigation opened, I always take time to reflect and look at issues within the system of civil rights enforcement, and something stood out to me with this. There are three elements the investigation is not looking into, and I want to talk about two of them:

1. The TWU System discriminates against males based on sex when the state of Texas passed alaw, Senate Bill 1126, that the TWU system is only “focusing on only one gender attending theUniversity, despite it not having a \[one sex\] admissions policy.”

>\[...\]  
>  
>3. The TWU System has not awarded a Student Regent position to a man.

# Allegation 1

The TWU system, as a matter of state law, is in violation of Title IX. [SB1126](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/pdf/SB01126F.pdf#navpanes=0) states:

>The Texas Woman’s University System is a woman-focused system

Trying to cover my bases, I wrote the complaint against TWU and the state itself. OCR dismissed the case *against the state* on jurisdiction grounds that I think made sense (I am still learning). They dismissed this part of the case *against TWU* because:

>Based on our review of your complaint, **you did not provide any information sufficient in indicating** that the TWU System has denied enrollment to males or **is involved any act or the application of any policy that you believed was discriminatory or unlawful under one of the laws that OCR enforces**, nor did you provide such information in your complaint or supporting documents submitted to OCR with respect to this allegation.  \[bold added\]

The part in bold is perplexing, as this was *in the letter* announcing investigation into such issues. The evidence of their engagement in these violations, along with the fact that it is state mandated was all contained in the complaint. The fact that it is state mandated and a defining factor in the authorization of the university system is absolutely relevant. The state made a university system on the premise of violating federal law, I provided evidence that they have violated federal law, and it is has been going on for decades. Federal funding should be pulled. It is a dereliction of duty for OCR ignore that this University system if founded and authorized on a statement of focus that violates Title IX.

This statement of law is not arbitrary or unrelated in practice. I have clearly demonstrated a litany of violations, including the state using the school to illegally provision workshops and grants..... which is under investigation as of this letter. In the next part of this post, you can see in practice how this impacts the perception of the board of regents on what the school is about.

# Allegation 3

I had provided OCR with documentation regarding the Student Regent position for the TWU system. Since inception, it has only be awarded to women. The odds of this happening by random chance are less than 10%.

[One of the qualifications](https://web.archive.org/web/20220609160951/https://twu.edu/student-life-office/student-regent/apply-for-%20student-regent/) is that the applicant “\[h\]ave a strong desire to represent all universitystudents.” It takes no leap of faith to infer that TWU, or men themselves, think men can’t represent the predominantly female student body of a “woman focused” university system. Furthering this, thestudent regent applications are [reviewed by the Chancellor, and two are given to the Governor of Texas for approval](https://web.archive.org/web/20220609162136/https://twu.edu/student-life/student-life-news/twu-seeks-%20student-regent-applicants-for-2021-2022/). I find it hard to believe that bias is not at play when even the applicants must go through approval of people who already think this University is by and for women. In fact, we see this in statements by the Board of Regents. When Brookelyn Bush was acknowledged for her service on [5/20/2022 in a board meeting](https://livestream.com/accounts/13910602/events/4836520/videos/231224282) Regent Wright (\~20mins in) says what the Student Regent position is all about:

>Your commitment to excellence is representative of the women at Texas Women’s \[sic\] University. I know you are inspiring many other women by your leadership and that is what this is all about.

It is about women and for women, in their own words. It is not about representing students. It is not about inspiring students. It is “all about” representing and inspiring women as a woman. This is seen all over in the board meeting, and publications by them. The board goes on (\~1:15:16) to reaffirm themission statement:

>Texas Woman’s University cultivates engaged leaders and global citizens by leveraging its historical strengths in health, liberal arts, and education and its standing as the nation’s largest **public university primarily for women**. Committed to transformational learning, discovery, and service in an inclusive environment that embraces diversity, Texas Woman’s inspires excellence and a pioneering spirit. \[bold added\]

Regents Wilson and Coleman both motioned to approve. The motion passed with a unanimous votewithout discussion. Dr. Carine M. Feyten, Chancellor and President, goes on to discuss athletics (1:20:00) and says “you want to respect what’s at your core, and your mission, and your values \[...\] I think what we’ve done in athletics is demonstrating that.”

The [administrative overview](https://twu.edu/media/documents/irdm/OverviewPub.pdf) by the board of regions confirms more of the same bias, bold added by me:

>Texas Woman’s University is a Doctoral, Professions Dominant public university, **primarily for women**, offering baccalaureate, master’s and doctoral degree programs. A teaching and research institution, the University emphasizes the liberal arts and sciences and specialized or professional studies. Texas Woman’s University is the largest university **primarily for women** in the United States.\[...\]Texas Woman’s University is a pioneer in preparing women to pursue careers in such fields as allied health, librarianship, nursing, nutrition, social work, and teaching. As other opportunities have become available, the University has **made a special commitment to attract women** to study in mathematics, the natural and physical sciences, and business. Undergraduate and selected graduate programs are **offered to increase the participation of women** in fields in which women have been historically under represented.\[...\]  
>  
>Texas Woman’s University **educates women to excel and to assume leadership roles** in both traditional and nontraditional endeavors. The training of women as leaders and decision makers is crucial to the progress of women and society. The University **seeks to provide an academic and social climate for women to develop and use their leadership skills to serve society**. Through work with campus and student organizations, as well as through involvement in  institutional governance, Texas Woman’s University affords students formal and informal opportunities to become leaders.\[...\]In 1988, the Science and Mathematics Center for Women at TWU began the Access to Careers in the **Sciences Camps (ACES) for girls** completing the sixth through eleventh grades. The residential summer camps provide the information and “hands-on” experiences needed to encourage girls to make realistic career choices in the mathematics and science fields. The program has grown from 13 to more than 80 participants and has been recognized by Duke University as one of the top programs of its kind in the nation.

# Thoughts

In short, as matter of state law this University is ""woman focused"" in violation of Title IX. This school only exists under authority of the state. I have provided ample evidence of this impacting things like missions statements and actual actions of the University. It should come at no surprise that it has one of the worst gender gaps for undergrad (13% male 2020 data). For graduate and professional education, it has the worst gender gap (10% men) for universities with more than 500 students.

The school has been around since 1901 and was women-only. In 1972 Title IX passed and they opened some programs to men. In 1994 they opened all their programs to men. They made no real effort to transition to a school that didn't have a ""one-sex"" admissions policy. Male-only schools were required to submit transition plans and take affirmative steps toward integration and compliance, I have requested a copy of the plan that TWU submitted via FOIA. TWU seems to have forgotten that compliance is actually a thing that is required. For example, TWU had sports teams before Title IX passed. Yet, here we are with rampant violations in their athletics program.

The irony of all this is that TWU decided to celebrate Title IX turning 50 last year. Their athletics twitter handle made a series of posts about how great Title IX is and that it is the reason these women can compete in ""boys sports."" I called them out on it while announcing the federal investigation a couple days ago, and they blocked me (first amendment violation for a state school to do this). Title IX compels schools to have athletic scholarships and roster slots proportional to student enrollment of men and women. The school is responsible for compliance. Prior to Title IX, there was *nothing* preventing a school from making a women's team if they wanted to. The school has been in control every step of the way, and the only way that Title IX would have given these women this opportunity is if the school *itself* had been denying it to them. But that isn't the case for these women, and never has been the case at this school. As I said, this celebration was ironic because not only is Title IX *not* the reason these women get to be on these sports teams, the college is actively violating the very component of it they are trying to herald.

The investigation occurring at all is good, but it leaves a lot to be desired and the parts not investigated show a disregard for the law and men's civil rights. This case will absolutely be getting a chapter in the book I am working on. I think it is good at highlighting the complete indifference to discrimination that shows up in enforcement. When state law can define a university system in violation of federal law, it should not be receiving funding that is based on it being compliant.

The tldr is that child support laws are logically in violation of the 13th Amendment, as well as The Peonage Abolition Act of 1867, which was passed to address shortfalls in the 13th Amendment.

Peonage is a form of labor exploitation that uses debt as a system to control workers.  In Medieval Europe, this practice existed in the form of serfdom, where men (and sometimes women) were given a debt to pay back to their lord for simply existing and living on their land.

Even if they were able to pay back this debt, it was impractical to live your life as a truly free individual because of how much you depended on your lord.  Which was a situation that was artificially created by the lords themselves.

In the US, there is a long history of voluntary indentured servitude, coerced servitude, slavery, as well as legal and institutionally facilitated debt slavery, for example through the prison industrial complex. The later became popular after the abolition of slavery in Southern states, and still exists in many forms to this day.

The NYT editorial board published an opinion piece calling for the [reinstatement of male only conscription](https://archive.is/xVU4n)

You may not see why the suggestion is male only at first glance, but this is an example of ""step 1""...slowly easing into the idea. Take some quotes:

>James’s focus on male service and industrial tasks is largely obsolete today. But his fundamental argument...

Well, but...

>It is hard to imagine a government levying penalties on young people who do not want to do what is essentially volunteer work, unless it was offered as an alternative to mandatory military service, with women now also liable. That is not likely to happen, as Mr. Buttigieg acknowledged.

Isn't it strange how gender is a specific part of the vocabulary used? They again remind people that 'women will be included', as if prepping them to accept a male only system.


>What could be objectionable in asking all young people to pause before plunging into the scramble of adult life to donate some of their time and energies to some socially beneficial, critically needed service at home or abroad?

How can it possibly be stipulated ""what is the objection to forced service?""

Lowering the age of retirement for men by 6 or 7 years would be difficult to achieve politically and may face constitutional challenges. Similar difficulties could arise basing it off of life expectancy or race.

A solution that could withstand such challenges would be to:

1. Create an option of social security retirement benefit as a [perpetuity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perpetuity.asp), that pays out the remaining present value at death to the estate. If men choose this and die earlier, they would be compensated appropriately at payout to their estate.

2. Allow earlier retirement as an option (with a smaller perpetuity, of course). Men or less-healthy individuals could choose to retire earlier to still get a good retirement age, while point 3 would give higher monthly payments to make it worthwhile.

3. Insurance companies come in and allow you to convert your perpetuity to a lifetime annuity, which would pay out a higher monthly amount until you die. The insurance could take your health and sex into account, which would give men and minorities on average higher monthly payouts. Healthier people might not want to retire as early because their monthly payouts would be too low. Also allow a public option for this, to remove losses to corporate money grabbing.

This would not give all men and minorities higher payments or earlier retirements, but it would give those closer to death that option which in aggregate would help men and minorities.",austin101123,t2_8xuqv,0.83,29,8

There is a hell of a lot of space in the middle here. Surely we want a debate which argues that the advancement of women is right and important, but that also allows for an open discussion about the place of men in the new society and economy.  
>  
>We want men to engage in these discussions, but I hear a public conversation that seems to infer that all men are one homogenous group – and that’s a barrier.  It is absolutely the case that a group of economically and socially privileged men are the big winners in the future of work.

524,hly6e5,2020-07-06,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Curious if others have experienced this: Pushback against men being successful financially,"To be clear, this is not saying all men must strive to be rich. It is saying, there is substantial pushback against those of us who have/are doing well for ourselves. As I see it, there seems to be an underlying view that men's role is to support women in seeking financial success, NOT to achieve it ourselves.

It seems that on a societal level there is a pretty substantial push against this. ""The future is female"" is pretty clear--the future of growth industries like tech is for women. Not men. Working as a software developer I see this play out in small and large ways on a fairly regular basis. Here's how:

* I got dual bachelors degrees, neither in CS. After I taught myself to code and got a job in the field, a close friend attacked me and spent hours telling me exactly how she felt I got my job only because I was a white man, not due to any skill I possessed. It didn't seem to matter that the only other candidate considered was also a white man.
* At my current job, emphasis is given to hiring women. Girls straight out of college get jobs men need 5 years experience for.
* Girls seem to have a strong sense of entitlement to STEM work. I mentored a girl (intern) from the local university. Within 2 weeks of being brought onboard, she told me she thought all men were trash. Apparently 8 months of help and using my code to get out of jams she couldn't figure out didn't make a difference.
* When a major presentation for development comes up, it *always* goes to a woman. The team lead and manager is a guy and 2/3 of senior developers are men. They never get asked to present. Our only senior female developer is busy so the next company-wide development presentation fell to the said intern who was hired a month ago. None of the men were asked.

These are a mix of my experiences both at a personal level and society-wide level. It seems to me that part of feminism is demanding men step aside from high-social-status roles so women can hold them.

The idea being that for equality to be present, the outcomes must be 50-50, with no thought given to the personal effect from the fact that substantially more men want to achieve these goals than women.

To me, the functional outcome of this is individual-level discrimination in the name of equalizing group-level metrics. What have others experienced? How do you view this?",smeltaway,t2_4efw24c0,0.97,65,33

>i'm disappointed that the community does not seem to like the hard work of self-examination

And it reminded me of one of the biggest gripes men have with menslib. 

The persistent framing of male issues as merely personal and outright denial that men may face sexism or discrimination at an institutional level. 

I'm also reminded of the proposal at Simon Fraser University (near Vancouver) to open up a men's centre on campus to address issues like suicide, drug/alcohol addiction, and negative stereotypes.

The women's centre, which already existed, opposed this.

 They argued that a men's centre is not needed because the men's centre is already ""everywhere else"" (even though those issues aren't being addressed ""everywhere else""). The alternative they proposed was a ""male allies project"" to ""bring self-identified men together to talk about masculinity and its harmful effects""

Now, to me this illustrates something very clearly. 

And that is that the widespread feminist viewpoint is that there is a problem with men. Or that men themselves are the problem. 

This is why feminist attempts at addressing men's issues usually just ends up victim blaming men. 

People often get upset at men's advocates for ""just wanting to bash feminism"" 

But unfortunately if we want to actually work towards egalitarian goals. That means we must challenge and deconstruct these negative and counterproductive beliefs about men. 

If anybody needs to do some introspection or self examination. It's the people who are upset because they don't understand why we oppose feminism.

531,16qhtc0,2023-09-23,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,"I think sexism towards men and women should viewed as equivalent to ageism rather than equivalent to how racism, homophobia or ableism works. Here's why","It's a common misconception that sexism towards women is motivated by hatred of women and wanting them to suffer. Hell, people here often assume that sexism towards men works that way. Well, it doesn't. Racism was fueled by hating black people and wanting to ruin their lives. Same with homophobia, transphobia and even ableism. People hated black people and didn't view them as human. People hated gay people and thought they were sickos. People thought disabled people shouldn't be allowed to produce.

But men and women? There was never a hatred of the two. The Hostility Toward Women and Hostility Toward Men Scales just measure how harsh people can be towards one of the sexes but it doesn't determine if somebody straight up hates men or women. Feminists hate men, but feminism is an ideology. First, consider these ideas:

* [Most sexism towards women is benevolent sexism](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/14amrtm/most_sexism_towards_women_is_benevolent_sexism/), not hostile sexism, and a lot of evidence shows that across the globe, hostility towards men is more common than hostility towards women. Most of the time when people think women shouldn't do certain things men can do, just like how they don't think men shouldn't do certain things women do, it has to do with social norms, not hatred of a certain gender. Sometimes, such as when women are not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia or unveil themselves, it has to do with believing women need to be protected and worrying they'd be catcalled or someone will harm them, and feminists always act like only women are in danger walking out at night, even though most street criminals typically harm men and often spare women. Most sexism towards women is kind, infantilizing sexism that cherishes them in a very protective but infantilizing manner. In fact, hatred of women was never the norm.
* [Gender roles were invented because of how people thought men and women should be in order to make our species prosper](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/16g3kg9/most_of_the_changes_in_gender_roles_for_men_and/), not out of hatred for a certain gender. This is also why age roles exist. The reason gender roles became less of a necessity over time is because of society becoming more economically and medically advanced, such as higher population densities, low infant/maternal mortality rates, higher life expectancies, etc., not feminism. That's why so many ""developing"" countries have traditional gender roles, including in marriage. It's because they don't have the pill, high population densities, low maternal/child mortality, high life expectancy, etc.
* Ageism works the same kind of way. A man named Robert Epstein wrote a book on how the underdeveloped brains of teens has to do with socialization and not biology, and how historically, teens were learning how to become adults and had adult responsibilities, and extending childhood to 18 and even restricting responsibilities for young adults caused irresponsibility and underdeveloped brains, not biology. He cites a lot of good evidence to back up what he says, and teens have more restrictions on their freedoms than even former prisoners. His book could even apply to early young adults now, too. Ageism towards the elderly also exists in healthcare, jobs, etc.
* People have never exactly hated men and wanted them to suffer nor did people feel that way towards women. People can have harsher attitudes towards men and benevolent, infantilizing attitudes towards women but that has to do with gender roles based on how they believe men and women should be. Black people, on the other hand, were violently hated.

Essentially men have always liked defending their women, from a tribalistic point of view anyway, it wasn't until the Idustrial Revolution that this behavior sorta started being challenged, right? Because the Industrial Revolution tried to take the enviromental factors that be behind having very prayful environments for women and children. From a survival standpoint, it also makes sense


If you have 10 women and 1 man, the man can reproduce his way to the top and start a new tribe


But if your tribe has 5 women and 20 men, the men would literally kill eachother for breeding rights, I think this is what so many men mean when they say  that remark of ""men sometimes hunt p-word for sport""


So in modern times, what gives to the point still that people react more harshly to misogyny than misandry?

Unironically it may also be chivalry and the infantilization of women sugarcoated as benevolent sexism by feminists, feminists like to pray on the fact women are still seen as the more defenseless gender by society, they weaponize this to their advantage and make it so feminism is still seen as valid advocacy on the behalf of women's welfare and safety.


The funny thing is been already revealed plenty of times that feminists missrepresent their stats so much left and right, but nobody gives a fuck because they control the press


**So what are my solutions to combat this empathy gap between men and women's sexism?**


Some possible solutions are

1. Always remain the civil one in the debate or any kind of social discourse, remember Marther Luther King didn't become a black supremacist overnite, we have to learn how to maintain composure and not overreact

2. Start calling out the feminist stats as they are

3. Show that you still want a society where women are allowed to express themselves as feminists if they want to, I may hate feminism to its core, but even I don't want it banned or supressed or criminalized, there are legit countries where civic civil feminist protesting of any kind is banned, Mexico and Bolivia are prime examples and China legit banned online feminist content. Remember we want diplomacy, not war mongering


4. Start holding male feminists, white knights and tradcons accountable, because they hold back male advocacy far more than even your most hardcore radical feminists ever would

'The Invention Of Child Support' by Drew Hansen covers the history of Child Support, and also accidentally uncovers the history of working class struggle, the history of the shift toward female bias in the legal system in general, and if you look closely enough \*squints insanely\* you'll find a precursor explanation and fraudulent legal basis for the role of contemporary Feminism as an anti-socialist, pro-capitalist, anti-egalitarian movement.

**Thesis:**

The author begins with a thesis that American Discourse on Child Support can be viewed historically and presently as:

>""First, child support enforcement is an anti-dependency measure. Politicians want to enforce child support orders because they are worried that the country is spending too much money on welfare and because they think that increasing child support collections will lower poverty rates among single mothers. Second, nonpayment of child support is a serious crime that should be punished by the criminal law. Americans today conceptualize child support in terms of preventing dependency and in terms of punishing those who ""cause"" dependency.""

He calls this a dependency-punishment framework and shows us that this sidesteps a need or desire for a system that takes care of all children regardless of economic status, at the expense of Men.

**The Catalyst:**

* Child Labor went from acceptable in the early 19th century to a moral wrong sanctioned in 14 States by the 1840s. Middle Class families wanted their children in schools. Poor Families who used Child Labor to survive no longer could.""

>""Beginning in the nineteenth century, this view of children as economic assets began to give way to a more romantic, idealized view of childhood among the middle and upper classes.""  
>  
>""...The rise in the divorce rate, the emergence of maternal preference in child custody, and the new value placed on childrearing combined to make it difficult for single mothers to support their children without relying on local poor-relief.""

* The ""Poor Laws"" were ineffective, overburdened, and evil. These laws essentially provided public funding for wealthy individuals to exploit forced labor in [brutal conditions](https://www.history.com/news/in-the-19th-century-the-last-place-you-wanted-to-go-was-the-poorhouse), allowing for the imprisonment of able-bodied Men who refused to work and a deficit of public spending that [destroyed society](https://www.portland-place.co.uk/docs/HISTORY_REVSION_TWO.pdf). Women could often receive board as a servant in a wealthy household but the increasing volume of single mothers exceeded this more sympathetic position.
* I don't even have time to go into the Industrial Revolution, except to focus here on how it transformed people into worker bees. In this situation, as in practically everything, it was worse for Men.
* Slavery, The Civil War. The attitudes of a slavery society have persisted to 2021 where slavery is still legal either through prisons or exported labor. The mass death of Men in the Civil War was the equivalent of about 8 million men dying today. The United States has a violent and storied anti-labor history, and this is deeply connected to the history of feminism as a patronage ideology to justify this male disposability. 
* The  judicial ruling class believes in the english system of law, class privileges, and the idea of 'natural duty'. This is vital.
* Men pushed into poverty by industrial capitalists, who were faced with the 'choice' of trying to 'support' their family by leaving them to live in poor houses, a bad or failing marriage, cheating, or a society that deeply wanted to enslave, punish or kill them could simply leave.

>*""As population growth overwhelmed the colonial poor-relief system, towns could not keep up with individual cases of desertion.""*  
>  
>*""The growth of large cities gave men who wanted to leave their families many places where they could go with relative anonymity. At the same time, the expansion of the shipping and manufacturing industries made it easier for men to take their labor power from one place to another. By early in the nineteenth century, wife desertion was starting to emerge as a major social problem.""*

* Divorce was not materially possible for the working poor, see: elitist, for-profit legal system.

**The Invention Of Child Support (**[and Alimony](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/62558423.pdf)**)**

>*""The pace of the rise in divorce varied by region, but by 1850 there was a clearly observable national trend toward marital breakdown. Women often successfully sued for divorce in the nineteenth century by charging their husbands with fault in causing the divorce. The most common grounds for divorce among women in the nineteenth century were desertion or cruelty on the part of their husbands.""*

This trend of gaining legal favor with accusations of abuse never ended and is now a fully for-profit industry.

*""American courts in the nineteenth century addressed the problem of dependency among single mothers and their children by creating a legally enforceable child support duty. A legal child support obligation was unknown to English law, a fact that was repeatedly noted by courts and commentators skeptical of the new duty. But for the courts that supported the new doctrine (which was the majority view by the end of the century), the danger of dependency among single mothers-seen both as poverty and as dependency on the state--was enough to justify their departure from precedent. Courts early in the nineteenth century referred to concerns about dependency in the first American child support decisions.* ***From mid-century to 1900, American courts consolidated the child support obligation, reasoning in a discourse of fault and punishment as they addressed dependency among single mothers.****""*

In other words, although there was no legal basis for enforcing the payment of child support and it even violated the rights of Men to enforce it - \*Child Support was ultimately enforced to avoid having the State pay for welfare.\* Instead, Men would pay for this new social safety net themselves. **The money often would not go to single mothers, it would often go poorhouse capitalists and wealthy ""philanthropists"" who could now sue the Fathers in recompense for taking care of their families.**

>*""However, courts usually placed an additional burden on single mother plaintiffs that they did not place on third-party plaintiffs. Single mothers who wanted to recover for child support had to prove not only that their husband had failed to provide for the children, but also that the husband was at fault for causing the divorce. If the wife was at fault, she could not recover child support.""*

In a landmark case, Eitel v. Walter,

>*""I think a more humane doctrine, prevails here, and that the father is held liable for necessaries, or, in other words, the law will imply a contract on his part, if he refuses or neglects to perform his natural duty to his offspring."" ' Those who questioned the new doctrine were astounded at the readiness of most American courts to promote it.66 Even James Schouler, the author of a renowned treatise on domestic relations, who accepted the new child support doctrine, admitted that it was ""to be justified rather by public policy than the well-understood liabilities of the father, as defined by Blackstone.""*

^(\*Blackstone wrote the book that became the basis for Americans porting over English Law (huge mistake imo, the english viewed class privilege as unquestionable authority))

By the mid-nineteenth century the father was almost always blamed for marital failure. This 'blame' emerged not from reality, possibly from sexism, but definitely because the courts wanted fathers to be the social safety net and reduce the burden on the state and on the wealthy who exploited them ruthlessly.

>*""Once the child support duty had been legally established, many of the early child support claims were brought by individuals who had provided food, board, or clothing to impoverished single mothers and their children and wanted to recover their outlays from the present or former husband.°*   
>  
>*In Reynolds v. Sweetser,9"" for example, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts authorized John Reynolds's bid for recovery from Stephen Sweetser when Sweetser's wife and child had left him after he had physically abused them. The court reasoned that Reynolds could recover because Sweetser had ""made no suitable provision, either at his own home or elsewhere, for the mother and child"" and had ""utterly failed... to relieve \[his child\] from the absolute destitution to which by his neglect and misconduct it had been exposed.""92 The keys to this decision are ""absolute destitution"" and the father's ""neglect and misconduct"": The wife and child were destitute because of an abusive husband and father; the court was quick to authorize recovery for the generous individual who came to their aid.""*

This didn't remove women from poorhouses however, it only made them reliant on them. No mention whatsoever of how safe a child in a stranger's household who views them as being in their debt. The only thing the legal system cared about was protecting the rich through enabling forced labor. The author provides other early court precedents for demanding support not just of Father's but of any any Man involved with the woman.

>*What was the ""public policy"" that justified the invention of a child support duty in nineteenth-century America? Some insights are provided by the two earliest American child support cases: Stanton v. Willson,6' decided by the Connecticut Supreme Court in 1808, and Van Valkinburgh v.Watson,69 decided by the New York Supreme Court of Judicature in 1816.A desire to guard against dependency-in the dual sense of wanting to prevent poverty and wanting to prevent unnecessary drains on the public treasury-undergirded both of these opinions. In Stanton, the Connecticut Supreme Court allowed Eunice Stanton to recover from her ex-husband on behalf of her deceased second husband, Joshua, for the support that Joshua had provided to Eunice's children from her first marriage. Two of Eunice's children had been awarded to her by a custody decree, and the third had fled from her ex-husband because of fears of personal violence. In a discursive opinion that bothered little with citation, the court authorized recovery for the support of the two children covered by the custody decree on the grounds of the unsupported statement that ""\[p\]arents are bound by law to maintain, protect, and educate their legitimate children, during their infancy, or nonage."" The court allowed recovery for support of the third child because "" \[t\]he infant cast on the world must seek protection and safety where it can be found; and where, with more propriety can it apply, than to the next friend, nearest relative, and such as are most interested in its safety and happiness?""*

This is why no amount of reasoning or moral imperative seems to impact the Child Support system. It's why you find male rape victims paying out to their female rapists, it's why you find 'Common law' boyfriends paying child support on their wives children from another marriage, it's why female child molesters and abusers go unquestioned and enabled until it [kills](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mother-says-she-killed-her-three-children-protect-them-abuse-n1264414) or harms the children, [it's why nations have banned paternity tests unless under strict judicial approval](https://www.ibdna.com/paternity-testing-ban-upheld-in-france/): it was always an amoral demand for Men to be enslaved to a Capitalist system by reducing the burden of Capital's failures. Feminist justification for this would only come a century later, by the most privileged female generation in history.

**The Criminalization Of Non-Payment or Resistance**

Eventually new laws were passed as the poor laws continued to fail and be a burden on the State.

>When the colonial poor-relief system broke down in the nineteenth century, however, reformers started to look for ways other than the poor laws to force fathers to support their children. In the 1870s and 1880s,many states passed desertion and nonsupport statutes that criminalized refusal to support one's children. **These statutes added the punitive power of the criminal law to the dependency focus of the civil child support obligation, punishing those fathers who caused single mothers and children to become dependent on state aid.** The statutes also showcased the fiscally conservative aspect of child support in the nineteenth century: **They were intended primarily as a way to save public resources, not as measures intended to enhance child welfare.**

Let's be real, a lot of children were abused in this system. Child Support and Alimony are Anti-Socialist, Anti-Welfare first, Capitalist second, poor families a distant third, Father's welfare never.

>*""The new laws, like the poor laws, were only triggered by absolute destitution. But unlike the poor laws, they allowed for transfers of child support payments to poor single mothers themselves. An 1886 compilation of American statutes noted that eleven states had made it a penal offense for a father to abandon or refuse to support his minor children.'  By enacting these laws, American states made nonpayment of child support a serious crime, punishable by a criminal penalty.""*

A note, this is about the 'American Invention' but it was very quickly being adopted elsewhere, as in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/mpahde/patriarchy_in_1316/gubtf0q?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by /u/problem_redditor.

*Courts interpreted the laws as creating criminal sanctions for those who caused dependency. The aim of the laws was one typically associated with the welfare state-the prevention of dependency. But the form of the laws was based on a criminal justice model-the punishment of offenders against public peace.*

**These early family courts assumed and invented a legal statute of child support and punishment that didn't exist**. This process of calling on sympathy for women at the expense of men, at the expense of the rights and due process of men, on behalf of wealthy concern trolls, became the basis for the future Family Court and it's profiteers.

>*The new nonsupport statutes displayed their criminal, punitive intentions in both their statutory language and the courts' interpretation of them. The early desertion and nonsupport statutes made the criminal nature of the offense clear. The New Jersey statute, enacted in 1884, punished nonsupporting fathers with imprisonment and hard labor ""in the same manner as other prisoners committed to such jail or workhouse are put and kept at hard labor."" The typical criminal penalties imposed for nonsupport were fines,14 imprisonment,"" or both.""' Some laws provided for the suspension of the sentence if the father could provide a bond for the future support of his wife and child. The legislatures that drafted nonsupport statutes were following the prevailing cultural paradigm for understanding child support: Professional charity workers during this period repeatedly used the language of punishment to describe how they dealt with deserting or nonsupporting husbands.'* 

This was the beginning of the professional charitable organization, with the apparent goal of making the world a worse place. Punishing poor men for being poor and demanding that men slave for the profit of others and without rights of parenthood or respect for upholding the social safety net of society. Meanwhile employers remained free to debase the value of labor such that single mothers couldn't afford to raise children in the new industrial cities. This industry is now dominated by Feminist women maintaining the old status quo of profiting off of State funding with elite capture, helping only women to avoid the horrors of capitalism, and punishing and blaming Men for causing expensive public burden. The only difference is that the rhetoric is now bound up in gender ideology and concerns the innate evil of Men and innate victimhood of Women. All of which has been found repeatedly to be false.

>*""Courts justified the criminal nature of the new statutes by asserting-as had the courts inventing the common-law support obligation that a nonsupporting husband violated his duty to the public to keep his wife and children from going on poor-relief. ""*  
>  
>  
>  
>*""...The idea that desertion and nonsupport statutes punished an offender for his role in causing dependency on the state was vigorously asserted by courts interpreting the new laws. In these decisions, courts tied the dependency and punishment rationales together, completing the move to the modem American way of thinking about child support. ""*

By the way, the exact same thing is happening with Alimony at the same time. But the focus of the author is on Child Support. Ultimately both would be considered a 'natural duty' to be viewed and treated as criminal if disobeyed or through non-payment.

**The Use Of Poor Law Logic, Child Support Obligations To Reinstate Slavery**

>*The child support system that developed in American courts in the nineteenth century was open only to white families. Under slavery, almost no blacks in either the Northern states that permitted slavery or in the South were permitted to marry.*  
>  
>*""Even legally sanctioned marriages did not give black fathers either the right to direct the upbringing of their children or the duty to support them.* ***Soon after the Civil War, most Southern states passed ""apprenticeship"" statutes as part of the Black Codes. These statutes allowed whites to indenture black children, regardless of whether the children lived with their families or whether their parents were working to support them.*** ***The statutes essentially reintroduced slavery for black children. As a result, black men in the period after the Civil War were only under legal child support obligations when their children could not be successfully indentured.""***

I can't state this enough, the historical and present child support, alimony, and male-disposability industry at large are a creation of a capitalist slavery society, specifically with the goal of forcing Men to subsidize capitalist exploitation and reduce burden on the State and the Wealthy. It is a horrific fact that the labor left has ignored or scoffed at the idea of child support or alimony as indentured servitude, and at the role of Feminism in expanding it, but the historical facts line up to make it very clear that that's what it was intended to be. **This system is the reason we don't have a real social safety net for Children, as well as the reason Men are blamed by default, it's more profitable and socially acceptable this way.**

As a result of the unofficial nature of black marriages in the late nineteenth century, prosecutions against black fathers occurred under the 'bastardly' or illegitimacy statutes. ""designed to compel a putative father to support his out-of-wedlock children"".

Many black families of this time survived these systems by boarding with each other, often taking in children for long periods of time.

# Powerful Takeway : 

These 'Feminist' Laws were written by conservatives. The pro-female bias even today is carried out by a majority conservative judicial body. ""Feminism"" as a movement is historically a consequence of this bias and privilege, taken to further extremes of course but still originating in 19th century america.  This is why 'gynocentrism' or male disposability is a much more accurate view of female institutional privileges than the rise of second wave feminism a century later. Feminists absolutely made it worse and even expanded it in new ways in the20th century, (such as in the new Domestic Abuse industry), but I've seen this take many times on MensRights that Feminists invented and created this system. They did not. They're the byproduct of it.

**Earnings and Costs Of Living For Families And Single Mothers**

This video showing the expenses of a Family in 1860 cites an average 12$ of weekly income, and breaks down the expenses of an average family that would have a windfall of 5.72$ a month. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL0QEzubKVc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL0QEzubKVc)

In many ways they had it much better than we do, before the financialization and speculation of rents and housing, as well as increasing population size, housing was relatively cheap and things like machinery, medicine or tools were very expensive. 

However a poor single mother made much less.

During this time, women frequently made [significantly less money in low-skilled, industrial labor positions](http://www.choosingvoluntarysimplicity.com/what-did-people-earn-in-1860/).

Box maker (boys) — $3.50

Box maker (men) — $11.20

Box maker (women and girls) — $5.71

Cigar maker (men) — $12.00

Cigar maker (women) — $7.50

Printer (men) — $11.00

Printer (women) — $4.00

Spinner (girls) — $2.37

Spinner (men) — $8.00

Spinner (women) — $4.00

Weaver (men) — $7.50

Weaver (women) — $5.25

Many people at this time were boarders and lived in large households, but taking in again the length of time you now have to raise children before they can work - it was clear that Child Support and Alimony had to be increased. Just as in today, many poor men could not pay.

It's not hard to see that an uneducated single mother would struggle, although in terms of cost of living she would actually struggle less in a city than in 2021 where the cost of rent would likely exceed her monthly income. A working class man in 2021 paying her child support, not even mentioning alimony, would likely be homeless or living with parents, priced out of independence while supporting a woman who is on average more educated than he is.

At this time Cornelius Vanderbilt was worth 105$ million and the top 5% made 4,605/year on average.

According to this paper, women in this period were receiving 2-5 dollars a week, moving many of these women up the ladder toward the average income and moving some of these Men below where the women were before. The poorest Men of course, were jailed for nonpayment and sentenced to hard labor.

The economy is built on exploiting Men and our rights follow. Men work the worst jobs, suffer the worst injuries, have the least education, less hope in a future, make up the bulk of poorest americans and homeless - all while Men are keeping women alive in an increasing cruel economy. Without any rights in relationships, parenthood, or as victims of abuse. Because of the dependency-punishment model, Men receive no respect or status for working for women and children, they are treated like criminals while Capitalists extract so much wealth that it's no longer possible for working class people to afford children without two working parents or child support and alimony (which puts a working class person into destitution or prison).

**The shift to maternal preference for child custody, and judicial bias for women**

>The earliest American custody decisions were made according to the traditional English rule of paternal preference. Mothers almost never won custody of their children in divorce cases from the colonial era to the early nineteenth century. Beginning in the first third of the nineteenth century, however, the strict paternal preference rule began to erode.  
>  
>Child Support society in general became preoccupied with the ""cult of motherhood,"" and this cultural construct influenced judges making custody decisions as they became increasingly likely to award custody of the newly valued children to the mother. By the 1850s, the trend toward maternal preference was well-established,4 and by the end of the century, the custody of children after a divorce was almost always awarded to the mother. 

**Present, The Post New-Deal Return To Poor Laws and anti-Welfare**

>*President Clinton hailed the possibility that child support enforcement might shrink welfare rolls. ""If every parent paid the child support they should,"" he said at the news conference following the signing of the bill, ""we could move 800,000 women and children off welfare immediately."" At the parallel Republican press conference, Representative Jennifer Dunn pointed out that nonpayment of child support was a major cause of welfare dependency. Reminding her audience that over thirty billion dollars in court-ordered child support payments goes uncollected, she asked: ""What happens when that money is not paid? The children and the mother go on welfare. And so the taxpayer becomes in effect the parent of those children.""*  
>  
>*The villain in the child support reform story is the ""deadbeat dad"" who does not pay child support. In a speech in Denver one week before he signed the welfare bill, President Clinton assured his audience that nonpayment of child support was a serious crime, comparing it to robbing a bank or a 7-Eleven store. In a final cascade of warnings to ""deadbeat dads,"" the President said: ""I\[I\]f you owe child support, you better pay it. If you deliberately refuse to pay it, you can find your face posted in the Post Office. We'll track you down with computers ... We'll track you down with law enforcement. We'll find you through the Internet.""* 

In other words: nothing has changed. In fact, [criminalization has run rampant because of Feminist lobbying](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/hcp1h4/overview_of_feminist_studies_on_the_responsbility/). New attitudes about gender and equality have done almost nothing to oppose the sexist laws of a pro-slavery, elitist society. The greatest 'win' is that a very small amount of wealthy women pay child support or alimony, but that industry is so evil, driven by greed that having 'equality' in destroying our relationships to feed capitalism isn't a win to me.

The author concludes with his view that a welfare system for children should be established. 

>*The historical account of the origins of the American child support duty in concerns about dependency and punishment allows for at least a tentative sketch of a historical argument to explain why America in the early twentieth century did not enact a system of child benefits or family allowances...*  
>  
> *...This system of private child support transfers and a lack of public supports for raising children remains with us today, as concerns about dependency and punishment continue to dominate the modem American child support system.* 

Despite historical court records that explicitly detail the beginnings of Child Support and Alimony as a means to cut social spending, destroy welfare, and thereby hold back a need for socialist policies by pressing Men into peonage - this concept receives almost no recognition, and even more alarmingly no recognition at all from people who call themselves socialists, pro-labor, or advocates of the working class. It's not unfair at all to say that anyone who refuses to criticize this system is an authoritarian capitalist. 

There are a lot of solutions. The problem isn't solutions. The problem is that while these monsters have no problem using generations of Men as slaves and then as debt slaves (peonage), they cry and shrink back at the idea of contributing to society with public spending.

Here's my idea: Because Child Support primarily ends up paying off landlords, if instead of punishing Men we had developed publicly owned housing such as in Singapore (but on an American scale) - there would be much less of a problem. They could be either free or low cost, and they also could solve domestic abuse situations where someone needs a place to stay as well as Child Support by freeing the parent of the biggest cost of living. In a place where the parent can't even fully pay rent in Seattle, SF, New York this is a huge win. We could've also been rid of our horrific homelessness problem which primarily affects Men, we could've avoided inflicting poor children with a sense of precariousness that leads to late life consequences. With housing, single Moms or Dads could easily afford to support and spend time with their children. Most importantly, with this policy in place there will be no need to create a Feminist style big budget program that will 99% benefit women and be paid for by Men. There will be no social workers, therapists, lawyers, or other forms of elite capture. You build, you give away to poor families. The abundance of free housing ends the speculative real estate bubble. Life gets better for everyone.

I'm sure there are other solutions too, but as I said, the problem is never solutions. The problem is class of people who don't want solutions because then they wouldn't have gold houses, or a media job complaining about Men, or a charity organization that can't or doesn't want to fix anything.  


There is now a full multi-billion dollar industry (33 Billion due in Child Support in 2015 alone) that has formalized abusing Men and Children for the benefit of fiscal conservatism and more recently, Feminist directed greed and privilege. The paradigm has also changed to a society that does have public spending, but uses it to set up patronage systems for Feminists at the expense of victims (VAWA, Title IX). In this model, Men pay the most taxes, receive the most punishments, the least rights, have access to the least services, and have the most problems. Using an academic industry funded in the same way, they create a body of cherry-picked research (1 in 4 homeless are women!) to justify the acts of a for-profit, anti-welfare charity industry. This new feminist industry effectively acts as elite capture and conservative, anti-socialist deficit hawking. [Recently the TimesUp MeToo charity was found to have spent most of it's money on itself](https://nypost.com/2020/11/28/star-studded-times-up-charities-spent-big-on-salaries-not-victims/).

The Bar association, one of the largest lobbying groups in the country, and family law has become a for-profit beast that no-one consented to. You are \*required\* to lawyer up at an average cost of 10-12K (Most americans have less than 1K in the bank at any given time), otherwise you'll be crushed by the opposing legal team.  [The judge makes 160,000$ a year rubberstamping restraining orders while having the same level of gender bias as the average idiot.](https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/640610) This industry is for-profit, nonconsensual, and built on the backs of Men, and brutalizes children. The family court is the little saint james island of legal abuses. And now because of this history we realize that this court never had a legitimate basis for operating, merely a slavery-era elite justification that it was our 'natural duty' to help Capitalists destroy our prosperity and our families.

This industry has also expanded from the Family Court to control other aspects of our lives. Erin Pizzey wrote a book on her experience creating the first Domestic Abuse Shelters and watching them become a corrupt, anti-male, multi-billion dollar industry with little interest in using that money to actually help victims. In the US private charities have millionaire CEOs directing funding for 'women only' programs that the wealthy can donate to in order to avoid paying for public spending. These professional parasites lobby to shut down homeless shelters, support, and rights for Men.

There is also a for-profit global industry in the form of feminist NGOs who enter countries under imperialist economic relations, to 'save' women, in order to help justify imperialism while claiming to fight it's effects in hurting women. Elizabeth Bernstein explored this subject in Militarized Humanism Meets Carceral Feminism, where Feminists allied with Evangelical Christian NGOs in an fabricated fight to end 'sex trafficking' that required international cooperation to punish Men - not only did they not find the epidemic they were looking for, these NGOs routinely ignore the economic conditions that necessitate prostitution.

One of the most important things that has been discovered about this industry is the enormous [impact of fatherlessness on children](https://fathers.com/statistics-and-research/the-consequences-of-fatherlessness/), with fatherless children being more likely to become involved in crime, homelessness, suicide, child abuse, and many other factors that are worse than poor children with two parents.

537,mvf1hw,2021-04-21,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,How did Women and Men both working become an ideal,"There is so much push these days to get Women in the workforce. A crazy amount of push. My country, Canada, is working towards Universal Childcare to enact that. But what Universal Childcare do? All it does it incentivize kids to be kept away from parents so that Mothers and Fathers can both serve their corproate overlords.

Women entering the workforce has lowered real wages in half. Basic supply and demand really. You used to need one income. Now you need two. Everyone is stuck serving the corproate overlord AND doing housework. While kids are denied parental time and are institutionalized younger and younger.

How is this a good thing? The Male provider role sucks. I hate it. But a fair system would have worked towards socializing people so that Men can marry up as easily as Women could. Or half the workweek so everyone could work and take care of kids and split that in an equitable manner. Not make everyone slave away full time for their corporate overlords. How are people not seeing this? And those that do acknowledge that real wages have gone down as a result see it as a net benefit that Women too have the ability to be corporate drones.",TC18271851,t2_ax388u38,0.91,144,105
538,fu98ba,2020-04-03,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,"""The male corporate model is built on a man’s greater willingness to be a slave of sorts–especially once he has to provide for children.""","Corporate exploitation effects both genders, but I think men are uniquely effected due to the providership role that is commonly forced on them.

Early socialists realized this as far back as the 1800s, and saw socialism, in part, as being necessary to ""equalize the genders"" (at least as far as labor was concerned). Socialism was a worker's movement, and most workers were men who slaved away 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, to provide a meager existence for their wife and kids.

Companies have the power to use and abuse their workers because they are stuck earning money not just for themselves, but for other people as well.

Nowadays single moms are also effected, since the largest factor is providing for children.  Most women work and most women can support themselves.  But raising a child is not cheap.

Fortunately, we do have welfare programs and housing assistance for women and children (however inadequate they may be).  But there's virtually no assistance available for a working man to help provide for his family.  And without anything to fall back on, men work perpetually harder jobs and longer hours in an effort to try and keep themselves afloat.  This is true even for single fathers.

Socialization causes men to essentially work themselves to death. And this is what the corporate model is based on.  It's not just about blind consumerism.  It is a necessary step that most men take if they want to get married or have kids.

* I am on a few Discord servers associated with content creators who fit the description above.  While I do not find anything wrong with the creators' own views, their content seems to attract a number of people from the opposite end of the political spectrum.
* As a more specific example, take Bret Weinstein.  I have not gone through everything he has ever said publicly, but he seems like a decent guy overall.  When I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIcV3rmk9hM), I was first afraid to watch it because I thought he might come out as an anti-vaxxer or something.  Turns out this was not the case at all for him, but the comments section is full of them.  In his case, I'm not quite sure if he is so unhappy about the applause from the other team.  I mean, he says he wants to talk to everybody, but he could do a better job at clarifying his own political stance.  On a similar note, I don't like how he builds some kind of group identity around the IDW.
* Finally, let's talk about James Lindsay (co-auther of ""Cynical Theories"").  First of all, I did not find [his point on why he would vote for Trump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtr163cI10Q) very convincing, but I would have believed him if he did not [have something going with Michael O'Fallon](https://twitter.com/etvpod/status/1292144346704293892), who, if you check his Twitter feed, is at least very defensive about Trump.  Apart from that, Pluckrose and Lindsay seem to be pulling [quite a few strawmen](https://www.liberalcurrents.com/the-cynical-theorists-behind-cynical-theories/) in their book, so even though I agree with the idea behind it, it is probably not doing a very good service.

So, just like feminism is eating the Left, my unfortunate observation is that anti-feminism, even by those who at least declare themselves left-leaning, is getting eaten by the Right.  I am not sure if this is deliberate infiltration or if they think they are hearing dog whistles from our side, but either way, it is not a good alliance.

This does not mean that you should not listen to people who come from a different political standpoint – it's not like what they say is automatically wrong, so I like to hear their ideas, but even if we have a few things in common, I will *not* join forces with them for a common cause, as I cannot ignore that their motivations are usually very different from mine.

I can understand that many people from the Left are very frustrated with the current situation and quickly connect to anybody who is outside the ""mainstream"", but this is a very negative way of thinking.

Greetings American Psychological Association! My name is Shawn Smith. I’m a clinical psychologist in Denver, Colorado. I’ve spoken to you before. You might remember my critique of your guidelines for working with boys and men.

Incidentally, you never responded to my invitation to discuss those guidelines. I’m not going to lie, that hurt. But I can’t stay mad at you, APA. You’re so darned cute when you play hard-to-get. So today, I’m going to take a different approach. I’m not going to yell at you about methodology or challenge you to a debate. I’m going to be nice, for the most part, and see if we can find some common ground about better serving our clients. *I’m going to make you love me.*

So, let’s get down to business. Our profession has been consumed by a dogmatic ideology, and it’s creating serious ethical problems out here on the front lines. You, the leadership of the APA, are in a unique position to get our profession back on track, and today I’m hoping to persuade at least some of you to try.

This problem of ideology in our profession is not new. I was speaking up about it a decade ago when I saw social psychologists producing passive-aggressive, low-rent studies claiming that conservatives are mentally inferior to liberals.

Those papers were really just editorials masquerading as research, and they were a symptom of a much larger problem that plenty of people were already aware of.

For example, this 2012 study uncovered open hostility against conservatives within our own ranks. Back then, conservative psychologists – both of them – were afraid to reveal their political leanings because doing so might harm their careers, and they were right to be anxious. Their liberal colleagues openly admitted that they would discriminate against them because of their political beliefs. In fact, the more liberal the respondents were, the more enthusiastically they said they would mistreat their conservative colleagues...... see link for rest",mhandanna,t2_6ag9b21g,0.95,41,61

Oftentimes people who criticize feminists are accused of zero-sum thinking. But isn't that the same thing as what the feminists in academia and the media are doing by characterizing us as misogynists for promoting open discussion about men's issues?

I have not met a single mainstream feminist who is interested in an open and honest dialogue about sex and gender. It's always ""Rah rah rah you're an incel"" or ""You're against women's rights"" 

It can be a major exercise in futility to convince someone that caring about boys and men isn't the same as hating women.

[Techtonica](https://techtonica.org/) is an educational program discriminating on the basis of sex and gender. Their sponsor company, SocialGood, has received federal financial assistance (DUNS 070492128). This means that the program will be subject to Title IX. They have 30+ employees on LinkedIn, all of them are women/female/femme presenting. As they have 15+ employees, EEOC will apply.

Companies sponsor students in this program and pipeline them into hiring. This is an EEOC violation, whereby the sponsors allow another company (Techtonica) do the discriminating for them. This is also a Title IX violation if the companies also receive federal financial assistance. Many of them do. Title IX covers programs run by third parties (Techtonica) if the institution that is providing assistance in any way (this could be funding, it could be space in a room) receives federal financial assistance. Below is a list of companies involved (listed on Techtonica's home page) that have received federal funds, along with ID's corresponding to their DUNS or specific contracts. I have done my best to make sure the funding info is correctly associated to the company, in some cases it might be the parent companies funding that I listed.

Establishing jurisdiction.

* They must be discriminating on the basis of a protected group, in this case sex and gender.
* You must show they, or a company that has helped them, has received federal funds.
* This must be an educational program. [Title IX does not just apply to a traditional school](https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-ix).

>Title IX applies to all aspects of education programs or activities operated by recipients of federal financial assistance.[1](https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-ix#1) In addition to educational institutions such as colleges, universities, and elementary and secondary schools, Title IX also applies to any education or training program operated by a recipient of federal financial assistance. For example, Title IX would cover such diverse activities as a forestry workshop run by a state park receiving funds from the Department of Interior; a boater education program sponsored by a county parks and recreation department receiving funding from the Coast Guard; a local course concerning how to start a small business, sponsored by the state department of labor that receives funding from the Small Business Administration; state and local courses funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in planning how to deal with disasters; and vocational training for inmates in prisons receiving assistance from the Department of Justice (hereinafter referred to as ""DOJ"" or ""Justice Department"" or ""the Department""). Generally, it covers all aspects of the education program, including admissions, treatment of participants, and employment. Title IX guarantees equal educational opportunity in federally funded programs.

Description of the program, bold is mine:

>After the first trial month of full-time training, participants who work the hardest and meet and exceed expectations will be invited to continue for the next five months of training with stipends based upon need and funding available.\[...\]  
>  
>Upon successful completion of the program, some participants will be placed with available partner companies via a two-way interview and rating system. As of the open of the January 2021 applications, we have seven positions for placement and will be accepting 10-15 participants. If you are placed with a company and you both meet the requirements, you may earn an OJT (""On-the-Job Training"") **certificate from the State of California's Division of Apprenticeship Standards**.

Their first eligibility requirement to enroll is if:

>you are a woman (cis OR trans) or non-binary adult.

Description for sponsoring:

>By sponsoring, you're empowering the people most underrepresented in tech and most in need. You’ll also save time and money on recruiting, build diversity in tech, expand your network, gain new perspectives, make better products, receive a tax exemption, join other distinguished supporters, and lift the local community.

Techtonica's code of conduct allows racism and sexism explicitly.

>\[...\] will not act on complaints regarding:

A couple days ago I filed a Title IX and EEOC complaint against Techtonica / SocialGood and listed all these companies as being in violation. If anyone feels they would benefit from this program and meets the criteria except for gender, you should apply. You don't have to be apathetic and just complain that this sucks. You might be able to do something about it. If you are rejected you would be able to file a Title IX / EEOC complaint that would add context to this. There have been some bellwethers that OCR is willing to take action on these kinds of things now.

It's easier to file complaints than you think. There is a pdf form you fill out. The description boxes are small so just say ""see email"" then be clear what boxes you are answering in the email. Send it along with as much documentation as humanly possible attached to the email. You can amend and update your assigned case manager if things develop more.

I have been working with OCR on some cases I filed and it's been a better experience than I thought it would be.

You don't have to tolerate this stuff. 

Edit: This case cost me nothing but time and mental/emotional energy. It should be staying that way, that's how it is supposed to work filing with OCR.

544,k0giys,2020-11-24,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,"I took today off from work and turned into a ""house husband"". And I would switch roles permanently if I could.","I wasn't planning on doing anything in particular today. I just wanted a day off and figured that around the holidays was a good time to do that.

What I ended up doing was cleaning the house though.  Top to bottom with chemicals - bleach, floor shine, windex, counter cleaner...  There's not an inch of this house that I didn't touch today.  

I also cooked.  All three meals for me, my girlfriend (who works from home), and our kids.

And you know what I realized?

I would do the same thing every single day of my life if it meant I'd never have to work again. No more commuting.  No more worrying about money, fighting for promotions, stress about layoffs, or having to kiss ass every day.

Now I'm not saying it was easy.  In fact I think I'm about as tired as I would be coming home from work.  But I'm strangely energized if that makes sense.  I just feel better.  (Plus, for the sake of argument, you don't do cleaning like that every day).

Anyway my point is that men definitely get the short end of the stick with this work vs cleaning stuff.  It's completely unfair. Not just because women get the better end of the deal. But also because society won't admit to this and instead looks down on men and the work we typically do for the family.

If women don't want to do housework then that's fine.  Get a job.  A real job that requires real work and pays enough to cover the bills and not just your spending money.  And then leave me home.  I'll make that sacrifice.  I'll take a bullet for the team.  And you'd better be appreciative of me even if I don't appreciate you going to work and paying the bills.  And when you get home, I get to boss you around and make you do whatever housework I decided I didn't want to do that day.  Not to mention the yard work, running errands on the way home, fixing things, and everything else that doesn't entail ""cooking and cleaning"".

Because that's the world that men live in.  And it sucks.  It's not a privilege to leave your house and work all day only to get nagged and hassled when you get home.  It's not a privilege to bust your butt every single day but have all of that ignored because your wife or girlfriend cleaned that day and is ""tired"".

Granted me and my girlfriend both work and we both regularly split chores.  Not a whole lot of people live in traditionalist households anymore.  But a lot of couples tend to split their responsibilities in that direction. With men working more (or at harder jobs) and women cleaning more.  

I'd definitely do it though. So long as I was the one who got to stay home.",Oncefa2,t2_15it3r,0.94,70,21
545,13numk1,2023-05-21,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,"The ""male housework list"" or ""honey do list"" (the second shift) | Sources from Dr. Warren Farrell","Warren Farrell's male housework list came up here a couple months ago, so I figured I would transcribe it in full.

It comes from the book *Women Can't Hear What Men Don't Say*. It's a relationship book about communication strategies that tackles a lot of the issues that come up in some of these gender discussions.

The author is a well known feminist and men's rights advocate who spent decades working as a professional marriage counselor.

One of the premises of the book is that marital conflict often comes from ""political"" messages in society that people internalise.  A lot of which is the kind of stuff you hear from feminists pretty regularly today. Like the idea that women do all the work at home (they don't) and are unappreciated by men (which isn't true).  Or the idea that they're being exploited and treated like slaves because they don't get paid (they obviously live off their husband's money).

Of course if you're a woman and you believe that, you might start harbouring resentment against your husband!

Farrell gives the example of ads saying things like *""when was the last time your husband cooked?""*. And says that men might harbour resentment against their wives if ads instead said things like, *""when was the last time your wife helped you clean the gutters?""*.

Men often don't notice what they do for their families themselves.

One study mentioned by Farrell found that women exaggerate the amount of time they spend doing chores by a factor of 3.

Whereas men *underestimate* their contributions by a full half.

So if a man estimates that he puts in 10 hours a week at home, in reality he's doing 20.

And if a woman estimates she's doing 60, in reality she's only doing 20 as well.

Women of course do a lot at home.  On average they spend more time doing housework and taking care of children than men. But that is changing now that more and more women work full-time.

When you include paid labor, men actually do more work than women across the board.  That includes stay at home situations, and full-time working couples.  Data going back to the 1960s has shown that this is relatively constant across time, and between different countries.

Many of these studies come to these conclusions despite exaggerating female tasks and downplaying male tasks (which is sometimes done *intentionally*).  This is one of the reasons Farrell made his list in the first place.  He compares it against a different list used by the radical feminist Arlie Hochschild in her book *The Second Shift* where she tries to cherry pick government data to prove that women effectively work two jobs, while men only work one.

But the reality is a man's contributions to his family don't stop at the workplace.  There's an entire second shift that men do every day around (and outside) their homes as well. Women aren't the only ones who do chores for their families.  The only difference is we systematically *ignore* the male side of this.  Many men spend entire weekends, or take days off from work, to get their honey do lists accomplished.  But for some reason, we view all of this very different from how we view housework done by women.

Here is the list that Farrell came up with:

>**WHAT** ***PERCENTAGE*** **OF THE TIME DO YOU VS. YOUR PARTNER DO THESE CHORES?**

>1\. **Activities most likely to break an arm, leg, or neck, or to crack a skull:** In your relationship, who climbs tall ladders or checks out the roof? For example, who uses ladders to do house painting (*e.g*., reaching for a spot we’ve missed that’s too far away on a homemade scaffold on a 
windy day), or to clean outside windows; or to go into the attic? Who shovels wet snow off a roof to avoid roof damage, resulting in many men slipping off the roof every winter? 

>A man who falls off a roof or ladder is lucky if he breaks only an arm; some men, though, are paralyzed for life, or killed; others find shoveling snow off a roof leads to problems that get them classified in one of the 
next two categories.

>2\. **Activities most likely to trigger heart attacks:** Shoveling snow off a driveway or sidewalk; pushing a car that’s out of gas off a crowded street into the gas station; playing tag, soccer, or basketball with the kids for a “little too long” while trying to teach the children that a parent can be a playmate too; or carrying a sleepy child from an upstairs bed to the backseat of a car and back into bed again without waking up the child, only to find Dad’s heartbeat getting erratic and pain thrusting through his arm. 

>3\. **Activities most likely to cause lower back problems and hernia operations:** Moving furniture or twisting his back as he juggles a heavy suitcase into the backseat of a two-door car (or behind other suitcases in a trunk); or trying to carry a IV or a computer up a down staircase; or moving the refrigerator or some file cabinets; or moving tables at a church event or picnic. 

>4\. **Assembly:** Mail-order products, toys, bikes, furniture, bookcases, beds; putting up kids’ plastic pools, backyard tents. 

>5\. **Barbecuing:** Shopping for barbecue, charcoal, propane; basting, marinating, cooking; cleaning up of grill, tongs, ashes, *etc*.

>6\. **Bodyguard: at home** (*e.g.*, who usually checks it out in the middle of the night when you and your partner are awakened by a noise that sounds like someone has just broken into your home, and you know they could have a gun?); **in public places** (who plays bodyguard when nightfall turns a beautiful park into a dangerous park or a quaint side street into a dangerous alley; or when a lonely hiking trail proves to be a rattlesnake haven; or when a ski slope becomes an avalanche?). We've all read stories of a man saving a woman from a burning house or a raging river or a crashed car. Women often save children in these situations—and even lift cars to save children. Although I’ve asked over a million people (on IV and radio) to send me a story of a woman risking her life to save an adult man, so far, no stories. **Every time a woman and man walk together in a public place, he unconsciously serves as an unpaid bodyguard.**

>7\. **Camping:** It starts with taking psychological responsibility for avoiding disaster (checking weather predictions and safety of the location, buying correct tent and camping gear, taking responsibility for not getting lost, knowing how to use a compass, *etc*.), then carrying the primary backpack (often including the stove and a kerosene lamp), erecting the tent, dig¬ ging drainage trenches, gathering firewood, building the fire, hoisting food away from animals. **The man is often the camping home buyer, home mover, and homemaker.**

>8\. **Car buying:** Price negotiation, *Consumer Guide/Blue Book*- type research.

>9\. **Car maintenance and repair:** Checking hoses, belts, tire pressures, vacuuming inside, applying Armor All; comparisons of prices with mechanics, tire changing (see also Emergencies). 

>10\. **Carpentry:** From putting up shelves (in garage, basement, and closets) to repairing loose fence slats, to making bookcases, to building a doghouse.

>11\. **Christmas:** Putting up lights on house and tree; tree purchase, set-up, dismantling and disposal; retrieving boxes of ornaments from dusty attic or storage area. 

>12\. **“Male cleaning”:** Car washing (and waxing); cleaning all painting tools for reuse (brushes, rollers, pans, guides); cleaning out the basement, attic, fireplace and gutters (the darkest, dirtiest, hottest and coldest parts of the house); cleaning filters of air conditioning and heating units; cleaning yard; bathing of dogs; and, if there’s a pool or Jacuzzi. . . . (See also: Barbecuing; Diaper Changing, Male Equivalents of; Guns and Weapons; Activities most likely to break. . . . )

>13\. **Coaching-as-child care:** Baseball (1-Ball, CAP Leagues, Little League), softball (*e.g.*, Bobby Soxers), football (Pop Warner), roller hockey, field hockey, ice hockey, soccer; more informal coaching-as-child care via ""playing together” in basketball, or throwing, catching, and hitting a ball; instructions in individualized sports such as tennis; instructions in self- defense (aikido, boxing, wrestling). 

>14\. **Computer buying:** Researching  best hardware and software; comparing prices, new vs. used markets, *etc*.

>15\. **Confrontations—with neighbors or strangers:** “Go tell the neighbors their dogs barking too loud.” Or, you’ve just gotten into a car accident with a stranger; who approaches the other driver when everyone is emotionally off center?

>16\. **Dead animal disposal:** DAD quickly comes to mean Dead Animal Disposer when the gerbil dies, the rat’s been trapped, when the mouse has been lead into temptation, or when the dog’s been run over and the street has blood all over. What’s worse for some dads, though, is having to kill the almost-dead animal—when DAD means *Dying* Animal Disposer.

>17\. **Decks:** Building, sanding, staining, sealing.

>18\. **Diaper changing, male equivalents of:** Plunging a backed-up toilet; wiping up a child's vomit when carsick on a vacation; cleaning up after dog doo from own dog and neighbors'.

>19\. **Digging:** Holes and ditches, removing of boulders, tree stumps, *etc*.

>20\. **Dinner when company’s visiting:** Meat carving, wine opening, cocktail making (careful guys, most women still do most everything else when company's visiting). 

>21\. **Disciplining of kids:** ""Wait till Daddy comes home.""

>22\. **Dragon-killing—modern version:** Swatting flies, stepping on roaches, squishing spiders—all without a sword (or, for pacifist performers, removing the spider without hurting it!).

>23\. **Driving:** To and from functions that both sexes go to together, especially when conditions are hazardous (*e.g.*, when caught in rush hour in a strange city; when caught in snow on an icy mountain road; when caught in heavy rain, wind, and fog at night, or when in a foreign country), or when both are exhausted or have had a bit too much to drink; on long trips, especially late at night while the family sleeps; or on a motorcycle (have you ever seen a woman on a motorcycle with a man hanging on?). The automobile and motorcycle are the modern-day white horse. Like the man on the white horse, his role involves more accidents; the man on the white horse, though, never had to worry about a DU I citation!

>24\. **Emergency prevention:** *In home* (*e.g.*, noticing and repairing frayed wires, plugs, sockets, smoke detectors); *in car* (putting chains on tires; being certain all the cars' fluids [oil, transmission, anti-freeze] are being changed on schedule, tool kit and flares are adequate, flashlight has batteries, *etc.*); *via nature* (battening down windows, putting sand bags in the trunk before a blizzard, making sure trees aren't creating a hazard to house or people should a storm arise), *on the town* (making sure there’s cash in the wallet and gas in the car).

>25\. **When emergencies arise despite prevention:** Sandbagging; changing a tire on a cold night in the rain on a dangerous part of the road in the bad part of town; taking the walk for five gallons of gas when the car runs out; or risking putting the battery cable on the wrong side of the battery.

>26\. **Post-emergencies:** Roof repair (shingles, holes, leaks, *etc.*); removal of fallen trees and branches; rebuilding and repairing after damage; or arranging for, supervising and helping with rebuilding and repair.

>27\. **Fences:** Building fences from stone or wood, or installing a wire fence.

>28\. **Fire building, wood chopping and carting wood** indoors while not getting the carpet dirty.

>29\. **Garbage:** Real men take out the garbage because, you see, it's in their genes to know how to use the garbage can cover as a shield should anything happen in that journey from the castle to the street. If he takes out the recycled items and the garden waste, it’s just because he wants to protect his turf of being the garbage man (excuse me, waste management engineer).

>30\. **Gas/electric failures:** Resetting clocks and circuit switches; relighting pilot lights; troubleshooting.

>31\. **Gift-giving as a contribution to maintaining the romance:** We often say men aren’t romantic, but we forget that it is men who are more likely to give the flowers she likes; the diamonds with the right 4 Cs (carat size, clarity, cut and color [then he worries about the 5th C—cost]); the earrings with the hypoallergenic studs; the perfume with the scent she prefers; the right-size ring for the correct finger with the right stone and her preferred cut; or to choose a restaurant that fits her definition of romantic, arranging the occasion, taking her there, and paying. Many a man has never had even one of these things done for him by even one woman one time (just as some women have never had a man do their laundry, cook a meal, or even make a cup of tea).

>32\. **Guns and weapon:** Purchase, cleaning, usage, and safety for protecting family from thieves in city and from animals in rural areas.

>33\. **Hanging:** Of heavy pictures, wall hangings, clocks, phones (especially when molly bolts, toggle bolts, or drywall or plastic anchors are necessary)

>34\. **Installation/hook-up:** Of washer, dryer, computer, TV, cables, and antennas.

>35\. **Life insurance:** Purchasing and choice of carrier.

>36\. **Risky investment management** (stocks, joint ventures, rental property): The investments that inspire blame when they fail and induce stress even when they succeed.

>37\. **Opening:** Jars, doors, big boxes, paint cans, windows that are stuck or frozen.

>38\. **Option generating:** In many couples, the man generates the options, the woman generates the rejections. For example, he asks, “Where would you like to go for dinner?” She answers, “Anywhere.” “Chinese?” he offers. “We just had that,” she reminds. “Italian?” “loo heavy.” “How about that new place—what's its name?” he tries. “I hear that's expensive.” When it comes to restaurants and to movies, the man often generates the options and the woman often selects even immediately after she's said, “It makes no difference.” Option-generating often involves having one's ideas rejected, which can be emotionally taxing.

>39\. **Painting:** Inside and outside of the home, and the laying down of masking tape, sheets, and other painting preparation (See also: Male cleaning and Activities most likely to break an arm . . . ).

>40\. **Patio and sidewalk making:** And sealing over cracks, requiring cement mixing, building of frame, making it level, and living with every mistake because it's “laid on concrete.”

>43\. **Poisons, exposure to:** Use of insecticides to spray for ants and roaches; or to spray trees, flowers, garden vegies.

>44\. **Programming:** The VCR (“Honey, before we leave, I can't miss the special on male housework; would you program the VCR?”), or the CD player, the telephone speed dial. 

>45\. **Pumping gas, paying for gas, changing oil:** When there's both a man and woman in the car, I notice men pump the gas about 80 percent of the time in Northeast 8c West Coast urban areas and university towns, and almost 100 percent of the time anywhere else.

>46\. **Reading the business and financial pages:** To get a feel for business trends that may affect career decisions and information related to investment decisions (which may just look like him “goofing off reading the paper” but is the equivalent of a woman reading recipes in *Better Homes & Gardens* or *Family Circle* [still the best selling magazines to women]). On the other hand, guys, the *sports* pages don't count! 

>47\. **Remodeling:** Taking down walls, putting in windows, finishing garage or basement, and, for better men than I, building entire new rooms.

>53\. **Weather guard:** Guarding a woman against exposure to rain, sleet, and snow by forfeiting his jacket to a woman who is cold even when he is also cold; walking between a woman and a street in which cars and trucks might splash water or slush onto their clothes; scraping ice and snow off a car windshield on a freezing morning; dropping the family off at a restaurant or movie when it's pouring, then parking and walking to the restaurant or theater in the rain (especially if no one has an umbrella); warming up the car before the family gets in it; bringing in the newspaper on a rainy morning; salting the driveway, sidewalk, and stairs when the rain has frozen over, so that if anyone falls, he does .‘(See Also: ""Activities most likely to trigger heart attacks” and ""Emergency” categories).

>54\. **Yard work:** Lawn mowing, fertilizing, weeding, clipping, leaf raking, tree trimming, etc.

>So if men do all this, why don't we know about it? In part because instead of complaining, men *offer* to carry the luggage, barbecue, build the shelves, or shop for the stereo. And in part because we perform our roles unconsciously, as with our bodyguard role; it's hard to complain about that of which we're unconscious. Complaining is the shadow side of consciousness. But men were secretly hoping for the lighter side: appreciation and love . . . but someone took the appreciation and love out to the garbage.

546,fuvng7,2020-04-04,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,"Alberta’s young male unemployed rate is at 20%, double the young female rate. I believe legal discrimination under the Employment Equity act is a major factor.","Edit: the link in the middle, the “employment equity act”, can’t work. This is it:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_equity_(Canada)

So a few months ago we saw all those articles about how Alberta has a sudden surge in young male unemployment, at 20%. It’s double for young men than young women, and as the young male unemployment rate suddenly increased, the young female unemployment rate stayed the same:

[link 1](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/men-male-youth-unemployment-jobs-alberta-1.5389303)

[link 2](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-unemployment-male-youth-feels-dire-1.5390778)

I believe legal discrimination under the [Employment Equity Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_equity_(Canada)) is a major factor. Under the act, any federal employer is required by law to discriminate against male applicants in favor of female applicants. This essential means that for entry level jobs, a woman will always be hired over a man.

Took a look at a snapshot of Albertas employment situation, [with official statistics here](https://work.alberta.ca/documents/labour-profile-youth.pdf). Scrolling down you’ll see how men are significantly more likely to to be unemployed, but this one star really jumped out at me- [women are 63% of employed youth with college degrees](https://imgur.com/a/oNd4ndD). That’s nearly a 2:1 ratio, and the sort of jobs that would be hired on a federal level. 

Considering that women are automatically preferred over men for federal hiring, might this explain the significantly higher male unemployment rate in Alberta?",Darkinser,t2_64czd271,0.92,52,8
547,mq28nb,2021-04-13,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,"We live in a capitalist society, and capitalism disproportionately harms men","Some people try to say that we live in a patriarchy, and that we need to acknowledge that the patriarchy uniquely harms women first, and men second.

Many people will disagree and point out that by quite a few metrics, men suffer a lot more than women. So if we do live in a patriarchy, it's not a very good one.  And if anything, this argument contributes to harmful gender norms itself: chivalry (putting women and women's issues in front of men), male disposability, and male invisibility, are all problems that this narrative helps contribute to.

Ignoring this debate though, I think it's equally important to point out that we also live in a capitalist society, and that by most metrics, capitalism harms men more than it does women.

And unlike the patriarchy debate, where these claims are made without evidence, the facts and logic here are pretty straight forward:

* Men make up most of the destitute and homeless.

* Men commit suicide at much higher rates, [often when money issues cause them to come face to face with these realities](https://np.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/ltntet/high_resolution_debate/). Which women are more likely to be spared from due to the so-called ""glass floor"".  Not to mention that we judge men for their ability to provide, but not women.

* [It's more expensive to be a man](http://www.fighting4fair.com/uncategorized/weve-all-heard-of-the-gender-income-gap-but-is-there-an-expense-gap-working-draft/).  Forget the pink tax. Men pay a [relationship tax](https://np.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/guktek/men_may_not_pay_a_pink_tax_but_they_do_pay_a/) and are responsible for financing some of the biggest expenses in life, including rent, a mortgage, and child care expenses.  They pay for themselves, their partners, and for other women through taxation, since women consume more government resources than what they pay back in taxes ([source 1] (https://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/dr2iqa/us_social_security_oasi_and_disability_di_data/), [source 2](https://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/hvqr0g/the_latest_uk_tax_data_are_in_british_women_paid/), [source 3](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Distribution-of-Income-and-Fiscal-Incidence-by-Aziz-Gemmell/1c8cff018bec64646d696b3b18c0d85a743f81f9), [source 4](https://www.side3.no/vitenskap/kvinner-koster-staten-113000-kroner-mer-i-aret-enn-menn-4402331), [source 5](https://www.mm.dk/artikel/kvinder-er-en-underskudsforretning)).

* Men work more than women.  Both in terms of hours, commute time, and difficulty.  [When you combine unpaid labor with paid labor, men still work more than women](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/ft_18-05-01_fathersday_time/).

* Men retire later than women, and start working at a younger age.

* Men have less free time over the course of their lives. And they even spend less time sleeping, napping, and engaging in self-care activities.

* Men go to the doctor less [in large part because they have less time and energy to go](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e003320), thus contributing to health problems.  Something similar is likely at play when it comes to mental health.  When men finally do retire, or otherwise work the same hours as women, they go to the doctor just as much as women do.

* Men have a worse work-life balance. And there's a lot of research showing that your job and commute are important for your happiness.

* Men die more than women under capitalism.  Including at work.  And suffer from worse health outcomes largely due to stress at work, and occupational diseases.

Why?

Because men are judged by their financial success under capitalism.  [Including when it comes to romance, dating, and marriage](https://np.reddit.com/user/TheTinMenBlog/comments/lw0cql/lets_talk_dating_standards/).  Men by and large earn more money than they spend on themselves.  And women by and large spend more money than what they earn through their own labor.

And this isn't a new observation.  Socialists from as far back as the 1800s noticed that men were the ones working to earn money, and women were the ones spending it.  Many theorized that men as a gender were a second proletariat.

>""**The highest development of modern capitalism, as exemplified in the English-speaking countries, has placed man to all intents and purposes, legally under the heel of woman.** So far as the relations of the sexes are concerned, it would be the task of Socialism to emancipate man from this position, if sex-equality be the goal aimed at. The first step on the road towards such equality would necessarily consist in the abolition of modern female privilege.""

https://archive.org/details/legalsubjection00baxgoog

Now some of this is changing.  More and more women are working.  But most relationships still have men as breadwinners.  Around 70% to be exact, and it may even be higher than that when you take out periods of unemployment (when women do become ""breadwinners"", it's usually only temporary).

So go ahead and tell me that the patriarchy disproportionately harms women.

Because as long as men work and die more than women under capitalism, I think it is also fair to say that capitalism affects men more than women.",Oncefa2,t2_15it3r,0.92,68,30

>
>As the pandemic threw many household arrangements out the window, it also opened the door for men to step up to do more hands-on care work. The challenge now is to close the care gap even more. A new report offers an action plan.
>
>In June, countries around the world celebrate Father’s Day—a moment to recognize the 80 percent of men who become fathers in their lifetime.
>
>Fatherhood is one of the most powerful expressions of what it means to be a man. It is also, in most societies, a crucial source of power. It enables men to decide who gets access to resources, who has control over their bodies, and what is deemed important.
>
>In other words, it is the basis of various manifestations of patriarchy: from stories of lineage, religion, and founding fathers, to selection of last names and notions of patriotism.
>
>This system has been built with daily patience in routines at homes, schools, and workplaces: who cooks, who cleans, what is recognized as work that deserves to be paid, and who provides care. The division of responsibilities falls into a binary construction: this is what women do, this is what men do.
>
>This is not accidental. It is the system that sustains men’s power.
>
>In all corners of the world today, women do three to ten times more unpaid care and domestic work than men; they also make up 70 percent of the paid care workforce.
>
>Men benefit greatly from this arrangement. It allows us to devote time and energy to leadership positions in businesses and governments. It enables us to decide the rules of the game, and to change the rules as we play it.
>
>We have built a system where men are often in a position of domination over others, especially women, LGBTQI and non-binary people.
>
>Surprisingly, the pandemic has nibbled away at the edges of this system, at least in the home. A new report from Promundo finds that in the past year, “men have been carrying out more hands-on care work than any time in recent history.”
>
>State of the World’s Fathers finds that, right now, we have a small window of opportunity to foster transformative change. Small because, at the current pace, the report states, the “world is at least 92 years away from achieving equality in unpaid care work between men and women.”
>
>This Father’s Day offers a unique opportunity for reflection. More men are finding a way to regain their own humanity by engaging in domestic work and care work. As men, we need to hold these things together and ask ourselves: are we strong enough to change? Can we find in care the path to redemption from patriarchy?
>
>*Male violence and male care*
>
>Sadly, for millennia, men’s tendency toward violence has been tolerated and disregarded—and our ability to care for others has been discouraged. This situation hurts everyone, including the men and boys who are dehumanized.
>
>In our patriarchal culture, men are allowed to express anger and frustration openly, while discouraged to express emotions or shed tears.
>
>Before the pandemic, the rate of instances of male violence against women, LGBTQI, non-binary people, and children were alarming. But it’s gotten worse, as the lockdowns intensified pressures in the household. UN data from 142 studies in 44 countries point to an alarming increase in men’s violence against women during COVID-19.
>
>It doesn’t have to be this way. Providing care is not a biological trait. The acts of caring, to be cared for, and care for others constitute a central element of what makes us human.
>
>It is a fundamental part of society. We should regard it as a social good that contributes to our social and economic well being; and we should recognize and redistribute care work among all of us, not just women and girls.
>
>*From reflection to action*
>
>The new report offers a way forward with a 7-point action plan for achieving equality in care work.
>
>Oxfam joins the call for men to use their privilege and power to change as individuals, to defy outdated, harmful laws, and to create a culture that values and respects care.
>
>- Establish national care policies that recognize, reduce, and redistribute care work equally between men and women.
Provide equal, job-protected, fully paid parental leave for all parents as a national policy.
>
>- Design and expand social protection programs to redistribute care equally between women and men, while keeping a focus on the needs and rights of women and girls.
>- Transform health sector institutions to promote fathers’ involvement—from the prenatal period through birth and childhood—and to encourage men as caregivers.
>- Promote an ethic of male care in social norms, through schools, media, and other key institutions.
>- Change workplace conditions, culture, and policies to support workers’ caregiving—and mandate those changes in national legislation.
>- Hold male political leaders accountable for their support of care policies, while advocating for women’s equality in political leadership.

Instead, we have a situation where everyone is working and kids getting neglected. Halving the workweek would once again allow a 40 hour workweek to support a family.

551,t31ot8,2022-02-28,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Can male overrepresentation in violent crime/CEOs of companies be best explained by sexual selection?,"It is a criticism levelled at 'men' (not a monolithic group as well know) that men commit more violent crime and men dominate the CEO positions etc. The feminist explanation has been, roughly, men are just more violent and men oppressed women so only men run Fortune 500 companies. However, could it not just be explained by sexual selection? Women prefer men with resources ie money. I would put it out to you that women assign much more importance to how much money a partner makes that men do. If straight men see this situation, naturally they go out and intend to make lots of money to attract women. Women don't have this motivation. Therefore, men will always be the top earners or commit more violent crime to get money if they can't do it legally.

The solution is no solution-we can't change women. But could we not at least put this theory out there as a counter explanation???",rochesterslim,t2_1wxwl0d3,0.86,29,17

553,mil0u9,2021-04-02,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,The fact that MGM exists is proof that our society is not “advanced”.,"I apologize if my post is America-centric (because I know FGM is an issue in other parts of the world) but my post is like this to help dispel the overly-idealized global views on American society.

Many people, and Americans especially, like to think of capitalism as the highest order of society, “as the best system that works with human nature”, and that alternatives, such as socialism and communism can NEVER work for whatever reason. (Never mind that they’re brainwashed into dismissing alternatives through an aggressive propaganda campaign). Personally, I can *never* forgive capitalism for giving an incentive for MGM to continue so that hospitals can make profits selling to face-cream companies. Not only economics, but society’s blatant misandry (double standards on genital mutilation, seeing men as laborers that should never have emotions, inherent distrust, etc.) betrays the notion of an advanced, free society.

Those in developed countries like to think of their societies as “modern” (and I’m sure medieval and slave societies thought/think the very same thing) with superior technology as a major justification.  However, the physical proof I bear will be a reminder that if it’s possible for a different system to exist (though I’d rather we all go extinct), then it should.",EstrangedNeko,t2_2jjfpm2a,0.85,27,14
554,pkas3i,2021-09-08,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Left Wing Male Dating Advice - That actually works,"If you're anything like me you've seen a lot of posts on this subreddit and probably a few others about male dating and how it tends not to be the most fun thing for men and how it can be hard to be successful.  A lot of men thus look desperately for advice that can help them so they can get rid of the stigma of being single/ a virgin and also hopefully find validation.

Most dating advice geared towards men tends to be more right leaning in nature, in the form of red pillers and pick up artists, than left leaning and there's a very simple reason as to why; they actually tend to make more of an effort. Left wing/ progressive male dating advice generally regurgitates nice sounding platitudes such as ""just be yourself"", ""there's plenty of fish in the sea so don't worry about rejection"" whilst offering only the barest of useful advice. Pick up artists offer quite a bit more even if said objectifies women. Not to mention that red pillers and PUAs typically are more sympathetic to men and male sexuality whilst the left generally frowns upon or even demonizes these things.

There's actually a great video that I found that covers the problem of male dating and why the left wing typically doesn't help when it comes to providing insecure men with answers and how they fall down the red pill rabbit hole. I'll leave a link to it at the bottom.

So I'd like to use this as a post to try and put together a guide on dating for men that isn't steeped in PUA and red pill ideology but doesn't repeat tired old platitudes and actually offers useful advice.

On the other hand I get the impression many young men get hit with what one would call ''I am not shit'' or ''personal failure'' syndrome, while you may think this is another roundabout way of saying ''imposter syndrome'', ''imposter syndrome'' focuses on how you came about to be with those goals or accomplishments, where as the former ''I am not shit'' or ''personal failure'' syndrome is that feeling of feeling you haven't really accomplished much at all in a given time window, especially in terms of career and work goals

&#x200B;

and so, as men we really **REALLY** have to work hard to earn the respect of our mentors around us, I don't mean respect as in decency, I mean respect as in **honor**. While I am not implying women don't, feminism will always back up the credentials of the average woman, especially nowadays in this day and age of abundance. On the other hand your average man is always asked ''what do you have to show off for? Are you making money? Are you in a thriving relationship? Did you get your latest advancement at work?''

&#x200B;

**If mentioning MGTOW is ok and not penalized, then I do wanna say unironically discovering MGTOW back in my middle and high school days is what actually helped me realize that ''This life, I am what I make out of it, not society'' and it ever since it has worked, while I have distanced myself from the MGTOW sphere for awhile lately because of how radicalized their content has gone, self-actualization was really one of their most brought-up often talking points, it really was**

&#x200B;

Now, with that being said, how do we help more men, young men in particular encapsulate the psychological philosophy of self-actualization into their heads and make them realize ''Life is more than just a stupid chamber to build a portfolio for others, ya know?'' it seems like no matter how much men get accomplished, there is just always that kicked-in mental urge to want to demonstrate competence, confidence and action to others, and this gets reinforced and recirculated by family, schools and even entry-level jobs like retail or fast food. God forbid men actually feel a sense of fulfillment and enrichment from their endeavors. Even when a lot of guys do hobbies for themselves, they still try to get all encyclopedic and boastful about it ''Oh hey guys look at me, my tuned Honda Civic/JJ black belt/side hustle/Fortnite trophy'', but why? Some say is men's natural competitive instincts, sure obviously men to some extent do have a bit of an innate desire to outshine others, but let's not act society doesn't weaponize and exacerbate  the problem, especially with the advent of social media and ''excellence'' culture

&#x200B;

You even see it reinforced with motivational content towards men vs that of women, in that men's motivational videos are always barkish, very upfront and right-in-your-face, women's motivational videos are always 100% posititve, yes I understand this is a matter moreso of social media algorithms, but still you can see the dressing right in the window

&#x200B;

So with all that out of the way, how do we make more men realize their worth is more than just trying to build a stupid portfolio for others and society at large and encourage more young men to practice ''self-actualization''?

Men are encouraged to work longer hours at harder jobs because they know it's necessary if they want a girlfriend or a wife.  This results in worse health outcomes, a shorter life expectancy, higher stress levels, and an overall worse quality of life.

But this isn't just an issue that negatively effects men.   Two of the biggest effects of hypergamy should be pretty obvious: the wage gap, and the child care gap.

Besides just effecting the choices that women make in their careers (by prioritizing a high earning husband over a high earning job), it also effects tangential issues like women not being taken as seriously in the workplace. 

Because men work longer hours and at harder jobs, they earn more money than women.  But they also have less time and energy at home to take care of their children and do the cooking and cleaning.

Addressing hypergamy would therefore not just help men but also women.",Oncefa2,t2_15it3r,0.86,40,20

What was unexpectedly found was just how large of a gap exists between men and women.

They were looking at how many callbacks a prospective job candidate received after an interview. The percents for different categories of candidate are presented below.

The researchers sent out batches of identical resumes to various companies, but with personal changes- children, marriage, gender etc. the difference between the male and female candidates is MASSIVE, and Austria has the biggest gap of all. 

[this is the data for part time work](https://imgur.com/a/t6z8YOq)

Women received callbacks 19.22% of the time, or roughly every 5th interview

Men received callbacks 7.26% of the time, or roughly every 18th interview.

Austria was the most extreme example, with women receiving callbacks 20.9% of the time, and men receiving callbacks 2.6% of the time. This means women in Austria are about 800% more likely than men to be called back for part time work after an interview

[this is the data for full time work](https://imgur.com/a/SjoUejh)

Women received callbacks 19.62% of the time. Men received callbacks 11.53% of the time. This is slightly less than a 2:1 greater ratio for women

Austria again showed the most extreme difference, with women being called backed 19.56% of the time- roughly every 5th interview, and men being called back 6.87% of the time, roughly every 19th interview

559,u8n120,2022-04-21,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,"Soft power is much more relevant than hard power, and women are the ones who have the most power in society under this metric, not men","People usually point to the apex fallacy when discussions about power and patriarchy come up, but I think there's a much more important discussion to be had around soft power instead.

Even if men make up 60% of senators and 90% of CEOs, they represent fewer than 20% of people who have power at home, and only 16% of people who have custody over their children.

Women on average get their way socially, legally, at home, in the marriage and dating world, and in many other areas of life.

That represents a metric of power that is much more relevant to the vast majority of people. It is a form of power over your own life, and over the lives of other people who you know personally.

For example, 80% of relationships are controlled and dominated by women.  Women also display much higher levels of social aggression and are more likely to get their way in gender mixed friends groups.

If men are being bossed around in their homes and have no say over their bodily autonomy, reproductive choices, or their own labor and financial future, then it doesn't really matter if they might have a measure of power at work.

In the end whatever power they have publicly can be used and manipulated in private by other people.

The fact that men often hold formal positions of power in society may even be *because* other people push them there for their own benefit.

After all, it is more preferable to be the wife of a CEO than to be a CEO yourself. The vast majority of wealthy women do not work, do not cook, do not clean, and often times don't even raise their own children.  They have chefs, maids, and babysitters who handle all of that.  Many have vacation homes financed by their husbands where they go to sip margaritas all day long by the beach.

Meanwhile the average CEO works 80 hours a week under stressful conditions and ultimately does not have any power when he comes home: his wife can leave him, take his money, his children, and continue her privileged lifestyle without him.  She can force him to continue working for her benefit regardless of any plans he might have to retire, and she can often dictate the terms and conditions that he gets to see his children under.

This is a rather bleak outlook despite being a ""powerful CEO"", which should make you wonder how much power a regular working man has.

Any analysis that fails to look at this is going to be fundamentally flawed.

The good news is that there are some pretty straightforward legislative solutions to some of these issues, for example through family court reform.  So it is fixable.

560,kezhnf,2020-12-17,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,"The earliest identified pattern of occupational cancers affected the testicles of prepubescent boy chimney sweepers in Victorian era England. They lived short, terrible lives and rarely reached adulthood.","One thing I haven't seen discussed very much is the long history of boys being used for some truly terrible jobs throughout history.

One of those jobs was the chimney sweep.  They used young boys because they were both small enough to go inside chimneys and because they were disposable enough to be made to do it.

Not only was this a terrible job to perform, but the earliest example of an occupational cancer was identified in chimney sweepers. The cancer affected their testicles and started out as a sore on the outside of the scrotum known as ""soot wart"". A combination of cancer, lung diseases, and other medical problems meant that most never lived to be 18, or were disabled before they became adults.

The phrase *""to light a fire under someone""* originated from this practice.  If the chimney sweeper was taking too long, they would start a fire in the fireplace to make him work faster.

It was also common for them to get stuck or lost in chimney mazes. Chimneys used to have branches between different buildings that were difficult to navigate. And they would let the boys die from dehydration or asphyxiation before they would destroy the chimney to get them out.

There was such a high demand for boy chimney sweepers that families would sell their sons into what was essentially slavery for extra cash.

In India they still use boys to mine certain shafts that are too small for adults to fit in.

The term delivery boy (and it's negative connotation) likely shares a common heritage with other ""boy occupations"" that we forced boys to do.

Child labor laws were originally implemented because people became appalled at the working and living conditions of chimney sweeps (who often walked around in soot covered rags because that's all they were given to wear).  Those laws largely went ignored for hundreds of years though because enforcement was sparse.

Even today, these jobs tend to be performed by men. Conditions, and pay, are obviously better. But many traditional male occupations are looked down on as ""lower class"" even if the pay is comparatively better to the more comfortable jobs that women perform.  It's ""men's work"" which somehow makes it lower in prestige, and less desirable, than ""women's work"".

Here's a short video about chimney sweepers and a couple Wikipedia articles:

The election work with seats.

The party (not far right but still right wing) which got the most seats (125/209)  for Île de France  will :

&#x200B;

* Double the number of housing for homelesses. But she will make half of it women only the rest will  probably be gender neutral. But +60% of homelesses are male, 85% of rough sleepers, the worst form of homlessness, are men and +90% of rough sleepers dying are men too. Female homelesses are already something like 30% more likely to find housing.
* Proud of her administration having 60% of female directors because equality
* Make a thousand of the HLM (low rent government funded appartment to lower class people) reserved to female victims of domestic abuse
* Stop giving financial help to companies who doesn't pay women as much as men. It is so vague that I think she will compare the average salary of men and women to decide it. Therefore companies will have to hire and promote women to get fund.

&#x200B;

The party (green/left alliance) with the second most seats (53/209) want to give even more fund to a feminist propaganda organisation ""maison des femmes"". They also offer employement, social financial and legal help for women only  (any kind, like migrant rights, learning french, rent issues, health etc. basically a women only welfare system in addition to the Government's direct \*\*gender neutral\*\* welfare system). Basically it is a local second women only government and community service funded by Government and local public institutions because ""women most affected"". Obviously they also offer women only help about domestic and sexual abuse.

&#x200B;

There are no services or shelters for male victims of domestic and sexual violence in Ile de France. The only one I know outside Ile de France are likely activists who shelter men in their own house. Almost every services of these kind in the country are women only explicitly or implicitly.

562,morq73,2021-04-11,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Men being held to gender roles is ruining my dreams,"Gender issues in a nutshell. Women have been freed from traditional gender roles. Men are still held to them

So I found a job / career that I would like to do and am doing it right now part time. However, it is a seasonal job. Work like crazy 5-6 months; part-time rest of the year. Just the nature of the industry. I enjoy it and am really good it. However, there is not much income / wealth growth in the industry. Will probably make $45,000 / year at most; $55,000 - $60,000 / year at peak, if I go all in and full time on this. Now honestly, $45K is poverty wages in Canada, especially with insane housing prices.

Now I can make more; I am just finishing up law school. But I found that this was the career I would like to do. What I also like is playing with and spending time with kids and I know that I can be an excellent parent. I am confident I can raise kids better than anyone I met around my age, male or female. I also enjoy baking and do some crochet. I'm by no means an expert. But I'm working at it. Bottom line, I could be a good stay-at-home Parent.

So ideally what I would like would be to marry a successful Woman. Say an Accountant, Lawyer, Engineer, or Doctor. Support her by doing the house work and caring for kids while also working part-time on the side (the way most stay-at-home parents do). When the kids are in school, I can work more during the busy season. The nature of the work allows me to have that flexibility. Work more before we have kids; work less when kids are young; work more as they become older. Do a job I love. That would be the dream.

If I was a Woman. that dream would be accessible to me. Because Women are not expected to be providers. But because Women have been freed from gender roles while Men are still held to them; I am seen as and expected to be a provider, an ATM, and that dream is inaccessible to me. I'd be forced to be a corporate drone working all the time simply because of my gender, and likely be expected to marry down and be a provider. Because Women expect Men to earn more while Men are attacked for wanting fairness in what their partner brings to the table vis-a-vis what they bring (know from personal experience). Being a Woman would have allowed me to live the life I want. Being a Man gets in the way.

Now some might say to forgo marriage. But that's not what I am looking for. I am looking for someone to love and have kids with. A Man, unlike a Woman, cannot have kids outside of marriage. We can't walk into an egg bank the way Women can walk into a sperm bank. We cannot have a kid after a hook up and then choose to keep it.

Someone else might say to adopt. But adoptions is not the same. And doesn't help with the no spouse problem. Bottom line. Because Men - unlike Women - are still held to gender roles; I cannot have the life I desire.",TC18271851,t2_ax388u38,0.96,41,9
563,ijqpay,2020-08-31,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Starting a new men's movement to address several issues that aren't being tackled currently,"We currently have a subreddit and are slowly building a new men's movement to address three primary men's issues:

1. Men have no socially accepted way to be strong. Masculinity is often defined as wholly toxic and and condemned by certain parts of society. In response we're offering a scientifically validated (and psychologist approved) definition of masculinity that helps men become strong, successful, capable and healthy. We don't expect every man will want to follow it, but being strong and successful absolutely needs to be a supported option for the men who do.
2. [Stanford](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/social-norms/) states that social norms are so effective in enforcing behavior they are a viable alternative to laws. We also know that restrictive norms against women working strongly predict the relative labor force participation of women in wealthy countries (data from [1](http://hdr.undp.org/en/gsni), [2](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS), [3](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.MA.ZS)). We also know that differential labor done in the past is largely the cause of what feminists fought for pretty much all of the 20th century ([study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w17098)). What we don't know is where norms stand for men. Our goal is to determine this and to ensure equal support, recognition and opportunity for success for both men and women.
3. Last, but arguably most importantly, there is some stigma around men building stronger connections and groups with each other. We believe thanks to the work of other men's movements this is starting to shift, and we intend to help continue this in whatever way we can.

So as a mobile user you will have to switch to the official app to access Reddit from July 1. All third-party apps have responded that they will need to shut down. Clearly Reddit Inc. cares more about making money than about the user experience.

It is also feared that this will affect /r/toolbox, a tool used by moderators. In line with this is the expectation that sooner or later they will shut down old.reddit.com, and effectively RES.

We do not wish to moderate under those circumstances, as they make our job incredibly harder without those tools. The official tools are not sufficient.

In protest **we will join the subreddit blackout** that is being organized on June 12 to 14.

I'm NOT a feminist (I'm egalitarian), and the wage gap hurts men too. The social function and beliefs about men raising kids play a role in creating a wage gap in the first place. A friend literally just told me he wants to be a stay at home dad but he can't (because society would look down on that). Let's look at some data:

https://journalistsresource.org/economics/pay-gap/ 

Data shows that the pay gap for similar educated women, in similar occupations exist. This is due to a wide variety of factors, a large chunk of which are social beliefs about the roles and expectations of the gender in things like child raising, hours, etc. This is a bad thing for everyone on many levels.

The common representation of this is pretty bad (media is terrible), but ultimately, even as left wing male advocates, it is important we consider facts that don't agree with what might be some beliefs we hold closely and consider what the data says. I understand that the role of discrimination is not clarified perfectly (just like it isn't in studies of racial work discrimination either).

As much as we can argue about the job market being amoral, we have to recognize that the role of jobs and salaries in deciding freedom and opportunity is important. I'm a left wing socialist. The fact is that if women and men are being put in different positions by the market due to things like different working hours and flexibility, we can make changes on the social front (by being more egalitarian in division of responsibilities) and the market front (by incorporating policies that are good for all, like paternity leave, increasing and demanding flexibility for men, creating better policies regarding time off, childcare, reducing penalties, valuing less valued work, etc.)",confusedbonobo007,t2_16a13r9l,0.54,2,27
566,j4z9iq,2020-10-04,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Corporations support feminism and racial separatism because it destroys working-class solidarity,"Before 2014, the left used to have a simple message for everybody who wasn't super-rich: stick together.

It was the norm to refer to all people, regardless of color or sex as ""brother/sister"".

Until the corporations found a tiny group of insane people who want to divide everybody, but who claim to be in line with the goals of the left. These people are hate-filled pieces of shit who say that we are deeply separated from our fellow human beings because of skin tone or biological sex.

They have a single united message: if you are of the ""oppressor"" sex or skin color, you are always maximally evil **unless** you spend every day of the rest of your life repeating a long series of political slogans, and directing all of your money to the groups who write those political slogans.

Of course, only a small minority of rich people can possibly comply with those commands so the inevitable  result is that the vast majority of the people with the ""wrong"" skin color or sex will disengage from the racial and sex separatists.

They need to keep us divided, because united we might suddenly remember what we remembered in the early days of Occupy: all of our problems come directly from that fact that 5% of the population has hoarded 70% of the wealth.

You should study how Occupy was defeated: in the early days it was all about class. Black and white straight bi and gay people getting together as total equals to demand economic redistribution, like in the 1930s.

But then, a bunch of elite kids of millionaires from the Ivy League take over, and order the entire crowd to drop the equality. No more equal access to speaking time. Speaking time is now solely allotted according to your oppression status. If you're not brown or gay or trans, you talk last.

Occupy swiftly disappeared and never began again.

If you're in a left-wing discussion and somebody says that equality has to stop, be aware that that person is fighting to make sure the Bezos family keep every cent of their resources. He may not know it, but the billionaires know it, and are funding the anti-equality brigade.

Most obvious recent example: there's a racist idiot called Ibram X. Kendi, who preaches that racial discrimination must be legalized, so that resources can be funneled to brown-skinned people regardless of a non-brown person has a better claim to those resources. CEO of Twitter (one percenter, net worth  above $100m) sent him a check for ten MEEELION dollars.

But also, follow any non-Fox network. They all support racial and sex separatist movements, and declare everyone a bigot who doesn't. Meaning the only mainstream alternative to sex-separatism or racism is an objectively bigoted network for christian fundamentalists. If you're neither a paranoid right-wing fundie or a racist misandrist, there's virtually nothing that caters for you except this subreddit.",czerdec,t2_qo1hq,0.97,205,69
567,jhsdrr,2020-10-25,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,The core of the problem.,"Why traditional gender roles exist(ed) ? there is a lot of factors i will give few of them, the first is [life expectancy](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy). 

&#x200B;

>Globally the **life expectancy increased from less than 30 years to over 72 years; after two centuries of progress we can expect to live much more than twice as long as our ancestors**. And this progress was not achieved in a few places. In every world region people today can expect to live more than twice as long.

The second is [child mortality](https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-in-the-past).

&#x200B;

>Many researchers have independently studied mortality rates for children in the past: in different societies, locations, and historical periods. The average across a large number of historical studies suggests that in the past around **one-quarter of infants died in their first year** of life and around **half of all children died before they reached the end of puberty**.  
>  
>Since then the risk of death for children has fallen around the world. The global average today is 10 times lower than the average of the past. In countries with the best child health today **an infant is 170 times more likely to survive**.

The type of work (need for physical strength).

&#x200B;

>As countries develop, the share of the population working in agriculture is declining. While more than two-thirds of the population in poor countries work in agriculture, less than 5% of the population does in rich countries. It is predominantly the huge productivity increase that makes this reduction in labor possible.

In year 1400 the [majority of people worked in farming](https://ourworldindata.org/employment-in-agriculture) and other jobs that demand high physical strength that women on average can't do. 71% in France, 60% in Italy, 57% in England worked in farming. (even today farming still male dominated industry, despite the fact it is easier with the use of technology that didn't exist in the past)

Because of all that and other natural factors gender roles were created by humans to ensure the continuation of the specie. that's why only women and girls had to be reduced to ""babies machines"" like some feminists say because you live less than 30 year and infant mortality was very high. men and boys were redused to machines too but in different ways. they has to do all the hard and dengerous jobs to provide for the family that's why men showing vulnerability is stigmatized. men were (and still) expected to face danger without fear and sacrifice themselves.

&#x200B;

>So one of my core themes in The Myth of Male Power—that **history’s controlling force was not patriarchy, but survival**—is still ignored. Instead, the leading universities’ women’s studies and “gender studies” courses still emanate from the Marxist and Civil Rights model of oppressor vs. oppressed. We’ll see in this book exactly why the dichotomy of oppressor/oppressed is both inaccurate and, more important, undermines love and women’s empowerment. In virtually every leading university **this leads to a demonizing of men and masculinity** that distorts the very essence of traditional masculinity—being socialized to be a hero by being willing to sacrifice oneself in war or in work. The possibility that being socialized to be disposable is not genuine power is, to this day, either considered radical, heretical, or, most frequently, not considered.”

>― Warren Farrell, [The Myth of Male Power](https://archive.org/details/warren_farrell_the_myth_of_male_power_why_men_are_the_disposable_sex/page/n12/mode/1up)

And he add:

&#x200B;

>We have lived in **a world that has been in various ways both male dominated and female dominated**, both patriarchal and matriarchal, and **more bi-sexist than sexist**. .. and when survival-needs dominate, neither sex has power, but roles .. 

This is true, even in Saudi Arabia sexism against men (misandry) is rampant ! every time a man is killed by his wife you read all the comments (in Saoudi websites) saying ""he must did something"" ""maybe he abused her first"" ""is she killed him he must made her suffer a lot"" ... they can't undrestand that women commit domestic violence too.

When Amber heard said she was abused by Johnny Depp everyone believed her (because she is woman) with no evidence. she even won awards for it ! then later audios proved she was the abuser. 

That's why the gender conversation should focus on both **men's rights (areas of male disadvantage)** and women's rights (areas of female disadvantage). both misogyny (anti female sexism) and **misandry (anti male sexism)** 

# The patriarchy theory (and feminism) is false and bigoted:

But feminism only recognize half of the picture, from the first wave feminism only raise awareness on women's rights, while ignoring and silencing anyone who talk about men's rights.

I am transposing this from an Amazon review of Mary Marcy's book *Women As Sex Vendors - or, Why Women Are Conservative*.  Mary Marcy was an early socialist who, much like other socialists from the same time period, also championed for men's rights issues. A topic that is intellectually consistent with left-wing political ideology, but that would eventually be left behind, at least in part, by subsequent generations of leftists.

Her main thesis compares ""owning the means of production"" to ""owning the means of reproduction"".  She thus positions women, inside of the marital unit, to that of the bourgeoisie inside of capitalism.  So in the same way that laborers can be said to work for the material benefit of capital owners, men can be said to work for the material benefit of women.

#Marxism, Men’s Rights and 'the Means of Reproduction’ – A Forgotten 'Marxist-Masculist’ Men’s Rights Masterpiece

If any feminist claim enjoys even more widespread acceptance than that which asserts that women are oppressed in the West today, it is that which asserts that women were even more oppressed in the recent past before the feminists rode heroically to their rescue.

It may therefore come as a surprise to many that Mary Marcy, a leading early twentieth century American socialist – and moreover a woman – co-authored this short pamphlet with one R.B. Tobias (apparently her brother) in 1918, in which they both acknowledge the existence of [female privilege](https://archive.org/details/MartinVanCreveldThePrivilegedSex2013/mode/1up) even then and formulate a unique and persuasive theory to explain this phenomenon.

Yet, far from abandoning socialism, Tobias and Marcy’s thesis is framed in terms of, and derived from, orthodox Marxist economic theory. Indeed, as we will see, it is more consistent with Marxist theory than the inane ramblings of many self-styled 'Marxist-feminists', 'feminist-Marxists' and other assorted professional damned fools of the contemporary academic establishment – and indeed more compatible with orthodox Marxist theory even than Friedrich Engels’ own writings on gender relations and the family.

It also explains many aspects of the relations between the sexes in their time and ours, and is also eminently reconcilable with modern sociobiological theory.

**Feminism & Marxism: A Match Made in Hell?**

Let's first see where most Marxists and feminists have gone wrong in applying Marxist theory to the relations between the sexes. The problem began, not with feminists, nor with Marx, but rather the latter’s financial backer, collaborator and disciple, Fredrich Engels.

In a famous passage from [The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/index.htm), Engels writes:

>“In the great majority of cases today, at least in the possessing classes, the husband is obliged to earn a living and support his family, and that in itself gives him a position of supremacy, without any need for special legal titles and privileges. Within the family he is the bourgeois and the wife represents the proletariat.”

This passage is much-quoted by feminists, and arguably provides one of the key foundations of modern feminism. Unfortunately, it is not simply wrong, but also fundamentally incompatible with the very Marxist theory that Engels purports to apply.

After all, according to Marxist theory, the defining characteristic of the proletariat is that, lacking ownership of the so-called 'Means of Production' (capital, factories etc.), they are therefore obliged to sell their labour to the capitalist class as a means of supporting themselves.

In contrast, the bourgeoisie (i.e. capitalists) are defined by their ownership of the 'Means of Production'. This means that, unlike the proletariat, they do not have to sell their labour, and are able instead to subsist, and prosper, by employing proletarians and extracting 'surplus value' (i.e. profits).

In short, the proletariat are obliged to sell their labour to make a living; the bourgeoisie/capitalists are not, being able instead to exploit the labour of the former.

Thus, contrary to Engels, the fact that the husband is, in Engels’ words, “obliged to earn a living and support his family” does not make him bourgeois. On the contrary, it makes him the quintessential proletarian.

In contrast, it is the housewife, who is supported at the expense of her husband, who occupies a position analogous to the bourgeois. Both are spared work and instead supported at the expense of male labourers.

**Women as Capitialists**

This then begs the question of how women achieve this remarkable feat – namely being supported by their husbands without having to work themselves.

Here, Tobias and Marcy come in. Their theory explains the privileged economic position of women by equating their economic situation directly with that of the bourgeoisie.

“As a sex”, the authors explain, “women occupy a position similar to the petty shop-keeper, because they possess a commodity to sell or to barter. Men, as a sex, are buyers of, or barterers for, this commodity”.

In short, “women occupy a position similar to the petty shop-keeper, because they possess a commodity to sell or to barter besides their own labour power”.

In other words, whereas the male proletarian famously has ""nothing to sell but his labour"", the same is not true of a woman irrespective of her social class. She has something else to sell – namely her body (or, to be more accurate, access to certain orifices therein).

Women are thus, in essence, as Tobias and Marcy put it in their title, “Sex Vendors”.

Thus, for Marcy and Tobias, all women are, in some sense, 'sex vendors', from the prostitute to the prude, the puritan to the princess, the housewife to the whore.

Indeed, to this day, the entire process of conventional courtship is predicated on prostitution, from the social expectation that the man pay for dinner on the first date, to the legal obligation that he continue to support his ex-wife, through alimony and maintenance, for anything up to several decades after he has belatedly ridden himself of her.

**Marxism, Men’s Rights and the 'Means of Reproduction'**

Let us then convert Tobias and Marcy’s analysis into the terminology of orthodox Marxist theory, and then, by extension, into the terms of modern evolutionary biology.

According to orthodox Marxist theory, the bourgeoisie are able to exploit the workers in their employment without having to labour themselves because they control what Marxists refer to as the ‘Means of Production’ – i.e. the means required to produce products and services for sale (e.g. land, factories, capital).

How then do women achieve an analogous feat, despite the fact that most own no factories themselves (though they may indirectly own factories through their husbands)?

This is because they control, not the ‘Means of Production’, but rather what we might term the ‘Means of Reproduction’ – i.e. their own vaginas, wombs, ovaries etc.

Whereas the ‘Means of Production’ are defined by Marxists as the means necessary to produce products for sale, the ‘Means of Reproduction’ can similarly be defined as the means necessary to produce offspring.

**Sociobiology and the 'Means of Reproduction'**

Of course, both a male and a female, a sperm and an egg, are necessary to produce offspring. How then can it be said that women control the 'Means of Reproduction' any more than men do?

Here, we must turn from Marxist economics to Darwinian biology. In particular, modern sociobiological theory comes in to explain what Tobias and Marcy grasped only intuitively. In short, since women had to make a greater minimum investment in offspring for the offspring to survive in the 'Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness' (i.e. an ovum + 9 months gestation + subsequent nursing vs. a single ejaculate), it is women who represent the limiting factor in human reproduction.

As a result, a male can potentially father huge numbers of offspring with multiple females (e.g. Moulay Ismail the Bloodthirstly, an emperor of Morocco, who reputedly fathered some 888 offspring via a vast harem of wives/concubines). In contrast, a woman is limited, save in the case of twins, to one offspring every nine months, and is unlikely to conceive again for as long as she continues breastfeeding, a prerequisite if an offspring was to survive under ancestral environments.

Therefore, it is males who compete to mate with females rather than vice versa (Bateman 1948; Trivers 1972).

In an important sense then, in the same way capitalists can be said to own and control the 'Means of Reproduction’, even though labour, like capital, is required to produce products for sale, so women can be said to possess and control the 'Means of Reproduction', since (at least in societies where arranged marriages are no longer widely practised) it is they who determine whom they choose to have sex with.

Yet, from a Darwinian perspective, the production of offspring is nothing less than the basic function and purpose of all organisms. In contrast, production, whether of food for self-sustenance, or products for sale in market economy, is, from a Darwinian perspective, simply the means to accumulate sufficient resources to facilitate successful reproduction.

As sociologist Pierre van den Berghe writes, from a Darwinian perspective, ""the ultimate measure of human success is not production but reproduction"" and ""economic productivity and profit are means to reproductive ends, not ends in themselves"" ([The Ethnic Phenomenon](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2578090), p. 165).

Thus, in his focus on economics at the expense of sex and reproduction, Marx was, for all his radicalism, just another Victorian sexual prude.

In a sense, therefore, from a sociobiological perspective, women’s advantage is more fundamental than that of other capitalists.

This then suggests that Tobias and Marcy’s claim that women “occupy a position similar to the petty shop-keeper” is perhaps something of an understatement.

While some women sell their bodies (relatively) cheaply (e.g. the street prostitute, or wife of a manual labourer), others successfully negotiate a price that is positively exorbitant (e.g. the wife, or ex-wife, of a millionaire tycoon). Therefore, the proper analogy is perhaps not with the petty bourgeoisie but with the capitalist class as a whole.

**Are Women Wealthier?**

In orthodox Marxist theory, economics determines culture (or, in Marxist terminology, the 'Base' determines the 'Superstructure'). However, Tobais and Marcy are more sophisticated than most modern Marxists in that they recognise that, in the same way economics determines culture, it is biology that determines economics.

In this context, Tobias and Marcy rightly conclude, “human beings are human animals however much we may pretend to the contrary”.

This then is the ultimate source of women’s advantage. Tobais and Marcy explain:

>“Women, as a sex, are the owners of a commodity vitally necessary to the health and well-being of man [i.e. sex]. Women occupy a more fortunate biologic, and in many countries, a more fortunate economic position in the struggle for existence.”

The claim that women occupy “a more fortunate economic position” in modern Western society is, of course, the opposite of what we are indoctrinated to believe by feminists and the mainstream media. On the contrary, according to the conventional wisdom, it is women who are supposedly economically disadvantaged.

The usual evidence cited in support of this claim is the so-called ‘Wage Gap’ or ‘Glass Ceiling’, whereby men are known to earn (on average) more money than women do. In fact, however, this claim represents the fundamental fallacy of feminism.

It is true that men do indeed earn more money on average than women (not least because [they work longer hours in more dangerous and unpleasant conditions for a greater proportion of their adult lives](https://warrenfarrell.com/product/why-men-earn-more/)). However, this does not mean they are wealthier.

On the contrary, the additional earnings men receive are then largely redistributed to women by such mechanisms as marriage, divorce, alimony, maintenance and the tendency of most men to spend a considerable proportion of their income on their wife or girlfriend.

As we have seen, the entire process of conventional courtship is predicated on the redistribution of wealth from men to women, from the social expectation that the man pays for dinner on the first date to the legal obligation that he continue to support his ex-wife through alimony/maintenance for anything up to several decades after he has belatedly rid himself of her.

The result is that, while men earn more money than women, researchers in the marketing industry have long known that women dominate almost every area of consumer spending, some estimates putting this at 80% of household spending ([Marketing to Women: How to Increase Your Share of the World's Largest Market](https://books.google.com/books/about/Marketing_to_Women.html?id=vixnMwEACAAJ), p. 6).

This, of course, follows directly from Tobias and Marcy’s observation that women are indeed “Sex Vendors” – and the price they exact in return for what Esther Vilar termed “periodic access to their orifices” is indeed exorbitant.

**Are Men Poorer?**

Unfortunately, this data on consumer spending was not available to Tobias and Marcy. Instead, their evidence that men were indeed economically worse-off than women was, in some respects, more direct:

>“That there are no women hoboes in the civilized world today is,” they observe, “incontestable proof of the superiority of the economic status of woman over man”.

To say that there were no female 'hoboes' (i.e. homeless) is surely an exaggeration. George Orwell, another early-twentieth century socialist and anti-feminist, writing fifteen years later, provided a more accurate estimate, based on both government statistics and his own experience of living among the destitute.

Orwell writes, “at the charity level men outnumber women by something like ten to one” ([Down and Out in Paris and London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London)). The disparity remains similar to this day.

Orwell himself offered two explanations for this disparity. First, he observed, “unemployment affects women less than men”.

However, this, of course, begs the question as to why unemployment affects women less. Here, Tobais and Marcy provide the answer.

Indeed, the answer flows directly from their theory of women as sex vendors. “When a woman loses her job”, they write, “she has always the sale of her sex to fall back on as a last resort”.

In other words, she can either prostitute herself to multiple males in order to support herself (i.e. become a prostitute) or, better still, find some man foolish enough to financially support her in return for sexual favours (i.e. a husband). In contrast, for unemployed males, the only alternative to penury is crime or suicide.

Thus, they explain, ""there is no office or saloon scrub-woman so old and so unattractive, no dish-washer so sodden, that she does not know, tucked far away in her inner consciousness, perhaps, that, if the very worst comes and she loses her job, there is the truck driver or the office clerk, the shaky-legged bar patron on the road to early locomotor ataxia, who can be counted on to tide her over in an emergency – usually for goods delivered"".

This incidentally echoes Orwell’s second explanation for the overrepresentation of men among the homeless, namely “any presentable woman can, in the last resort, attach herself to some man”. Thus, Orwell, Tobais and Marcy seem in general agreement on the causes of the gender disparity in homelessness.

**From Economic Power to Social and Political Power**

Just as their biological advantage and resulting sexual power translates into economic privilege, so women’s economic privilege readily converts into social and legal privileges over men.

Thus, applying Marxist social theory to the relations between the sexes, Tobais and Marcy explain:

>“The laws today protect the owners of property and the economically powerful. The more economic power a group, or a class, or a sex possesses, the more the state throws the mantle of its protective laws about it. Women are the owners of a commodity for which men are buyers or barterers, and our modern laws protect woman at the expense of man.”

This, of course, again conflicts with the conventional wisdom which holds it is women who are the victims of discrimination by the legal system and that, moreover, this discrimination was especially extreme in the period when Tobias and Marcy were writing.

In truth, however, men were discriminated in countless ways under early twentieth-century legal systems. The best contemporary summary of the many forms of discrimination against males in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century, albeit focussed on the UK rather than the US, is provided by Ernest Belfort Bax’s co-authored [The Legal Subjection of Men](https://archive.org/details/legalsubjection00baxgoog/mode/2up), first published at the turn of the twentieth century.

Tobais and Marcy discuss only one form of legal discrimination against males specifically – namely matrimonial law. Thus, they write:

>“Marriage is a legal contract; but whom does it bind? Certainly not the woman, nor any woman in America. For she may easily free herself and even divorce and penalize her husband if she is dissatisfied either with him or his earnings; or she may evade all the obligations she is supposed to meet almost always with absolute impunity.”

This echoes Mencken’s observation in a book first published the very same year as Tobais and Marcy’s pamphlet that ""Under the contract of marriage, all the duties lie upon the man and all the privileges appertain to the woman"" ([In Defense of Women](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1270/1270-h/1270-h.htm)).

Lest this be doubted, I will quote from Bax et al’s 'The Legal Subjection of Men' at some length. Bax and his co-author observe:

>""As against her husband, the law confers upon a woman who has married him the unilateral privilege of maintenance"" and ""the most violent methods, including imprisonment and sequestration of the property of the husband, are employed to enforce her claim"", whereas “a woman has complete control over all property acquired or inherited by her in any way, free from any claim on the part of her husband” and “even a wife who, against her husband's wish, leaves the house after assaulting and insulting him can obtain against him an order for restitution of conjugal rights [i.e. the sequestration of the husband's property]"", yet ""no disobedience to a like order on her part enables her property to be confiscated or herself... sent to prison.""

So much then for the oppression of women in early-twentieth century marriage.

However, matrimonial law was hardly the only form of anti-male discrimination in early-twentieth century British law. On the contrary, examples are legion, from the Abolition of the Whipping of Female Offenders Act 1820, which abolished the whipping of female offenders under English law in 1820, a form of punishment that remained sanctioned for males until 1967; to the common law doctrine of coverture, whereby husbands were liable for debts incurred, civil wrongs committed and sometimes even crimes committed by their wives.

**Why Women Are Conservative**

Tobias and Marcy's book was first published under two alternate titles. Thus far my discussion has focussed on the themes encapsulated by the first of these titles, namely “Women as Sex Vendors”. It is now necessary to turn to the topic encapsulated by the second of the two titles, namely “Why Women Are Conservative”.

According to the Marxist theory applied by the authors, the answer to this question flows naturally from their conclusions regarding the privileged legal and economic position of women vis-à-vis their husbands and other males.

If women are indeed privileged over men, both economically and in law, it is natural that they should seek to maintain this situation, and hence favour the preservation of the status quo. In other words, like other privileged groups throughout history, they are conservative.

As Tobias and Marcy put it, “the preferred class, the biologically and economically favored class, or sex, has rarely been efficient-to-do, has never been revolutionary to attack a social system that accords advantage to it”. Thus, “women have rarely been rebels or revolutionaries” simply because “revolt comes from the submerged never from the group occupying a favored place”.

In short, women are not revolutionaries for the same reason feudal aristocrats did not join the Peasant's Revolt and slave-owners rarely campaigned for the abolition of slavery. In short, women do not seek the overthrow of the economic and political status quo for the simple reason that women are among the chief beneficiaries this system.

**But Are Women Conservative?**

Of course, many Americans may protest that women are not more conservative than men. On the contrary, in most recent elections, American women have been slightly more likely to vote for the Democratic Party candidate (ostensibly liberal) while men have shown more support for Republican candidates (ostensibly conservative).

In Britain, the position has traditionally been the reverse of this, with women rather more likely to vote Conservative than men. However, Britain now seems to be gradually realigning on the American model.

There are a few points to be made here. Firstly, Democratic Party candidates for elective office in US (except perhaps in a few cases) are hardly genuinely radical or revolutionary in the sense advocated by socialists such as Marcy and Tobias. Rather than seeking to overthrow the system, they seek to perpetuate and work within it, albeit reforming it in various ways from within (as do Republicans).

In contrast, genuinely radical and revolutionary parties and movements seem to remain disproportionately male in composition. Political radicalism and extremism, of all persuasions (feminism perhaps excepted) seems to be an almost exclusively male form of recreational pastime.

Also, it ought to be noted that women are also considerably more conservative than are men with respect to sexual morality. Thus, women are more likely than men to disapprove of such behaviours as sex before marriage, promiscuity, pornography, prostitution, and other such fun and healthy recreational activities.

This again reflects economic advantage. As psychologists Baumeister and Twenge explain, “Just as any monopoly tends to oppose the appearance of low-priced substitutes that could undermine its market control, women will oppose various alternative outlets for male sexual gratification” (Baumeister and Twenge 2002). These outlets of course include such things as prostitution, pornography and premarital promiscuity.

This then explains why women almost universally disdain those among their number who are perceived as giving away sex too freely, or at too low a price. As Baumeister and Vohs recognise (Baumeister and Vohs 2004):

>“A rational economic strategy that many monopolies or cartels have pursued is to try to increase the price of their assets by artificially restricting the supply. With sex, this would entail having the women put pressure on each other to exercise sexual restraint and hold out for a high price (such as a commitment to marriage) before engaging in sex.”

Women therefore operate something of a price-fixing cartel.

This same insight is alighted upon by Tobais and Marcy, whose Marxian approach to sexual relations represents something of a precursor to the economic analysis of Baumeister and colleagues.

Thus, Tobias and Marcy demand:

>“Why is the woman of the streets, who spends her sex earnings upon her lover, scorned universally? Is it not because [she is], unconsciously violating the code, or the trade 'understandings’, in giving not only of themselves, but their substance as well. These women are selling below the market, or scabbing on the job.”

[For more on this issue, see my blog post on “[The Sex Cartel: Puritanism and Prudery as Price-Fixing Among Prostitutes](https://thecontemporaryheretic.com/2015/10/31/the-sex-cartel-puritanism-and-prudery-as-price-fixing-among-prostitutes/)” at [TheContemporaryHeretic](https://thecontemporaryheretic.com/).]

**Why (Single) Women Vote for Leftist Parties**

However, this discussion still leaves open the question of why women in contemporary America are actually more likely to vote for the relatively more leftist candidates than are their husbands, fathers and brothers.

The answer, I suspect, lies in the extension of the welfare state in the years since Tobias and Marcy published their pamphlet.

In most modern western liberal democratic economies, women, especially single mothers, are the predominant recipients and beneficiaries of state welfare programmes.

For these women therefore, government functions, in Warren Farrell’s memorable formulation, “as a substitute husband”, resulting in “a new nuclear family: woman, government and child”.

Thus, whereas women traditionally looked to husbands to protect and provide for them, with the growth of the welfare state in the years since the publication of Tobias and Marcy’s work, women in general, and single women in particular, have increasingly come to depend on and be provided for, not by husbands, fathers or boyfriends, but rather by government.

One way or another, however, it is still men who are left footing the bill. In short, since men do most of the productive work and are therefore the principle wage-earners in the economy, it is they who are largely responsible for footing the tax bill. Thus, whereas men, as a whole, are net contributors to public monies, women are net recipients.

As Martin Van Creveld concludes, “On the face of it, a husband, a charitable institution and a modern welfare state are entirely different. In fact... the principle is the same. All are designed partly – and some would say primarily – to transfer resources from men... to women"" (The Privileged Sex, p. 137).

It is thus notable that, while much play is made out of the rather small sex gap in voting patterns, a far more significant predictor of voting patterns among women is their marital status. For example, whereas single women voted overwhelmingly for Obama at the last presidential election, most married women voted for Romney.

This is entirely congruent with economic interests. Whereas single women, especially single mothers, look to “government as a substitute husband” to support them, married women lose out from this arrangement, since the more taxation is extracted from their husbands to support the lifestyles of unemployed single mothers, the less, in their view, he has left to spend on them.

In truth, therefore, the single women who vote disproportionately for left-liberal political candidates in US elections are as conservative as the married women who vote conservative. Both they are conservatives in that they are seeking to conserve, and expand, the economic and other privileges accorded them under the present system of laws enacted by government.

**But What About the Feminists?**

This discussion, however, leaves one matter unanswered. If it was women, not men, who were socially, economically and legally privileged at the expense of males, how then can we explain the growth and tremendous success of the feminist movement in the years since Tobias and Marcy published their pamphlet.

This topic, of course, goes beyond the subject matter of Tobias and Marcy’s pamphlet. They did not anticipate this development, nor should they have, since it was not directly relevant to their theme.

Nevertheless, it is a paradox deserving of resolution and, as a concluding thought, I propose to address it. My conclusion is that, while feminism is not supported by Marxist theory, it might nevertheless be explained by Marxist theory.

According to Marxist theory, the 'dominant ideology' promoted by the prevailing power structures (e.g. the media, the government, the education system) invariably reflects and promote the interests of dominant groups within society.

If any ideology has been relentlessly promoted, celebrated and protected from legitimate criticism by the contemporary ruling classes, as reflected in the media, education system, government policy etc., it is, of course, feminism.

Why is this so? How then does feminism promote the interests of the capitalist class? To anyone versed in orthodox Marxist social theory, the answer should be obvious.

By encouraging more women to pursue careers and continue in paid employment after marriage rather than opting for stay-at-home motherhood, feminism thereby increased the supply of labour available to capitalists, helping to drive down wages. Moreover, partially supported by their husbands/boyfriends, women were able to work for lower wages than men, further driving down wages. The benefit to capitalist employers is obvious.

On this view, it is entirely to be expected that the rise of modern feminism coincided with the loss of jobs in heavy industry and manual labour (where male physical strength was at a premium) and the rise of the service sector (to which women workers, with their superior social skills, are arguably better suited) in Western post-industrial economies.

In short, as in orthodox Marxist theory, a shift in the economic base of society determined a concomitant shift in the dominant ideology. Hence, feminism.

Or as Neil Lyndon memorably put it,
“The changes which were taken to be victories of emancipatory spirit among women were all conductive to the development of capitalism… [and] the long march of the left towards the identification of the class which would be the dissolution of all classes had simply resulted in the creation of a larger class of wage slaves required by national and international markets” ([No More Sex War](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/No-more-sex-war%3A-The-failures-of-feminism-Lyndon/0e2e5957ed7af3e72bb893e65038f4da42ec35e5), p. 123).

On this view, rather than revolutionary harbingers of a brave new world of gender equality, feminists, their revolutionary self-image notwithstanding, were little more than 'useful idiots' unwittingly serving the interests of their own (and their husbands) capitalist oppressors. Feminism is thus a form of what Marxists typically term ‘false consciousness’.

570,x8cao0,2022-09-07,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,advice on what to do with my life after a false accusation,"hey everyone. I have made a new account to post this so I can remain anonymous but I’m at the end of my tether and in a really really dark place. 

in early june I was dumped by my girlfriend (we had been dating just under a year) who started dating a new guy immediately after, who they had been friends with for months and although I was kinda suspicious I never voiced my opinions because I didn’t want to appear jealous and wanted her to be happy with her friends. This tore  me apart especially as I went to work with her (we both did an office job) and still saw her basically every day. I had a few close friends at our work who I met up with at lunches and such, and they comforted me in my grief. I also became friends with an ex girlfriend from years ago as I thought I should be more sociable. I told these friends about what happened and how I felt I was treated shit and lacked any form of closure. 

These words were then taken and spread like wildfire with someone ending up telling my ex-girlfriend. My ex girlfriend then must not have liked that people saw her in a bad light so she took to social media and publicly tried to ridicule me saying I was horrible and friends with racists (I am not a sociable person and all my friends were also hers) and also then coming out with that I liked my ex girlfriend the whole time, told me she hopes I kill myself but lastly saying I made her do stuff she didn’t want to. 

I then got cut off by a lot of our mutual friends, and was down to 2 or 3 people who liked me. I also received threats off her new boyfriend saying I would get beaten up. I realised that at this point I could not let people think this so I got in contact and asked them to take it down off social media as they are not providing any evidence but are just putting words out to ruin my reputation. They were taken off social media and I thought that it was over. 

A couple months later I find out they have been contacting people on messages instead of public social media saying I sexually assaulted them and that I was always horrible and manipulative (these things are not true, I always tried my hardest to give her everything I could and make sure she always felt okay whatever the situation. Whenever we would be sexual I would always make sure I asked her consent, and if she said no or changed her mind during I would immediately stop. It was not explained how I was horrible or manipulative either, just saying that I was). After this all my other work colleagues who I thought were friends distanced as they said it’s best to believe the accuser. Luckily I was shown this and again got in contact but I’ve realised that I don’t know how many people would have got these messages so I don’t know how far I have had my reputation ruined, and I know this probably won’t stop anytime soon so I do not know what to do next. I think she had quit the office as she has not come in in months, so I do not have to see her anymore.

I have gathered evidence of the threats I received, and screen shorted every accusation from my ex when I’ve been shown them, which seem to vary in what she says every time she talks about me. 

It has now been months and I am still in an extremely dark place where some days I can’t even pick myself off the floor. I have lost everything (except one outside work friend) including my social life, my work friends, my self esteem and my mental health has totally crumbled. I have not overcome my feelings yet, and with this I doubt I will ever find true closure.

I do not have much money so I do not know what lawyer would be best to go to. I can ask my family for a loan if it comes to it however. I am happy to go to the police but I do not know which is the best method/ action to take next.

Thank you.",InformationFree3296,t2_ruxlwttr,1.0,93,32

It's barely 2024 and I've already dealt with bullshit. For some context I'm only 19 and most of the women I'm around are GenZ. Just this week alone I've already had to deal with this:


I got accused of ""mansplaining"" because a grown woman of 23 didn't know she could use tampons and piss at the same time. I wasn't even rude about it. We were in a group chat and she said she could never use tampons because ""what happens if [she] needs to pee?"" I didn't laugh at her or mock her, I just said ""you can use tampons and pee at the same. You pee from the urethra which is unaffected by the presence of a tampon."" She went feral about said I was ""mansplaining"" female anatomy to her. I didn't respond because what the fuck? It's not my fault that you don't know the difference between your vagina and urethra.


I got accused of abusing my ""male privilege"" by asking for and getting a raise. I work at a grocery store, not a high paying job. I've been working there for two years now and wanted more than what I was getting so I asked. And I got what I wanted, a dollar raise. My female coworker makes $2 less than me now but made $1 less than me before. She's only been working there for about six months and doesn't work as many hours as me (she's also always on her phone and doesn't work as hard). All the employees are open about our salaries and she got pissy with me when I shared my raise. She said something along the lines of ""it's kind of shitty of you to abuse your privilege when you know I already made less than you. This is why the wage gap exists, because men are taking away opportunities from women."" I just explained to her what I told you guys, she hasn't worked as long as me, she works less hours than me, and she's always getting reprimanded for not doing her job correctly. She called me an asshole and is giving me the cold shoulder.


This shit is straight cartoony. It's almost unbelievable. But it's driving me nuts. The world isn't out to get women. Men aren't all scheming and plotting against women. Not everything is about the ""patriarchy"" and not everything is misogynistic. This is especially true if you're living in a first world country. Being educated by a man isn't misogynistic and making less than a man because you don't do the same work is not misogynistic. This is common sense, but I think GenZ is just brainrotted from being online too much. They think Twitter and TikTok is real or some shit.


ETA: Just for some extra context, I am a trans man (FtM) and have been stealth for some time, meaning I live as a cishet man. So I've been on both sides of the fence and I can proudly say that I have not gained any male privilege or male power. I still can't fearlessly walk alone at night because men are mugged and murdered more. I lost my ability to vent and ask for emotional help without coming across as weak. I've lost my ability to speak up when there's women around due to being accused of ""mansplaining"" or something. And now I'm obsessed with my social worth due to men being seen as nothing but war fodder and breadwinners. Obviously being trans isn't a choice and I've had dysphoria since I was a child. But going from Female to Male did feel like a social downgrade.",Unlucky_Signature390,t2_mx73hjsjl,0.96,217,54
572,13axog1,2023-05-07,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,How can we end potential anti-male bias in international humanitarian organizations?,"For example, in resolution 1325, the United Nations Security Council UNANIMOUSLY adopted a resolution ""Expressing concern that civilians, **particularly women and children**, make up the vast majority of those adversely affected by war."" Now, to be fair, they didn't outright say women suffered more, because mathematically, the adverse effects of war on men who are soldiers could be so great that it would make it at least 50-50.  But still, is it really true? Men make up the majority of civilian casualties, and while women may be victim to sexual violence more often, it still has happened a decent amount to men as well. Economically, while men do make more money & it's easier for them to get jobs in some places that are vulnerable to violent unrest, many of them still have to provide for their wife, children, or even elderly, just as women do(though in a different way).   


Furthermore, the ICRC and IFRC both claim that women make up the majority of victims of ""gender-based violence"". I couldn't find any statistics on this, so I wonder: what is gender based violence? Obviously, it's rare for violence to ONLY be influenced by gender. So, it must mean it plays a ROLE, right? So, I imagine they are particularly referring to sexual violence. While men are less likely to experience sexual violence, it's not the only form of violence out there. What about murder, assault causing injury, etc? Are those not often gender-based? With there being many instances of times in war where the women are spared from death(though they often still experience violence, but still generally considered lesser), while the men aren't, and with men making up the majority of victims of all non-sexual violent crimes, what makes that lesser than the level of gender-based violence against women?

&#x200B;

These organizations are all very high-level, though, so how do we change their policies? The UN is run by member states, many of whom are democracies/federal elective republics, so activism could be done at that level. Does anyone have any ideas for that? r/equalitycompass seems good, anything else? But when it comes to non-profits, what can we do? We could contact them, spread research, or create new ones, but that could be harder. If anyone has any ideas, please comment!",Forward-Razzmatazz18,t2_dfsnnlrl,0.98,95,16

* Can other people with less obvious MRA accounts like me i.e. more normal looking accounts, post stuff (this is a general comment, not just for this thread) post this on more mainstream threads e.g. Finland sub, sociology, etc.... MAKE SURE you are polite, factual, avoid emotive language, avoid talking about feminism, and  post high quality stuff
* Comment here particular quotes, passages, excerpts that are relevant. Especially since its such a long document, this will be useful for all of us.
* You can make these excerpts into separate threads if worthy.
* Share this on social media? (set up an anon MRA twitter, Facebook etc... MRA is thriving on social media. It is good as its a lot more activism based)
* If you live in Finland, send some emails to journalists (you can search journalists who have already discussed mens issues), and send some to politicians etc. You can easily write one letter and send it to multiple people. Maybe the individual excerpts/issues you find would be better to send (and then you could also add the whole document summary as an addendum for reference for the reader) - Finland is a small country, I dont think many users will be from there here.
* NOTE: It is good that these issues are being increasingly recognised, and more people are doing this as projects in academia. This is only growing and snowballing as more people are red pilled. Look up Male Psychology Network, they are doing fantastic work, growing and have presented an ALTERNATIVE to patriarchy conspiracy theory and are working to dismantle the idea in academia.

# Main Body - Here it is:

This is a chapter-by-chapter summary of [Discrimination Against Men: Appearance and Causes in the Context of a Modern Welfare State](https://lauda.ulapland.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/61748/Pasi_Malmi_v%C3%A4it%C3%B6skirja.pdf?sequence=1), a 2009 doctoral dissertation by Pasi Malmi (University of Lapland) that provides an impressively detailed and balanced investigation of discrimination against men in Finland (the theory and results actually give almost as much detail on discrimination against women, although men will be the focus here).

Chapters 5 to 8 are the most important. Chapter 5 explains six biases that cause gender discrimination, chapter 6 delineates the patriarchal and matriarchal subsystems of Finnish society, chapter 7 examines the various discourses that justify discrimination against men, and chapter 8 analyzes a database of gender discrimination complaints made to the Finnish gender equality ombudsman, a third of which were made by men.

*(Length: 1,800 words.)*

**Chapters 1 to 4 (introductory/background chapters)**

Chapter 1 situates the perspective taken by the dissertation within gender studies. It rejects anti-feminist and anti-women perspectives, and the glorification of traditional masculinity and gender roles (e.g., the [mythopoetic men’s movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythopoetic_men%27s_movement)). But it also rejects the “critical studies of men” paradigm, which sees men as the main causes of men’s and women’s problems, refuses to criticize feminism or women, and does not believe that discrimination against white, heterosexual, middle-class men exists (pp. 20–21).

Chapter 2 defines various relevant concepts, and explains that the findings from Finland are intended to be relevant primarily for the Northern European welfare states, and secondarily for other European and Anglo-American countries (pp. 32–34).

Chapter 3 gives a brief overview of current or traditional viewpoints on what causes direct or indirect discrimination or mistreatment of men: gender roles, hegemonic masculinity, industrial capitalism, feminism (specifically gender feminism and victimization feminism), and exploitative women (pp. 36-44).

Chapter 4 develops a theory of sociocultural evolution, which says that ideas that are simple, exaggerated, and coherent with popular paradigms generally win out over their rivals, regardless of whether they are true or backed up by evidence. This happens due to functional selection (p. 57), unintentional biases (p. 63), and interest group bias (p. 71), among other factors (see summary, p. 115).

**Chapter 5: Applying the Theory to Gender Discrimination (p. 118)**

This chapter develops a general theory of gender discrimination, centered on a typology of six different biases that cause gender discrimination (p. 127).

The **masculine bias** and **feminine bias** are unintentional gender biases caused by the processes that simplify, exaggerate, and mutate people’s mental memes or ideas according to their gender (p. 127). For example, a person’s conception of domestic work or childcare will be centered on their own experiences or contributions, which are partly determined by their gender, and so they will often downplay/exclude the other gender’s contributions (e.g., yardwork vs. housework) (pp. 135–138). As a result of these biases, segregated groups and networks of men or women tend to have a masculine-biased or feminine-biased culture of values, priorities, concepts, words, stories, jokes, stereotypes and beliefs that can lead to practices that discriminate against the other gender (p. 120). For example, a group of female social workers might decide that women are better custodians of children and default to recommending custody to them (pp. 141–142).

The **masculist bias** and **feminist bias** come from interest groups, networks, or movements seeking to advance the status of men or women, respectively. Masculism and feminism have sexist and anti-sexist branches (p. 143). The modern **sexist branch of feminism** includes theories like *feminist standpoint epistemology* (which gives special status to women’s feelings and intuitions) and the *feminist theory of social work* (interests of women and children are synonymous, social workers should identify with their female customers). It also includes stereotypes that women are unselfish, peaceful, responsible, loving, hard working, while men are the opposite (pp. 149–152). The **anti-sexist branch of feminism** by definition is less hostile towards men as people, but it is not necessarily able or willing to accept men’s issues: “\[i\]n general, the idea of the discrimination of men is perceived as bizarre by feminists” (pp. 155–158). The **sexist branch of masculism** is discussed primarily in the context of religion (pp. 144–129). The **anti-sexist branch of masculism** has little power, although it is discussed as sometimes being the source of biased statistics downplaying women’s issues (pp. 152–155).

The **alpha male bias** and **alpha female bias** are the biases of high status (wealthy, powerful, attractive, etc.) members of each gender against low status members of their gender. They are particularly apparent in high status men’s bias against male criminals (male judges giving harsher treatment, including sentences, to them compared to women) and high status women’s bias against female prostitutes (pp. 170–173).

A central point of this dissertation is that male-dominated and female-dominated organizations (the patriarchal and matriarchal subsystems) are prone to predominantly discriminate against the other gender, but it’s important to clarify that they’re not *guaranteed* to do so. The masculine and feminine biases (the unintentional “own gender” biases) are just two of the six biases. An organization could be more influenced by the ideological biases (masculist and feminist biases) or the biases against low social status people of each gender (alpha male and alpha female biases).

**Chapter 6: Locating the Patriarchal and Matriarchal Subsystems of the Finnish Society (p. 188)**

This chapter identifies Finnish society’s patriarchal and matriarchal subsystems by looking at various measures of power, including raw numbers, managerial positions, control of knowledge, and informal positions of power (p. 222).

* Patriarchal subsystem: technology, commerce, state finances, defense, agriculture, transportation, trade, corporative labor and employer organizations.
* Matriarchal subsystem: healthcare, social services, social policy, equality policy, hotels, restaurants, and some cultural services.

Not all areas of Finnish society fall into one of these subsystems.

**Chapter 7: An Empirical Examination of the Memeplexes, Discourses and Coalitions that Induce Discrimination against Men (p. 224)**

This chapter analyzes the discourses that justify discrimination against men, coming from sources that include sexism and feminism.

**Sexism:** The development of the modern misandric versions of sexism is examined, including 19th century views of men as “barbarians whose urges had to be leashed in by the forces of decency—meaning women—if civilization were to survive” (p. 233), which it attributes to the joint interests of women and upper class men. Notions of chivalry and macho masculinity also lead to institutionalized belief systems where men’s comfort, health, and even lives are considered less important than women’s (p. 238). Macho masculinity, with its aversion to men “complaining”, tends to oppose talking about men’s issues or seeing them as relevant for gender equality (p. 306).

**Feminism:** Certain influential varieties of feminism see women as *the* disadvantaged and discriminated gender (p. 247). Thus the sole purpose of equality policy is women’s advancement (p. 256) and men are largely reduced to the role of defendant (p. 270). When faced with cases requiring a choice between *promotion of equality* and *empowerment of women*, many feminists reacted by rejecting equality as outdated or as a smokescreen for promoting men’s interests over women. Under these discourses, “the empowerment of women is more important than the advancement of gender equality in all contexts, including the matriarchal subsystem of the society” (pp. 259–260). That would apply even to women’s advantage in family courts and criminal courts (p. 305).

Also mentioned is a combination (and mutation) of difference feminism and equality feminism which says that “women are superior to men in many ways, but men are not superior to women in any ways” (p. 296)—which means that when men are ahead it’s because of sexism, but when women are ahead it is legitimate and natural.

**Chapter 8: Gender Discrimination, According to the Complaints Sent to the Finnish Equality Ombudsman (p. 346)**

**Complaints:** This chapter analyzes 800 complaints of gender discrimination made between 1997 and 2004 and sent to the Finnish equality ombudsman (p. 348). Men were 33% of victims, according to the author’s suggestion for the best measure of actual discrimination in these cases (outcome types 3–5, p. 356). Labour market discrimination, the largest category, primarily involved women (76%), while the second largest category, discrimination against customers, primarily involved men (\~60%).

Another category, discriminative legislation, primarily involved men (77%). Few complaints were made, but due to active conscription policies (lasting [5-12 months](http://puolustusvoimat.fi/documents/1948673/2015517/MAAVE-Varusmies-EN-19052017/4baabd0e-7545-428f-8e05-73735cd5817e)), almost all men in Finland are affected by discriminative legislation. The author classifies these complaints as discrimination, although the equality ombudsman does not, “as the Finnish equality law is not applicable to men’s obligatory military service” (p. 354).

**Bias:** Per chapter 6, equality policy itself is in the matriarchal subsystem of equality (e.g., 90% of employees in the equality ombudsman office are female, p. 354). The ombudsman has a policy not to comment on complaints involving custody and divorce, purportedly to not interfere with the court system, but the author suggests that it stems from a bias against men, perhaps due to prioritizing women’s status over equality or wanting to avoid a flood of complaints from men (p. 354). This is made more explicit by another comment from the ombudsman’s office saying that it is not taking action on certain cases of discrimination against men because “the main purpose of the equality law is to improve women’s status especially in the labor market”, suggesting that the law should be applied more strictly to cases of discrimination against women (p. 381).

**Patriarchal & matriarchal subsystems:** 57% of discrimination cases in the matriarchal subsystem of society (as defined in chapter 6) were against men, compared to 31% in neutral domains, and 17% in the patriarchal subsystem of society (p. 358).

**Discrimination examples:** Many cases of discrimination against women (e.g., a workplace that only required women to do extra cleaning tasks on top of their regular duties) are recounted on the same pages but we’ll look at men here.

* **In the labour market:** At a mental hospital, only men were appointed to night shifts (p. 374). At a school, preference was given to hiring female teachers even though men are the “underrepresented” gender (p. 376). Many traditionally feminine jobs excluded men in their recruitment material (p. 377). A workplace allowed women to wear more casual and comfortable clothing than men (p. 377).
* **As customers:** Favourable pricing for women in boat cruises, discotheques & dancing places, dating services, gymnastics, a theatre, restaurants, horse races, and car insurance (pp. 380–382). Also more strict clothing standards for men at a casino, higher minimum ages for men to enter restaurants, and an apartment that only allowed women (pp. 382–383).
* **Government administration:** Subsidy for women’s osteoporosis medicines but not men’s (from pension fund), free public screening for breast cancer but not prostate cancer, higher retirement age for men (which has been changed) (pp. 387–389).
* **Legislation:** Men’s complaints were all about the obligatory military or civil service of six to thirteen months (those who refuse get six months in prison, p. 390).

**Likely motives:** Two alternative rating methods (tables 52 and 53) find that either (certain) feminist ideas are the most common motivators of discrimination against men, or sexism and the feminine bias are the most common motivators (feminine bias meaning unintentional gender bias of groups of women, counterpart to masculine bias of groups of men). Financial motives were also frequent (pp. 401-402).

I recommend reading the report. Here are some of my hi-lights

&#x200B;

**Who has it easier**

* **Men:** 28% of Men, 41% of Women, 19% of Republicans, 49% of Democrats
* **Women;** 14% of Men, 5% of Women, 12% of Republicans, 6% of Democrats
* **About the Same:** 58% of Men, 54% of Women, 68% of Republicans, 45% of Democrats
* Millennial Women are more likely to think Men have it easier compared to Boomer and Gen X Women. Silent Gen Women are less likely to think Men have it easier and more likely to think Women have it easier.
   * No such age correlation among men
* Educated Democrats are significantly more likely to think Men have it Easier compared to uneducated Democrats
   * No such education correlation among republicans
   * Shows the divergence between the educated city socially liberal democrats and more socially centrist / mixed working class democrats

**Why Men Have it Easier? - Top Answers given**

* 43% - ""Better Pay""
   * Wage Gap propaganda (which is really women having the privilege to marry up is still really strong)
* 29% - ""Men have more job opportunities and better workplace treatment""
* 10% - ""Men have less family / household work""
* Some surprises
   * Only 4% cited sexual harassment
   * Only 4% cited physical safety
   * No specific category was given for biology (pregnancy and periods) which is probably the first thing I would say. I think Women have it easier but this is one area I would concede
   * 9% were categorized as other; 8% as general; 16% as non answer / unknown

&#x200B;

**Why Women Have it Easier? - Top Answers given**

* 30% - ""Women have more job opportunities and better workplace treatment
   * True from my experience
   * Seems like a lot of MRA movement is rooted in opposition to affirmative action policies
   * This can be seen by several quotes speaking about ""minority / non-white women"" having privilege
* 9% - ""Laws and courts favour women""
   * This is an objective fact
* 8% - ""Women get believed when they make false accusations of sexual assault / harassment or sexism""
   * Again, pretty clearly true according to me
* Most MRAs I've encountered, especially non-male MRAs, got into it due to divorce or false accusation issues
   * As in, they or someone they knew was a victim of rigged divorce courts or false accusation
* Some surprises

575,10ilj1n,2023-01-22,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Weird inconsistencies in legal evidence of paternity I've noticed as I work to get my son's U.S. citizenship recognized,"I may have mentioned before that I am American and my wife is Mexican, and we live in Mexico with our baby son. He was born in Mexico, so I have applied to the U.S. Embassy for recognition of his U.S. citizenship at birth through me.

The recognition process demands all kinds of documentation to prove the fulfillment of various requirements to pass on U.S. citizenship to the child.

When the U.S. citizen parent is the father, as in our case, not only must he provide the birth certificate showing him as the father, but he must also provide proof of relationship with the mother, in particular proof in the form of timestamped photos and passport stamps, inter alia, that he was in the same place as the mother during or around the time of conception. If the Embassy is not satisfied with this evidence, it will require the US citizen father to order a paternity test. I personally read about a case like this from a member of a Facebook group about the process for obtaining a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (the equivalent of a birth certificate for U.S. citizens born outside the country); she was still living with her ex when she met her now husband (the U.S. citizen parent) and conceived her child with him shortly thereafter, and the latter was ultimately required to provide positive DNA test results to obtain recognition of their son's U.S. citizenship.

I wouldn't find all this unfair if it weren't for the fact that the government regularly goes after men for child support because, .e.g., the mother put his name on the birth certificate without him knowing, or because he had the same name as the person in question (this happened to a man who had only been 10 years old when the child in question was born!), or because a man acted like a father towards a child for a certain period of time (which would not be recognized for the procedure in question by the U.S. Embassy).

If men are constantly imposed paternal *obligations* by law based on very low standards of evidence, shouldn't we be entitled to enjoy those low standards when we exercise our paternal *rights*? If being named on a birth certificate is enough to be required to pay child support, shouldn't it be enough for me to gladly and willingly transfer my citizenship to my son?

Now, one may say that the consular citizenship recognition procedure for my son is a federal matter, while the cases of child support being imposed on men who are clearly not the father are state matters. However, considering that there are federal laws to enforce such unfair child support judgments across state lines, the federal government has clearly endorsed such dubious state-level attributions of paternity and paternal obligations.

Therefore, I think I am right to consider the U.S. federal government hypocritical for demanding mountains of evidence to prove that I am my son's father in order to bequeath him the benefits of my citizenship, since the same federal government would help a state squeeze money out of me for nothing more than my being named as the father on the birth certificate of a child I may not even know.

**ADDENDUM:** I would also argue that this inconsistency shows how the best interests of the child are only applied when it is convenient. If the best interests of the child dictate that the state must falsely attribute paternity to non-fathers when it allows the child to have more material resources, shouldn't they also dictate the same when it allows the child to have a citizenship that will provide him or her with far greater life opportunities than the citizenship already recognized? It seems that principle goes out the window when there's no man being made to suffer, or no man whose resources are to be extracted.",Grow_peace_in_Bedlam,t2_1j7xndf1,0.99,105,32

The Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare, is a United States federal statute enacted by the 111th United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. this creted at least 7 new agencies and departments devoted solely to women while there is not one office for men or male specific ailments. as explain Caroline May in ""[Does Obamacare discriminate against men?](https://dailycaller.com/2010/12/10/does-obamacare-discriminate-against-men/)""

&#x200B;

>Men’s health advocates long have pushed for an Office of Men’s Health to act as a companion to the Office on Women’s Health, established in 1991. Instead of rectifying that disparity, the new health care law intensified it. (until now **there is no Men's Health Office** !!)  
>  
>Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, has been critical of Obama’s gender policies, charging that his administration has **pushed initiatives that favor women over men**. According to Roth, the health care bill was no different.  
>  
>“\[The women’s\] lobby is very well funded, active and vocal. It is really paradoxical because women in many ways are doing better than men, so for example, if you do a search in the health care bill **there is not one mention of ‘prostate’ and are over 40 mentions of ‘breast’ and men are tax payers, they should get equal health treatment**,” Roth told The Daily Caller

>Roth stressed that the high number of women’s agencies and lack of corresponding men’s offices was **not just a symbolic display of inequality, but one that would have real world repercussions, namely in the distribution of research funding**.  
>  
>“People don’t understand that **men on average live about 5 less years than women**. That 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women in their lifetime will be diagnosed with cancer. That **men lead in 9 out of the 10 top ten causes of death**. When you look at the data and the facts it is really not part of the debate in health care and I think those are statistics and facts that need to be brought to light,”

Cassie Jaye the filmmaker of [The Red Pill documentary](http://theredpillmovie.com/) on the men's rights movement needed funding for the post production of her film, so she started searching for non-profits that give grants for humanitarian causes. [she say](https://archive.is/QXMqR) :

>I started to see the bias towards women’s films and against men’s. **There are no categories for men’s films** though there are several for women and minorities. **I submitted the film to human rights categories, and was rejected by all of them**.”

# Women have no power ?

An [OECD report](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers_mark_girls_higher_for_identical_work_to/) on gender in education, across more than 60 countries, found that girls receive higher marks compared with boys of the same ability. Researchers suggest girls are better behaved in class and this influences how teachers perceive their work. Differences in school results can sometimes ""have little to do with ability"", says the study. (teaching is female dominated sector)In [2017 the UK’s then Chief Medical Officer](https://gendemic.co.uk/lack-of-mens-health-strategies-may-have-cost-lives-in-pandemic) Dame Sally Davies (who is a woman) replied to requests from the Men & Boys Coalition to state that she had no plans to conduct an annual report into men’s health, despite having published a detailed and extensive annual report into women’s health strategy in 2015.As explain the Men And Boys Coalition in their article ""[chief medical officer refuses multiple requests to place equal focus on the health of men and women](http://www.menandboyscoalition.org.uk/newsevents/chief-medical-officer-refuses-multiple-requests-to-place-equal-focus-on-the-health-of-men-and-women/)"" :

>**Her refusal follows multiple requests**, first in the form of a joint letter in March 2016 prior to establishment of the Coalition, and then in March 2017 on behalf of the Coalition.  
>  
>The Coalition steering group is particularly concerned by her decision, not only due to the many grave health issues affecting men and boys in the UK that would benefit from the much needed focus such a report would offer, but also because **the CMO has refused to offer any explanation as to why she has chosen not to give equal focus on the health of men** as she rightly has done on the health of women.

Clearly she refused because she is sexist, in another occasion she said she will only hire female doctors to work with her. imagine if a man said that ?

A [proposal](https://archive.is/ije1c) at Simon Fraser University (near Vancouver) to open up a men’s centre on campus (to address issues like suicide, addiction, and negative stereotypes) was opposed by the existing women’s centre.

The [National Union of Students in the UK called](http://www.inside-man.co.uk/2016/05/31/nus-man-problem/) for all LGBT societies to drop the position of gay men’s representative in a motion that also concluded that gay males were the likely perpetrators of sexism, racism and transphobia. This assertion wasn’t backed up by facts and figures or even anecdotal testimony. The NUS is controled by women, for example committee member Sarah Noble who last year was suspended from the Liberal Democrats for Tweeting her desire to ""**kill all men**"". Sorana Vieru who in September Tweeted: ""**I’m no fan of cis white men**"". Shelly Asquith said she was **repulsed at having to ""face disgusting men**"" on her commute to work.

Between 2007 and May 2009 (the recession) nearly 80 percent of the job loss had been held by men. but when the government wanted to help male dominated industries they faced a backlash from the women's groups. as explain Christina Hoff Sommers in her article [No Country for Burly Men](https://archive.is/A0j1u): How feminist groups skewed the Obama stimulus plan towards women's jobs.

>**Men are bearing the brunt of the current economic crisis because they predominate in manufacturing and construction, the hardest-hit sectors**, which have lost more than 3 million jobs since December 2007. Women, by contrast, are a majority in recession-resistant fields such as education and health care, which gained 588,000 jobs during the same period. Rescuing hundreds of thousands of unemployed crane operators, welders, production line managers, and machine setters was never going to be easy. But the concerted **opposition of several powerful women's groups** has made it all but impossible. Consider what just happened with the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  
>  
>Women's groups were appalled. Grids? Dams? Opinion pieces immediately appeared in major newspapers with titles like ""Where are the New Jobs for Women?"" and ""The Macho Stimulus Plan."" A group of ""notable feminist economists"" circulated a petition that quickly garnered more than 600 signatures, calling on the president-elect to add projects in health, child care, education, and social services and to ""institute apprenticeships"" to train women for ""at least one third"" of the infrastructure jobs. At the same time, more than 1,000 feminist historians signed an open letter urging Obama not to favor a ""heavily male-dominated field"" like construction: ""We need to rebuild not only concrete and steel bridges but also human bridges."" As soon as these groups became aware of each other, they formed an anti-stimulus plan action group called WEAVE-- Women's Equality Adds Value to the Economy.  
>  
>The senior economists listened attentively as Gandy and Smeal and other advocates argued for a stimulus package that would add jobs for nurses, social workers, teachers, and librarians in our crumbling ""human infrastructure"" (they had found their testosterone-free slogan). **Did Furman mention that jobs in the ""human infrastructure""--health, education, and government--had increased by more than half a million since December 2007?**

Clearly saying women have no power is stupid. women as a class have a lot of power. men's rights groups are considered hate groups by the mainstream media. and men's voices are considered illegitimate when talking on gender issues.

**Only a sexist deny the existence of sexism against men:**

Denying the existence of sexism against men is an example of sexism, no one deny sexism against women. but with all the evidences of institutional sexism against men some people still say misandry is not real ?! these are just few examples i can give you one million example  in all countries and in all areas of life.

577,vybqmg,2022-07-13,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Some common gender myths and their rebuttals,"It seems like the same discussions come up around Reddit a lot, so I figured I'd gather up some common topics, and their rebuttals.

Many of these arguments can be expanded with more points and sources but I'm trying to keep this as compact and to the point as possible.

####Myth 1: ""Sexism against men is never institutional or systematic""

Many forms of sexism and discrimination against men are *explicitly* institutionalized or systemic in society.

Examples include police violence, court biases, incarceration, child custody discrimination, military service, educational biases, health research and spending, insurance, housing discrimination, reproductive rights, bodily autonomy rights, and many others.

The widespread ignorance and denialism around these issues can itself be interpreted as a form of systemic discrimination against men as well.

Note that some of these are institutional because they boil down to statutory legal rights which exist in the realm of government policy and administration.  And the government is obviously an institution.

#### Myth 2: ""Most politicians and CEOs are men, and this has led to a society that privileges men and disenfranchises women""

The fact that many positions of formal power are occupied by men does not translate into measurable privileges for the average man.

The assumption this is based on is the idea that men have an in-group bias and prefer other men over women.

Which is an idea that has been debunked over and over again in the academic literature.  The gender bias among men is almost zero, and sometimes manifests as an out-group bias sightly in favor of women, not other men.

In-group bisses do exist among women though.  In fact some research has found evidence for very strong gender biases among women.  Including when it comes to educators, bosses, and hiring managers.  Women in formal positions of power do actually seem to prefer other women over men, in much the same way that men are accused of behaving. So maybe this is just projection: people who themselves have gender biases assume that everyone else does as well.

####Myth 3: ""Women were uniquely oppressed in history compared to men""

Much like today, sexism in history was often two sides of the same coin.  If it was unfair that women had to stay home and take care of their children then it was also unfair that men had to work long hours outside the comfort of their homes.  Many people try to equate sexism to the history of racism, as if men were unilaterally oppressing women for their own benefit. And that's simply not an accurate view of history (nor is it a very healthy belief to have).  

Gender norms were often unfair to women. But for most of history, women could own property, get divorced (where they usually took most of their husband's money), run businesses, and even be heads of state.  Many large empires were ran by women, for example.

The reality of the situation though is that pregnancy (and breastfeeding) often dictated the need for women to have men supporting them. Birth control and baby formula didn't exist. So your options were basically abstinence, or marriage. Which was the same choice that men also had.

**""What about voting rights?""**

Voting rights were historically tied to military service and the draft. It was never something that men got ""for free"" just for being men.

In England, most men couldn't vote until 1918, and that was only because they instituted a draft for all men during WWI.

Women aged 30 and older were also given the right to vote in 1918, and this came without the same obligation to serve in the military that men had.  Women over 21 were given voting rights just 10 years later in 1928, which was the same age that men could vote.  And that temporary age difference had a practical purposes: so many men died in WW1 that there was a need to even out the gender ratio.

So men have been allowed to vote for a whopping 10 years longer than women, *at most*.  And that was only because of the mass, involuntary slaughter that they experienced around the world during WW1.

Other obligations that men had were paying taxes, attending caucuses, and signing up for bucket bridges to fight fires.

It took a few decades in some parts of the world for people to decide that it was fair for women to be able to vote without giving anything back to the state, but I think it's important to understand the context here. It wasn't misogyny or oppression but political theory.  Specifically the question of whether or not it was fair to give women voting rights without equivalent responsibilities that were required from men (something known as a [moral hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard), and that can be contextualized as *""female privilege also sometimes harming women""*).

####Myth 4: ""Domestic violence and sexual assault are primarily women's issues""

Domestic violence and sexual assault affects everyone, and at nearly identical rates between men and women.

In the US, roughly 37.3% of women have been victims of domestic violence, stalking, sexual harassment, and sexual abuse.  Including 1.4 million women who experience sexual assault annually.

For men that same figure is 30.9%. Including 1.7 million men who experience sexually assault annually (defined as ""made to penetrate"").  The vast majority of these men are also victimized by women, not by ""other men"" (which is another myth).

This pattern is similar across the world, including in poor and underdeveloped nations (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/koinom/some_sources_on_the_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys/) for a collection of studies), and is consistent with a wide range of research demonstrating ""gender parity"" between men and women for this topic.

https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf

http://webshare.law.ucla.edu/Faculty/bibs/stemple/Stemple-SexualVictimizationPerpetratedFinal.pdf

https://1in6.org

It's also not true that there's a significant difference in severity between male and female victims.  Around 66% of intimate partner homicides do have women as victims (which is hardly a staggering majority), but when you include intimate partner related suicide deaths (including assisted suicides), a greater number of men are killed because of domestic violence than women.  These statistic also ignore the fact that lesbian relationships are more violent than heterosexual and gay male relationships.  Which inflates these numbers and doesn't necessarily back up the idea that women are being uniquely victimized by men.

We should obviously work to fight against abuse in any form, but our current, gendered approach to this doesn't seem to be helping very much.  It is also commonly used as an excuse for misandry.  Many people who discuss abuse against women do not actually care about female victims.  All they care about is advancing a culture of hatred and sexism against men.

**""But women are afraid to walk down dark alleyways at night!""**

As they should.  And as do men.  Most violent crime targets men. And fear is subjective. This is hardly evidence of some kind of unique oppression against women (at least one that doesn't also affect men), and it ignores the fact that men are usually afraid of finding themselves in those same situations as well.

Men are stronger and more capable of defending themselves so I wouldn't blame someone for having gendered views or assumptions here.  But let's try not to minimize male victimization or blame it on things like ""male oppression"".

####Myth 5: ""False allegations are extremely rare""

Multiple studies have found alarmingly high rates of false allegations in society.

As many as 1 in 7 men have been falsely accused at some point in their life, and they often have to live with those allegations even after proving their innocence.

In addition, around 1 in 20 women have also been falsely accused at some point during their life.

False allegations are particularly common when it comes to child custody and divorce, where well over half of all allegations have been estimated to be false.  There is also a common racial element that targets minority men.  Especially in history during the era of lynchings in the US.

####Myth 6: ""Men commit suicide more often than women, but women still *attempt* suicide more often than men""

This idea has its origins with faulty hospital reporting which lumps suicide attempts in with self-harm (which is something that's more common among women).  Women are also more likely to report their suicide attempts than men. And even if this statistic were accurate, it ignores the obvious fact that a suicide survivor can attempt again, thus artificially inflating this statistic.

The fact is, most suicid deaths are men, and most evidence points to there being more unique attempts by men. Any evidence that men are ""better"" at it than women has been interpreted as evidence for greater motivation of success, due to the very same factors that lead them to attempt suicide to begin with. Not as evidence that women are somehow attempting suicide at rates similar to men in the background.

####Myth 7: ""Men make more money because of their gender, and this is evidence of male privilege""

Existing gender norms encourage men to earn money in order to meet the financial demands that are placed on them by women.

This causes them to work harder and sacrifice more for their careers than women. Which they do in part because their income is tied to how successful they are with women, and whether or not they qualify as ""marriage material"".

The wage gap is therefore an example of a gender norm that harms men just as much as it does women.

92% of workplace deaths are men. Men work on average an extra 4 to 10 hours a week (depending on your source) than women. They start working at a younger age (often skirting child labor laws). They retire later (which is also during their peak earning years). And they die sooner than women. Men have worse health outcomes than women and that's largely because of the pressures that society puts on them to be successful and earn money to spend on women.

This is the other side of the wage gap that is equally as important, and that is equally as harmfully to men as it is to women. And it's really just the tip of the iceberg.

In many ways the wage gap is just a reflection of the financial exploitation of men in society.  Which is facilitated by things like hypergamy and unfair marriage and divorce practices.

####Myth 8: ""Men don't go to the doctor because of toxic masculinity""

The main reason that men sometimes don't seek help is a lack of time to see a doctor.

Men work longer hours than women at jobs that are less flexible, and more stressful, than jobs that women usually work at. [Men overall engage in an extra hour of paid and unpaid labor per day compared to women](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/ft_18-05-01_fathersday_time/), and an extra 45 minutes commuting to jobs that are further away. Meaning men on average have quite a bit less free time to go see a doctor than women do.

This is also something that changes during retirement: retired men are just as likely to go to the doctor as retired women.

https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e003320

A general lack of help and support, especially financial support, for men who need medical help also contributes to this.  There is a myth that men are better taken care of than women which has resulted in gendered policies that help women, but exclude men.  Even though it's men who often need that help more.

####Myth 9: ""Men don't speak up about sexism as much as women, so it's obviously not as big of an issue""

This is because people are less likely to care or listen to them. In part because many men who do speak up are silenced and accused of being misogynistic. A situation known as testimonial injustice or [epistemic oppression](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-epistemic-oppression/).

Men are told to keep quiet and many end up internalizing the idea that only women can be discriminated against, since this is what society tells us to believe.  Instead, men often adopt different terminology when they discuss gender issues.  Like referring to differences in treatment between men and women as ""double standards"" instead of sexism or discrimination.

####Myth 10: ""Most men's issues are caused by men themselves""

Most men's issues are caused by gender norms and those gender norms are enforced by women just as much as they are by men.

Men's issues are often just one side of the coin, and usually reflect disadvantages that women face as well.

One of the biggest gender norms in society is hypergamy, or the tendency for women to try to marry up, and for men to marry down.  And this gender norm is mostly enforced by women, not by men.

Two other gender norm that are enforced by women is the providership gender norm, and the childcare gender norm. Which also causes women to perform more unpaid work and earn less money than men in the labor market.

A fourth gender norm that is enforced by women more than men is the ""boys don't cry bias"". Which is mainly instilled in young boys by their mothers and by female school teachers.  In fact, fathers and actually fight against this gender norm.

####Myth 11: ""Toxic masculinity is harming men and their mental health""

The concept of toxic masculinity has never been empirically tested, and some research questions the validity of it in the context of psychology and mental health.

Even if you do think it is valid though, it is still commonly used in a way that is sexist and hateful torwards men.

In recent years it has become associated with female supremacy, feminist hostility towards men, and misandry in general.  And as a result, the vast majority of men find the term to be sexist and offensive.

Men who identify with traditional masculine values have greater self-esteem, better mental health, better relationships with women, and are usually better educated than men who are opposed to masculinity or who accept feminist views about the patriarchy and toxic masculinity.

The key to better mental health for men might therefore be an embracement of masculinity, not a shunning of it.  Instead of trying to redefine masculinity, we should work to understand it better, and offer men better services based on an honest acknowledgement that men's and women's mental health might require different approaches.

Men are not ""defective women"", and treating men's mental health in that context does not seem to be working very well.

####Myth 12: ""Most men's activists just hate women or are opposed to feminism.  They don't really care about men.""

This rhetoric is normally used to silence the voices of men (and women) who support men's rights and prevent them from expressing themselves.  Which makes it another example of testimonial injustice or epistemic oppression.

The fact is that many people do care about men's issues, and that's why they become MRAs.  Feminism does get discussed in the men's movement, but there are a couple reasons for that:

1. Many feminists, ""radical"" or otherwise, have advocated against men and have even pushed for public policy in ways that are harmful to men or discriminates against men. Feminists themselves tend to not fight against this, meaning it's often up to MRAs to address it.

2. Many MRAs are themselves current or ex-feminists who were ostracized for daring to take the feminist rhetoric about *""also caring about men""* a little too seriously.

Warren Farrell is a great example of this. He used to be on the board of directors for NOW, the world's largest feminist organization.

And then he said that we need to work on child custody equality and reproductive rights for men. Topics that he assumed should fall under the umbrella of feminism since they are issues pertaining to gender equality.  Instead of agreeing with him though, he ended up being excommunicated from the feminist movement. And now he's often regarded as the ""father of the modern men's movement"" for carrying on his advocacy outside of feminism.

The problem that many MRAs have with feminism is that it usually stops half way when advocating for gender equality.

So sometimes what MRAs are doing is just taking it the rest of the way towards actual gender equality. Our frustration with feminists comes from the fact that they refuse to see this as valid (or do it themselves to begin with).

####Myth 13: ""Men don't receive custody of their children because they're bad fathers and don't bother requesting custody""

Academic research simply does not back this up.  [The only study that ever found something like this was discovered to be purposefully fraudulent](http://www.breakingthescience.org/SJC_GBC_analysis_intro.php), although that hasn't stopped people from trying to repeat this. The fact is that men are widely discriminated against on numerous different fronts when it comes to child custody and other areas involving family court law.  

Note also how hateful this rhetoric is.  This is the kind of stuff that you find repeated by feminists, and it simply doesn't treat this topic in a fair and honest manner.  Fathers love their children and many fight tooth and nail just to get a few hours a week to spend with them. The system is broken and it represents a grave social injustice that is deeply unfair to fathers and their children.

####Myth 14: ""Most child abusers are men""

A majority of child abuse is actually committed by women, and especially by mothers.  This is even more true when you include emotional abuse and neglect instead of just physical abuse.

By some metrics, the biological father is the safest person for a child to be with. This is because when men do abuse children, it often happens while under the custody of the mother.  Who is sometimes complicit in the abuse or even encourages it.

Close to half of child abductors and traffickers are also women, not men.  And many of their victims are boys.  Boys face sexual abuse and are also used for forced labor and organ harvesting. They are less likely to survive or escape, are less likely to be reported on or identified, and they suffer from higher rates of abuse than girls who are trafficked.

And yet very little attention is given to this.  Missing boys, and especially missing minority boys, are often ignored by society and the media. To the point that people often assume that most of the victims are girls.  Something which is known as the [missing white woman syndrome](https://archive.is/mRIJL) (in Canada there is also a lot of attention given to missing indigenous women, even though 71% of missing indigenous people are men and boys).

Note that I'm not saying these things to attack women, imply that they shouldn't receive custody, or to downplay the plight of girls.  Which is a lot more than you can say about people who try to paint men as the villains in this picture.  We should however be fair about what the facts are, and give male victimization, including victimization by women, the attention that it deserves.

*Fair is fair and equal is equal.  Gender equality will never be fixed if we refuse to look at both sides of the coin.  We need to be honest about what the problems are, and stop ignoring them when they involve men, fathers, and boys.*",Oncefa2,t2_15it3r,0.99,184,51

579,16owcol,2023-09-22,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Concerning the anti-LGBTQ+ protests in Canada this week,"There were big protests this week across Canada, and these ones were really pretty bad. People with signs against surgery on children, etc. Trans people deserve to live, and to be able to live the way they need to. Trans people should be the ones who decide about what happens to trans people, because they're the ones who understand. We need to talk about these protests, though. There are also some coherent messages in amongst all the angry ones.

My belief is that right now the protesters don't have the concepts and language they need to get their point across, so instead it's just anger and queer people are an easy target. We're still trying to address contemporary issues within a framework from the 1970s.

It's not that the subject of LGBTQ+ issues can't be discussed. It's that the classrooms are decorated with rainbow flags and gender is one of the foremost things in the curriculum. The teachers are describing a real problem, but they also propose a very one-sided, solipsistic and dogmatic solution. The workplace is hostile to anyone with different views - that's not conspiracy speak, it's a very real current issue.

Imagine if a bunch of priests showed up in the classrooms, decorated everything with crosses, doves and the Sacred Heart, gave special attention to students who speak about Jesus, then when people complain they say ""we're just teaching about Love"".

That's what people see happening today, just the belief system is different, it's one that uses LGBTQ+ acceptance as a shield against outside criticism. The thing is that it's a belief system that brings a lot of other values and judgements about society. One that is very negative about traditional religion and is honestly pretty xenophobic. They want diversity but only when the diverse people believe the same things they do. I think that when someone posits themselves to be above criticism, that means they are badly in need of criticism.

They behave as if they have a monopoly on LGBTQ+ acceptance, which in and of itself is problematic. Is it possible to be gay without the Rainbow Flag? People have a hard time conceiving of a tolerant world-view other than this one, but it's entirely possible for that to exist if it's allowed to.

Censorship is widespread. There is censorship within feminism and also censorship outside of it. It's normal that people don't recognize the censorship, that's why it works. People have a hard time imagining someone making a positive contribution who comes at the issues from a different angle - because those angles never get seen or heard, they don't make it through the filter; people like me are invisible in all of this.

There's an ongoing story right now of the school boards making new rules about library books. One school threw out all the books published before 2008. I don't trust activists in the school boards to decide what teenagers can and can't read, especially given that the publishing industry works with similar biases right now.

It's a big question, how do we get LGBTQ+ rights without such polarization. I believe that if people were allowed to discuss these issues and question the dogma in different ways without being so harshly criticized, there would be more options for people to choose from and, ironically, in the end there would be fewer people drawn to extremism and more tolerance for actual diversity. I want multi-culturalism, not this weird unilateral definition of inclusion and equality.

I believe you could win over a lot of people, make people more tolerant, if supporting LGBTQ+ rights didn't bring with it so much cultural baggage and so much resentment of ""traditional culture"".

This particular protest has a lot to disagree with, but in its core the dispute is about a contemporary version of the separation of church and state. Rainbow Flag Culture is in the same place right now as the Catholic Church in the 19th century, teaching a specific flavour of morality in the schools. And yea- they're right about a lot of things but they are very wrong about a lot of things too. The people being protested against have repeatedly shown themselves incapable of seeing their own flaws.

These protests are in response to what people saw their children being taught during COVID. They got an inside glance on the classrooms and discovered that the teachers all share a certain political ideology. These teachers are in a privileged position. I saw someone's sign that says ""Tired of being held hostage by the ALPHABET COMMUNITY."" I wish it wasn't the case but I have a hard time disagreeing with that. My belief is that actual LBGTQ+ people are the scapegoats in this situation and a lot of them are tired of being spoken for.",symbolic_poet_guy,t2_ijz8eklkd,0.73,23,19

Who is at the bottom? Who are the most homeless? By roughly 3:1 it's men who are homeless. If we provide for the homeless with living wage jobs, healthcare, housing, we are helping men. Male advocacy means I am an advocate for the homeless. Not only that but men are underserved even in places where medical care is provided for free, they still live years less than women and there needs to be more work and money put into the longevity of men. White women live over 11 years longer than black men and that's not acceptable. There is more to this than just medical but it's absolutely a place needing help.

Who has the most needs for improved safety and working environment? Overwhelmingly it's men working dangerous jobs. It's men driving taxis, working in mines, felling trees, welding, and it's men who are [over 90% of workplace deaths](https://www.statista.com/statistics/187127/number-of-occupational-injury-deaths-in-the-us-by-gender-since-2003/). Saving workers from death and from injury is in my agenda as a male advocate.

Who has the pressure to provide financially for others to build a family? Men. Women have a much greater opportunity to marry up economically and build a family. Under our society (which is problematic already) it's men who are seen as having to provide. So when a man is making $7.25/hr, is he able to have a family? No, that is simply not enough money. Not even enough for himself.

Can a woman have a family, or even provide for herself on $7.25 an hour? No! Can some women date and marry up? Yes. But if all these men are making low wages too, there aren't enough for all of them, especially when the high earning women also want high earning men! 

Neither men nor women are making enough money!  Even the push $15/hr minimum wage in the US is becoming outdated, it was first getting a large push in 2015. [CEOs get paid more](https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/14/investing/ceo-employee-pay-afl-cio-report/index.html) and stock markets and wealth keeps getting bigger for the people at the top, yet wages have not been increasing. Not just at the bottom but in the middle too!

Who dies in wars? Who fights in wars? Men. Men. Who does America kill? A bunch of muslim men in the middle east. Over one million total for combatant and civilians, another hundred thousand or so civilian women. Do we stand for this? NO! Do we want our soldiers dying for Americas imperialism? NO! Do we want to murder hundreds of thousands more innocent middle eastern men? NO!

Are we intersectional? Yes. People say mens advocates are white supremacists and such? Bullshit, not me. Not us. Homeless and poor and medical needers overall are disproportionately lgbt, minority, disabled, and we care for all of them. This is *not* a ""straight white male"" club. Demonization of black men, outcasting of autistic men, hatred of gay men, erasure of trans men, war killing of muslim men, and more are all things we do not stand for.

(Let me clarify intersectional. It does not mean that we believe straight WASP men are the problem, nor the same intersectional beliefs feminism has. It means we recognize many problems that exist or are worse for certain men, such as stated above. I'm ears on if there is a better word to describe this.)

We recognize the problems men and boys face in society and want to put an end to it. We don't want women to suffer economic and social plights, but while they have the giant political arm of feminism helping them we have nothing working for us and need to push our movement.

However, let's look at the real case of wage gap. Mainly minimum wage jobs.

 - Stores, especially Supermarkets. Women do cash; Men do stock. Equal pay. Men face much tougher working conditions
 - Fast Food Restaurants. Women do cash; Men cook in a hot fryer. Equal pay. Men face much tougher working conditions
 - Full serve Restaurants and Bars. Women get higher tips

Now let's look at Office Jobs:

 - In offices, women are held to lower standards of professional dress, which signals that they are held to lower standards in general.
 - Affirmative Action / Quotas / Employment Equity means it is significantly easier for women to find work and get promoted


And of course, while Women have higher earning potential, they also get spent on by Men. Most egregiously by OnlyFans types who get money for  showing some skin but in general.

These are usually two reasons. My question here is. Why is it that when men don't interact with women, why does it have to be based on a negative reason all the time? I mean do fear and porn always have to be the reason. I'm not saying those reasons are not valid. But I mean women already this lol. I'm sure most women don't approach men outside the bare minimum things like asking for directions or help at a particular job. So why are people not counting other factors as to why men aren't approaching women?

In today's society, there is less pressure on people to be in relationships or even get married. Maybe this plays a role in men not approaching women. And you can make an argument for the patriarchy too, by saying how the patriarchy put pressure on men to attract women. This is why I always find it hilarious when I see women being the ones complaining about this issue of men not approaching women.

So wouldn't this make for a better society, where most women can feel safer? And also men aren't pressured to perform gender roles. Albeit I heard some feminists say men avoiding women, can lead to not giving women opportunities in particular jobs, or excluding them from important work projects. Sure this would be bad. But then again there will always be a bare minimum when it comes to interactions between men and women. And maybe work interactions would be that bare minimum.",Vegetable_Camera5042,t2_g81uunw2y,0.98,96,56
584,jrxqld,2020-11-11,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,An Excellent comprehensive PHD Research on Discrimination Against Men in Finland (applicable elsewhere of course). See This post for summary,"[https://becauseits2015.wordpress.com/2017/10/22/comprehensive-research-on-discrimination-against-men-in-finland/](https://becauseits2015.wordpress.com/2017/10/22/comprehensive-research-on-discrimination-against-men-in-finland/)

This is a chapter-by-chapter summary of [*Discrimination Against Men: Appearance and Causes in the Context of a Modern Welfare State*](https://lauda.ulapland.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/61748/Pasi_Malmi_v%C3%A4it%C3%B6skirja.pdf?sequence=1),  a 2009 doctoral dissertation by Pasi Malmi (University of Lapland) that  provides an impressively detailed and balanced investigation of  discrimination against men in Finland (the theory and results actually  give almost as much detail on discrimination against women, although men  will be the focus here).

Chapters 5 to 8 are the most important. Chapter 5 explains six biases  that cause gender discrimination, chapter 6 delineates the patriarchal  and matriarchal subsystems of Finnish society, chapter 7 examines the  various discourses that justify discrimination against men, and chapter 8  analyzes a database of gender discrimination complaints made to the  Finnish gender equality ombudsman, a third of which were made by men.

*(Length: 1,800 words.)*

**Chapters 1 to 4 (introductory/background chapters)**

Chapter 1 situates the perspective taken by the dissertation within  gender studies. It rejects anti-feminist and anti-women perspectives,  and the glorification of traditional masculinity and gender roles (e.g.,  the [mythopoetic men’s movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythopoetic_men%27s_movement)).  But it also rejects the “critical studies of men” paradigm, which sees  men as the main causes of men’s and women’s problems, refuses to  criticize feminism or women, and does not believe that discrimination  against white, heterosexual, middle-class men exists (pp. 20–21).

Chapter 2 defines various relevant concepts, and explains that the  findings from Finland are intended to be relevant primarily for the  Northern European welfare states, and secondarily for other European and  Anglo-American countries (pp. 32–34).

Chapter 3 gives a brief overview of current or traditional viewpoints  on what causes direct or indirect discrimination or mistreatment of  men: gender roles, hegemonic masculinity, industrial capitalism,  feminism (specifically gender feminism and victimization feminism), and  exploitative women (pp. 36-44).

Chapter 4 develops a theory of sociocultural evolution, which says  that ideas that are simple, exaggerated, and coherent with popular  paradigms generally win out over their rivals, regardless of whether  they are true or backed up by evidence. This happens due to functional  selection (p. 57), unintentional biases (p. 63), and interest group bias  (p. 71), among other factors (see summary, p. 115).

**Chapter 5: Applying the Theory to Gender Discrimination (p. 118)**

This chapter develops a general theory of gender discrimination,  centered on a typology of six different biases that cause gender  discrimination (p. 127).

The **masculine bias** and **feminine bias**  are unintentional gender biases caused by the processes that simplify,  exaggerate, and mutate people’s mental memes or ideas according to their  gender (p. 127). For example, a person’s conception of domestic work or  childcare will be centered on their own experiences or contributions,  which are partly determined by their gender, and so they will often  downplay/exclude the other gender’s contributions (e.g., yardwork vs.  housework) (pp. 135–138). As a result of these biases, segregated groups  and networks of men or women tend to have a masculine-biased or  feminine-biased culture of values, priorities, concepts, words, stories,  jokes, stereotypes and beliefs that can lead to practices that  discriminate against the other gender (p. 120). For example, a group of  female social workers might decide that women are better custodians of  children and default to recommending custody to them (pp. 141–142).

The **masculist bias** and **feminist bias**  come from interest groups, networks, or movements seeking to advance  the status of men or women, respectively. Masculism and feminism have  sexist and anti-sexist branches (p. 143). The modern **sexist branch of feminism** includes theories like *feminist standpoint epistemology* (which gives special status to women’s feelings and intuitions) and the *feminist theory of social work*  (interests of women and children are synonymous, social workers should  identify with their female customers). It also includes stereotypes that  women are unselfish, peaceful, responsible, loving, hard working, while  men are the opposite (pp. 149–152). The **anti-sexist branch of feminism** by  definition is less hostile towards men as people, but it is not  necessarily able or willing to accept men’s issues: “\[i\]n general, the  idea of the discrimination of men is perceived as bizarre by feminists”  (pp. 155–158). The **sexist branch of masculism** is discussed primarily in the context of religion (pp. 144–129). The **anti-sexist branch of masculism** has  little power, although it is discussed as sometimes being the source of  biased statistics downplaying women’s issues (pp. 152–155).

The **alpha male bias** and **alpha female bias**  are the biases of high status (wealthy, powerful, attractive, etc.)  members of each gender against low status members of their gender. They  are particularly apparent in high status men’s bias against male  criminals (male judges giving harsher treatment, including sentences, to  them compared to women) and high status women’s bias against female  prostitutes (pp. 170–173).

A central point of this dissertation is that male-dominated and  female-dominated organizations (the patriarchal and matriarchal  subsystems) are prone to predominantly discriminate against the other  gender, but it’s important to clarify that they’re not *guaranteed*  to do so. The masculine and feminine biases (the unintentional “own  gender” biases) are just two of the six biases. An organization could be  more influenced by the ideological biases (masculist and feminist  biases) or the biases against low social status people of each gender  (alpha male and alpha female biases).

**Chapter 6: Locating the Patriarchal and Matriarchal Subsystems of the Finnish Society (p. 188)**

This chapter identifies Finnish society’s patriarchal and matriarchal  subsystems by looking at various measures of power, including raw  numbers, managerial positions, control of knowledge, and informal  positions of power (p. 222).

&#x200B;

* Patriarchal subsystem: technology, commerce, state finances,  defense, agriculture, transportation, trade, corporative labor and  employer organizations.
* Matriarchal subsystem: healthcare, social services, social policy,  equality policy, hotels, restaurants, and some cultural services.

Not all areas of Finnish society fall into one of these subsystems.

**Chapter 7: An Empirical Examination of the Memeplexes, Discourses and Coalitions that Induce Discrimination against Men (p. 224)**

This chapter analyzes the discourses that justify discrimination  against men, coming from sources that include sexism and feminism.

**Sexism:** The development of the modern misandric  versions of sexism is examined, including 19th century views of men as  “barbarians whose urges had to be leashed in by the forces of  decency—meaning women—if civilization were to survive” (p. 233), which  it attributes to the joint interests of women and upper class men.  Notions of chivalry and macho masculinity also lead to institutionalized  belief systems where men’s comfort, health, and even lives are  considered less important than women’s (p. 238). Macho masculinity, with  its aversion to men “complaining”, tends to oppose talking about men’s  issues or seeing them as relevant for gender equality (p. 306).

**Feminism:** Certain influential varieties of feminism see women as *the*  disadvantaged and discriminated gender (p. 247). Thus the sole purpose  of equality policy is women’s advancement (p. 256) and men are largely  reduced to the role of defendant (p. 270). When faced with cases  requiring a choice between *promotion of equality* and *empowerment of women*,  many feminists reacted by rejecting equality as outdated or as a  smokescreen for promoting men’s interests over women. Under these  discourses, “the empowerment of women is more important than the  advancement of gender equality in all contexts, including the  matriarchal subsystem of the society” (pp. 259–260). That would apply  even to women’s advantage in family courts and criminal courts (p. 305).

Also mentioned is a combination (and mutation) of difference feminism  and equality feminism which says that “women are superior to men in  many ways, but men are not superior to women in any ways” (p. 296)—which  means that when men are ahead it’s because of sexism, but when women  are ahead it is legitimate and natural.

The groups and alliances that justify misandry and discrimination against men (p. 334):

**Chapter 8: Gender Discrimination, According to the Complaints Sent to the Finnish Equality Ombudsman (p. 346)**

**Complaints:** This chapter analyzes 800 complaints of  gender discrimination made between 1997 and 2004 and sent to the Finnish  equality ombudsman (p. 348). Men were 33% of victims, according to the  author’s suggestion for the best measure of actual discrimination in  these cases (outcome types 3–5, p. 356). Labour market discrimination,  the largest category, primarily involved women (76%), while the second  largest category, discrimination against customers, primarily involved  men (\~60%).

Another category, discriminative legislation, primarily involved men  (77%). Few complaints were made, but due to active conscription policies  (lasting [5-12 months](http://puolustusvoimat.fi/documents/1948673/2015517/MAAVE-Varusmies-EN-19052017/4baabd0e-7545-428f-8e05-73735cd5817e)),  almost all men in Finland are affected by discriminative legislation.  The author classifies these complaints as discrimination, although the  equality ombudsman does not, “as the Finnish equality law is not  applicable to men’s obligatory military service” (p. 354).

**Bias:** Per chapter 6, equality policy itself is in  the matriarchal subsystem of equality (e.g., 90% of employees in the  equality ombudsman office are female, p. 354). The ombudsman has a  policy not to comment on complaints involving custody and divorce,  purportedly to not interfere with the court system, but the author  suggests that it stems from a bias against men, perhaps due to  prioritizing women’s status over equality or wanting to avoid a flood of  complaints from men (p. 354). This is made more explicit by another  comment from the ombudsman’s office saying that it is not taking action  on certain cases of discrimination against men because “the main purpose  of the equality law is to improve women’s status especially in the  labor market”, suggesting that the law should be applied more strictly  to cases of discrimination against women (p. 381).

**Patriarchal & matriarchal subsystems:** 57% of  discrimination cases in the matriarchal subsystem of society (as defined  in chapter 6) were against men, compared to 31% in neutral domains, and  17% in the patriarchal subsystem of society (p. 358).

**Discrimination examples:** Many cases of  discrimination against women (e.g., a workplace that only required women  to do extra cleaning tasks on top of their regular duties) are  recounted on the same pages but we’ll look at men here.

* **In the labour market:** At a mental hospital, only  men were appointed to night shifts (p. 374). At a school, preference was  given to hiring female teachers even though men are the  “underrepresented” gender (p. 376). Many traditionally feminine jobs  excluded men in their recruitment material (p. 377). A workplace allowed  women to wear more casual and comfortable clothing than men (p. 377).
* **As customers:** Favourable pricing for women in boat  cruises, discotheques & dancing places, dating services, gymnastics,  a theatre, restaurants, horse races, and car insurance (pp. 380–382).  Also more strict clothing standards for men at a casino, higher minimum  ages for men to enter restaurants, and an apartment that only allowed  women (pp. 382–383).
* **Government administration:** Subsidy for  women’s osteoporosis medicines but not men’s (from pension fund), free  public screening for breast cancer but not prostate cancer, higher  retirement age for men (which has been changed) (pp. 387–389).
* **Legislation:** Men’s complaints were all about the  obligatory military or civil service of six to thirteen months (those  who refuse get six months in prison, p. 390).

**Likely motives:** Two alternative rating methods  (tables 52 and 53) find that either (certain) feminist ideas are the  most common motivators of discrimination against men, or sexism and the  feminine bias are the most common motivators (feminine bias meaning  unintentional gender bias of groups of women, counterpart to masculine  bias of groups of men). Financial motives were also frequent (pp.  401-402).",mhelena9201,t2_69t132h7,0.97,54,2
585,lobwtd,2021-02-20,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,"The feminist organization Women’s Liberation Front and the conservative Concerned Women for America, co authored a piece against the Equality Act.","Joe Biden [tweeted](https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1362793213485023237) yesterday : ""The Equality Act provides long overdue federal civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ Americans, preventing discrimination in our housing, education, public services, and lending systems. I urge Congress to swiftly pass this historic legislation""

But the radical feminists and conservatives are hand in hand against the act.  right wing author [Abigail Shrier](https://twitter.com/AbigailShrier/status/1362874848632918021?s=20) calls the Equality Act “the greatest threat to women’s rights in generations.”  

&#x200B;

> The Equality Act would eliminate women as a protected category in the law, making it impossible to exclude biological males from women's safe spaces - women's shelters, locker rooms, prisons, and women's & girls' sports.  It's the greatest threat to women's rights in generations. 

How is this a bad thing ? why should women and only women be considered protected category in the law ?!?! why only women deserve shelters  ? of course we should eliminate women as a protected category in the law. all people should be protected equally. this act is a threat to female privilege not women's rights.

&#x200B;

>More recently, in a [letter](https://catholicvote.org/feminist-voices-decry-democrat-proposed-equality-act/) to Congress, a coalition of feminist organizations is protesting that the 2021 Equality Act would “\[eliminate\] sex as a protected class” and therefore undermine “targeted remedies for the exclusion or **under-representation of women and girls in education**, and in jobs and professions traditionally held by men.”

What ???? what under-representation of women and girls in education ?? we are not in the 1920 ! in the US of 2021 it's men and boys who are disadvantaged in education. (see picture below) Discrimination against women in jobs and professions traditionally held by men is illegal, but apparently they want preferential treatment.

586,ub5a23,2022-04-24,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,The 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and their application to men's human rights,"##Background

These 30 articles were adopted by the United  Nations General Assembly in 1948 and represent some of the most widely agreed upon human rights standards in the world.

Some history and information can be found here:

https://www.ohchr.org/en/what-are-human-rights

And an overview of the 30 articles can be found here:

https://standup4humanrights.org/en/declaration.html

u/iainmf has started a project to create guidelines for men's human rights that are based on authoritative documents like this one.  You can find information about the project [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/u95mh8/applying_best_practice_to_mens_human_rights_my/) and in the subreddit created for it here: r/BestPractice4MR.

I am going to use this site to go through all 30 articles, point out their relevance to men's human rights, existing shortfalls in society, and then offer condensed policy recommendations.  I am not an expert on any of this and it is definitely not perfect but I think it can give us some ideas to look into. I am also not trying to imply that women do not face issues in any of these areas.  The nature of this exercise is to look at issues affecting men because those issues are often ignored by society.

##The 30 articles and their application to men's human rights

###Article 1: Free and equal

*All human beings are born free and equal and should be treated the same way.*

* Men and women are commonly not treated the same by society, institutions, or under the law

This is a very broad article and covers many of the later categories where I will get more specific.  One example that stands out is the Hayden rider modification to the US Equal Rights Amendment which sought to preserve discrimination and unfair treatment against men but not women.  Presumably the Hayden rider modification would cause the bill to be in violation of this article because it would establish unequal treatment between men and women.  This is true regardless if you think discrimination and unfair treatment against men exists, rendering that argument (which is usually made from a place of ignorance) invalid according to basic human rights standards.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. Policies should be mindful of unequal treatment and double standards between men and women
2. Policies should not exclude one gender
3. Policies should justify disproportionate focuses on one gender over the other, and follow relevant data and research instead of personal convictions
4. Policies should not treat men differently from women

###Article 2: Freedom from discrimination

*Everyone can claim their rights regardless of sex, race, language, religion, social standing, etc.*

* Men are commonly discriminated against by sex, marital status, and parental status

* There are many articles in this document where active effort to protect women already exist but men are still denied equivalent rights because of their gender

This is another broad category that covers many of the later categories, so I will be expanding on those topics under those articles.  A couple examples include education, freedom of movement, freedom from forced labor, and bodily autonomy.  

Another thing that comes to mind are discriminatory definitions and implementations of laws concerning sexual assault and domestic violence.  The UK's Sexual Offences Act of 2003 and the US's 1994 Violence Against Women Act are likely in violation of this article.

In the later case, the bill was eventually amended due to constitutional challenges on the grounds of gender equality, but in practice it is still often exclusionary.  One factor that needs to be looked at is the name of the bill itself, since that can influence the implementation of the bill by implying that it is still only about women.  Since this and other articles stress *implementation* as much as *definition* I think the name of the bill is in violation of this and several other articles.

Another issue that needs talked about more is discrimination against single men, which I think is protected by this article because your marital status represents a type of social standing.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. Policies should protect the rights of everyone, including men, regardless of parental or marital status
2. Policies should not exclude men on the basis of their gender
3. Policies should be implemented fairly and equally
4. Checks should be built in to make sure that this is carried out in practice and not just in definition

###Article 3: Right to life

*Everyone has the right to life and to live in freedom and safety.*

* Men are the biggest victims of violence in society and have a much higher mortality rate

* The state often perpetuates this problem or is actively part of the problem

The death penalty is pushed onto male criminals more than female criminals, and in some places the death penalty can legally only be applied to men, and not women.

Forced military conscription seems like it violates this article as well.

It is also frequently the case that violence affecting women is taken more seriously than violence against men. Violence against men is often considered normal or may even be invisible to most people.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. Policies should seek to protect the safety of all people, regardless of gender
2. The life and safety of men should not come second to women, especially when men are victimized at considerably higher rates than women, often because of their gender

###Article 4: Freedom from slavery

*No one has the right to treat you as a slave nor should you enslave anyone.*

* A majority of forced labor around the world, including forced child labor, exploits men and boys
* Men are often victims of coerced labor as well, for example inside of their families
* Husbands and fathers are forced by law to labor for the benefit of women and children against their will

This one intersects with known men's rights issues on several fronts.  The prison industrial complex systematically exploits male labor, and many laws and policies in this area target the criminalization and arrest of men to perpetuate this system.

Men are also treated like indentured servants by child support and alimony policies where they are forced to labor for the benefit of women and children against their will.  The use and exploitation of male labor to support women and children takes on many forms and people are often blind to this.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. Policies should investigate and put an end to forced labor, including forced labor inside the prison industrial complex, and peonage in the form of child support, alimony, marriage laws, and divorce laws

###Article 5: Freedom from torture

*No one has the right to torture you.*

* The treatment of men in prison has been argued to be cruel and unusual
* Enhanced interrogation tactics are still used by militaries around the world, and men are disproportionally the victims of this

One note here is the difference between male prisons and female prisons.  If a given treatment is considered too inhumane for female inmates, then it should also be considered inhumane for male inmates.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. A person's gender should not influence our willingness to engage in torture
2. A person's gender should not change what we consider to be torture.  If it is something we wouldn't inflict upon a woman, then we should not inflict it upon a man.

###Article 6: Right to recognition before the law

*You should be legally protected in the same way everywhere like anyone else.*

* Men are commonly excluded from legal definitions of sexual assault
* Men are commonly excluded from protections and funding offered for victims of domestic violence
* Male bodily autonomy is recognized almost nowhere on the planet

There's probably a lot more but all of this should be covered by this article.  We need to legally recognize male victims of sexual assault and we need to protect infant boys from nonconsensual genital modifications.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. Adopt gender neutral legislation in name, content, and enforcement
2. Extend to men existing protections and rights that are already afford to women

###Article 7: Right to equality before the law

*The law is the same for everyone and should be applied in the same manner to all.*

* Men are profiled by the police and are more likely to be found guilty given the same evidence
* Men receive harsher punishment for the same crimes and mitigating factors
* When the victim of a crime is a man, the police do not investigate the crime as thoroughly, and the perpetrator is punished less severely
* Legislation may be formally written in a gender neutral manner but still end up being enforced unequally

There is again quite a bit you could put here.  While legislation is sometimes gendered, what is more common is that legislation is gender neutral on paper but is still enforced unequally.  This ranges from things like clubs being allowed to charge different cover amounts depending on your gender to the police not believing or caring about male victims of sexual and domestic abuse.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. Legislation should be gender neutral and apply to everyone equally
2. Special care should be taken so that gender neutral legislation is enforced in a gender neutral manner

###Article 8: Access to justice

*You have the right to obtain legal help and access the justice system when your rights are not respected.*

* Men who are going through a divorce or child custody battle usually cannot finance their cases and therefore do not have equal access to justice
* Men who are victims of false allegations find it difficult to clear their names and pursue compensatory damages

This category is something that we fall short of in many ways for everybody.  But men probably run into this a lot more than women, since the legal system is usually set up for women on issues that are commonly gendered.  For example, emergency court ordered alimony and child support payments based on existing prejudices and gendered legislation makes it difficult to seek counsel and fight for a fair and equal outcome to the trial.

Men also find themselves the victims of legal aggression for which they do not have the means to adequately defend themselves.  And in cases of libel, men are usually unable to get the state to intervene on their behalf.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. Courts should not make temporary orders that interfere with a person's ability to obtain adequate legal counsel
2. The state should pay for legal counsel in civil and family cases like it does for criminal cases

###Article 9: Freedom from arbitrary detention

*No one can arrest or detain you arbitrarily, or send you away from your country unjustly.*

* Many militaries do not operate under this principle

Since the military is made up predominantly by men, internal military detention affects more men than women.  And since women and children receive better protection from military aggression, victims of detainment related to military conflicts are also more likely to be men.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. Militaries should not be granted exceptions to this article

###Article 10: Right to a fair trial

*Trials should be public and tried in a fair manner by an impartial and independent tribunal.*

* Men are more likely to be found guilty given the same evidence and mitigating factors against them
* In cases of hearsay, female testimony is more likely to be believed than male testimony

This indicates that juries are not impartial, likely because of systemic gender biases against men.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1.  Judges and juries should be educated about unconscious gender biases against men and be reminded to remain impartial
2. Courts should formally adopt procedures to strike out testimony and evidence that relies on known gender biases

###Article 11: Presumption of innocence

*You are considered innocent until it can be proved you are guilty according to law. If accused of a crime you have the right to a defence.*

* Men are presumed guilty more often than women
* A presumption of innocence does not exist in the court of public opinion
* A presumption of innocence does not exist inside family law

In cases of crimes perceived to be gendered, men are usually treated as guilty before the trial, and this treatment often continues even if they are later found to be innocent.

Family court often takes a guilty until proven innocent approach, especially towards men.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. The media should be held to higher standards when reporting on crimes
2. A good model to follow might be what we do with minors, like leaving out the names of accused parties until after a trial
3. A family court judge should not consider a criminal allegation to have relevance in a trial until those allegations have been proven beyond a reason of doubt in a criminal court
4. Special care should be taken to identify legal and administrative aggression which is disproportionately utilized by women against men

###Article 12: Right to privacy

*You have the right to protection if someone tried to harm your good name, enter your home without permission or interfere with your correspondence.*

* Men are more likely than women to be the victims of privacy encroachment by significant others and digital stalkers
* Due to the weight of a woman's word against a man's, men are often the victims of attacks upon their honor and reputation by women

Basically everything that this article covers is commonly gendered against men, especially in the context of intimate relationships.  Men are more likely to have correspondences spied on than the reverse and men are more likely to have their correspondences actively manipulated than the reverse.  This comes in many forms and includes things like spying on text messages, cyber stalking, and having your social media monitored or even directly controlled by your significant other.

I'm kind of surprised to see that harming someone's reputation falls under this category, but it does make sense when you think of it terms of things you do in private becoming public.

I assume that this has less to do about false allegations and instead has more to do with an ex-lover spilling secrets that you either told them in confidence, or that they gained on their own during the course of your relationship.

One thing that stood out to me was just how commonly this principle is violated in informal day to day social interactions, and over social media.  It is so common that I had no idea this was considered a formal human rights issue.  I instead always thought that the right to privacy was something that was meant to protect you from the government, or maybe from a nosy neighbor.

I am also unaware of any formal legal avenue to address violations concerning attacks on your name.  In cases of libel, what was said about you has to be false.  But in this case the defaming information can actually be true, it just has to have been information that was private.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. Victims of privacy encroachment should have accessable legal avenues to pursue compensation and hold perpetrators criminally liable for their actions
2. We should educate the public about what it means to encroach on someone's privacy, especially given recent advances in information technology, and the rise of social media

###Article 13: Freedom of movement

*You have the right to leave or move within your own country and you should be able to return.*

* One strategy the state uses to force men into non-consensual labor is restriction of movement
* Driver's licenses and passports are commonly revoked for debtors and peons

It's also common for people convicted of crimes to have their passports revoked in some countries, including after their sentence has been fulfilled, which to me seems like is in violation of this article as well.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. Efforts should be made to facilitate the escape from peonage by crossing legal districts where peonage is being enforced on someone

###Article 14: Right to asylum

*If you are persecuted at home, you have the right to seek protection in another country.*

* Men are more likely to be the victims of political persecution than women

I don't see this is as being gendered except to the extent that men are more likely to seek political change and be targeted by existing power structures for speaking out against them.

It also seems to me that our definition of political persecution has been eroded over time, and that certain countries have gained near global access to be able to extradite nearly anyone they want for political purposes.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. We should look into how extradition treaties are written and enforced

###Article 15: Right to nationality

*You have the right to belong to a country and have a nationality.*

* There is a very well known immigration bias that favors women and children over men
* This is especially egregious given the fact that men are more likely to be persecuted in their home county and are more likely to be victims of violence because of their gender

A key part of this article is that you cannot be denied the right to change your nationality.  And we commonly see that men have greater trouble with this than women do.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. A person's gender should not affect their ability to travel or gain nationality in another country

###Article 16: Right to marriage and to found a family

*Men and women have the right to marry when they are legally able without limits due to race, nationality or religion. Families should be protected by the Government and the justice system.*

* Men and boys are commonly not recognized as victims of forced marriages due to gender biases that see men as the more culpable party in a marriage
* Boys are commonly not recognized as victims of child marriages due to similar gender biases
* The family unit is increasingly coming under attack in Western nations by neoliberal policies

This is an article that looks like has been ""solved"" in the modern world until you start looking at some of the details in the definition for it.

I'm not one to raise flags over the ""destruction of the traditional family"" but I think it's interesting that this article specifically protects the family unit and even calls it the basis for society.  It also calls on states to protect the institution of marriage.  So I've included this bullet point for the sake of completeness and possible discussion.

Another note is that we've raised flags over forced marriages and child marriages for women and girls but not for men and boys.  The perception is that men are forcing women into marriages but it is very often the case that both parties are forced into a marriage against their will, not just the female partner.  

Traditional Western martial ages that are being enforced through cultural hegemony onto non-Western nations also impact our perception on this issue.  For example a marriage between an 18 year old male and a 17 year old female will be contextualized as a child marriages for the female partner but not for the male partner.

Note also that in many of these countries it is common and legal for younger people to enter into marriages due to lower life expectancies, and this practice seems to be explicitly protected by the wording of this article because it mentions ""legal"" and ""of age"". This gets defined by the state in which you are married, and the state is then given an obligation to protect these marriages.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. We need better research into forced marriages and child marriages that both respect local customs and laws and that are inclusive of male victims as well

###Article 17: Right to own property

*You have the right to own things. No one has the right to illegally take them from you.*

* Men commonly lose their property through marriage and divorce

This is another article that on the surface looks like shouldn't be a problem, but the full definition does have obvious relevance to gendered issues that men face in society.

In particular there is a very active and state enforced transfer of property from men to women.  This primarily happens during a divorce but you can find examples of it elsewhere as well.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. Men should not be denied a right to their property in the course of a divorce proceeding
2. Special care should be taken to look into the various strategies that are used to transfer property from men to women, including coercion, manipulation, assisted suicide, proxy violence, and spousal homicide

###Article 18: Freedom of religion or belief

*Everyone has the right to freely manifest their religion, to change it and to practice it alone or with others.*

* A man's religious inclinations are seen as more dangerous than a woman's religious inclinations due to racial, religious, and gendered stereotypes in society
* Prejudices against religious men might interfere with their right to movement and their right to nationality

Just making a note that religious prejudices intersect with gendered prejudices against men.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. Religious beliefs should not be seen as problematic when they are practiced by a man

###Article 19: Freedom of Expression

*Everyone has the right to think and say what they like and no one should forbid it.*

* Men are expected to be quiet and listen to women, especially in domestic spheres, and on topics of gender
* This is often enforced institutionally, through the media, and through social media

While this is not a recent problem, we have seen this manifest more and more often in modern times through social media.  Moral panics over the empowerment of women in society have facilitated buzzword like mansplaining to silence men and shut down conversations. This is especially true around the topic of gender which is just as important of an issue for men as it is for women.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. We should reiterate that gender issues affect men just as much as they do women
2. We should reiterate that men are allowed to have opinions about gender issues that affect them
3. We should reiterate that opinions and views held by men are equally as valid and as important as opinions and views held by women

###Article 20: Freedom of assembly

*You have the right to organize and participate in peaceful meetings.*

* Men are seen as bigger threats than women so peaceful assemblies involving men are more likely to be shut down
* Assemblies advocating for men's human rights are met with opposition and are not adequately protected by the state

This bias is so apparent that movements have organized women's only (and sometimes children's only) marches in order to gain sympathy from the public and prevent the police from using excessive force against peaceful demonstrators.

Such a strategy would not have proven useful if this gender stereotype was not an active issue in society.

We have also seen this in the past with conferences for men's issues and even for suicide awareness seminars where the police do a poor job containing crowds, which prevents men from speaking out against issues of sexism and discrimination that affects them.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. The gender makeup of an assembly of people should not influence whether that assembly is seen as peaceful
2. The gender makeup of an assembly should not influence the amount of protection it receives from the state
3. Assemblies for men's human rights should receive the same amount of protection as any other assembly

###Article 21: Right to partake in public affairs

*Everyone has the right to take part in their country’s political affairs and equal access to public service. Governments should be voted for regularly.*

* Public services are often designed for women and exclude men
* The women's lobbying industry seeks to exclude men and men's human rights issues from public discourse and government decision making processes
* There are very few government arms anywhere in the world (including at the U.N.) dedicated to the health and wellbeing of men

A great example of this is the public research funding bias that focuses on women's health, as well as medical services that are not offered to men, despite men being in poorer health and not living as long as women.  Another example are victims services which in many cases simply do not exist at all for men.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. We should not forget about men when proposing and implementing publicly funded services
2. We need to establish government offices that focus on male issues and concerns

###Article 22: Right to social security

*Society should help individuals to freely develop and make the most of all advantages offered in their country.*

* As noted in several previous sections, men are often excluded from public services and benefits
* Gender stereotypes against men prevent them from participating in many important areas of society, including domestic life, education, childcare, and public discourse

Men are often limited to their role in constructing and maintaining society, but are not included in the benefits that this construction and maintenance affords to others.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. Efforts should be made to better include men in publicly offered benefits and services
2. Efforts should be made to include men in all aspects of society instead of limiting them to predetermined roles consisting of labor, construction, and maintaince

###Article 23: Right to work

*Everyone has the right to work in just and favourable conditions and be free to choose your work with a salary that allows you to live and support family. Everyone should receive equal pay for equal work.*

* Men work in less favorable conditions than women and make up well over 90% of occupational deaths and occupational related injuries and health conditions
* Men work longer hours than women in order to support themselves and their families

This one has obvious relevance to existing men's rights discussions around working conditions and work-life balance.

The second bullet point intersects with the active transfer of property from men to women that was discussed in previous sections.

Even if we ignore the human rights questions around alimony and child support, this article would still be relevant because a man should be able to earn enough money to pay for those obligations to support his ""family"" and also support himself.  Many men who are forced to transfer property to women live in abject poverty despite earning decent incomes on paper (a problem that creates biases in statistics and research about poverty).

Many separated fathers want to *voluntarily* provide support for their children, and be involved to a greater degree than society currently allows.  But the economy often prevents them from being able to contribute financially.  What makes this worse is that many child support and alimony laws were created decades ago when the economy allowed for a single parent to support an entire family, which means that child support obligations at the time did not create as large of a burden for separated fathers as they do today.

Anther note is that the ability for a single parent to be able to provide for an entire family seems to be a human rights issue on it's own according to this article.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. We need to improve working conditions, pay, and work-life balance

###Article 24: Right to leisure and rest

*Each work day should not be too long and everyone has the right to rest and take regular paid holidays.*

* Men spend less time outside of work than women do
* Men spend less time relaxing, less time taking naps, and less time sleeping than women do
* Men have less time for leisure and rest even when you include domestic work and childcare

Much like Article 23, this implies that we need to pay people better so that we can spend less time working.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. We need to work on reducing the amount of time men spend laboring to support themselves and their families

###Article 25: Right to adequate standard of living

*You have the right to have what you need so that you and your family do not go hungry, homeless or fall ill.*

* Men are significantly more likely than women to be homeless, hungry, and destitute
* Men receive less funding and care for their health than women do at basically every level of society
* The amount of labor men perform for other people often prevents them from taking care of themselves and receiving preventative medical treatment
* Men die younger than women and are in worse health in almost every nation on the planet

This is another article that has obvious relevance for many traditional men's rights issues.

The pressures to work longer hours at jobs that provide less time off makes it difficult for men to take care of their health and receive preventative medical care.  Governments also spend much more money on women's health than men's health, despite men being in poorer health and dying younger than women.

Men are also more likely to be homeless and destitute.

One interesting thing I saw in this article is a statement granting special status for women and children:

>Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance.

I have not looked at the original declaration or studied the theory behind it, but I imagine this is because pregnant and nursing mothers do actually need special care and assistance for biological reasons, as do children.

The only place where a note like this was included was in this article, so the context is specific to this article.  It does not establish that women and children are more important than men or that their human rights supercede a man's human rights. I think at most this implies a need for general welfare specific to women and children that do not otherwise apply to men, and is not meant to affirm traditional gender roles from men towards women such as providership or protection.  Since those gender roles frequently get abused to infringe on the human rights of men, we need to work on dismantling them instead of making excuses for them.

Moreover, if this article is used to justify the enforcement of traditional male gender roles, I believe that Article 29 (discussed later) would impose complementary gender roles and obligations onto women as well.  This mirrors conversations that question the relationship between rights and obligations.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. We need to work on safety nets and make sure that men aren't falling through the cracks
2. We need to work on facilitating better health, wellness, and support for men, women, and children in society

###Article 26: Right to education

*You have the right to go to school, continue your studies as far as you wish and learn regardless of race, religion or country of origin.*

* Men have been falling behind in all levels of education for decades
* Education has been reformed over the years to cater to women and this has been partially responsible for male underachievement
* All levels of the education system have been demonstrated to discriminate against men
* Men receive lower marks for identical work
* Men are more likely to be punished for identical behaviors
* Men have been shown to suffer from a stereotype bias in education
* Men do not receive male specific affirmative action or support for these shortfalls, and many people continue to believe that it is actually women who need extra help

This is another big one that men's activists have been talking about for a really long time.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. We need to investigate male underachievement and enact positive policy reform on these issues
2. We need to *care* about male underachievement and acknowledge that work needs to be done here
3. We need to put an end to systemic and institutionalized discrimination against men in the education system which only make these problems worse

###Article 27: Right to take part in cultural, artistic and scientific life

*You have the right to share the benefits of your community’s culture, arts and sciences.*

* Men are stereotyped as not being creative
* Masculinity and masculine hobbies are stereotyped as boring, uncool, and sometimes as dangerous and harmful
* Men are stereotyped in media representations as ignorant, incapable, selfish, malicious, and villainous

I don't see many issues here despite the list of bullet points.  The main issue is probably that women are the biggest consumers of art (mainly through television and social media) so they get catered to the most.  As noted earlier, men have less time for themselves than women do so they have fewer opportunities to participate in culture and the arts, especially as consumers.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. We should work on better media representations of men
2. We should put an end to sexism directed towards men in popular media and on social media
3. We should work on work-life issues affecting men so that they can better participate in the consumption and utilization of culture and the arts

###Article 28: Right to a free and fair world

*To make sure your rights are respected, there must be an order that can protect them. This order should be global.*

* There are very few efforts to protect men's human rights in society
* This is especially true when men's issues are gendered and not shared closely with women
* Men's human rights are not taken seriously by many people and many organizations
* Many people wrongly believe that men's human rights are already protected

Of note here is that this comes from a human rights proposals created by the U.N. but the U.N. does not have a specific branch to address the concerns of men in this world.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. We need to affirm that men's human rights concerns are valid and do not come second to women's rights
2. We need to establish governing bodies that are tasked with protecting men and addressing men's issues in society

###Article 29: Duty to your community

*You have duties toward the community within which your personality can fully develop. The law should guarantee human rights. It should allow everyone to respect others and to be respected.*

* Men are commonly seen as protectors and providers who help others, but should not receive help in return
* Many men do not believe that their roles in society are properly respected and compensated
* According to time use studies, men spend more time and labor contributing towards society, and their families, than women do
* Modern culture and gender discussions encourage women to take from society, but to not contributing back in kind. Instead of being seen as selfish, this is instead seen as an empowering and worthwhile goal to strive for.

This one is interesting because it affirms a duty for individuals to work towards a better society.  This is of course what the traditional male role is, and this is sometimes compensated by female roles as well.  But we have gotten rid of many of these obligations for women while keeping them for men.  So in some ways this article could be seen as affirming that women need to step up and either take on traditional masculine roles in society or take on complimentary feminine roles.

I do not believe that gender roles are a good thing, but I do think this point needs developed to be fair to this article.

Of course we could also say that men need to step up in traditional female roles as well, but this is in fact what we already see happening in society, and is something that we are actively improving.  What we haven't seen are complementary changes to hold women equally responsible for the maintenance and progress of society that men have historically been responsible for.  I do not think it is fair to encourage men to take on a larger role in society while women are only expected to do their part *if they want to*.

It is also the case that men currently spend more total time and labor contributing towards society than women do, and this is still true when you include childcare and housework.  A possible implication of this article is that women need to do more so that men can have more time, energy, and resources to engage in rest, leisure, preventative medical care, and the consumption of culture and the arts.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. We need to make sure that society is properly supported by everyone
2. We need to make sure that everyone is doing their part so that human rights can be universal to everyone and not restricted to specific groups of people or genders
3. We need to make sure that we are not sacrificing or ignoring men's human rights because it is convenient to do so

###Article 30: Rights are inalienable

*No one, institution nor individual, should act in any way to destroy the rights enshrined in the UDHR.*

* We have numerous examples of this happening already, and I'm sure the list could be expanded upon

I'm not going to emphasize this point very hard because I think it's important to look for solutions instead of complaining.  I was however surprised by just how many of these articles were relevant to men, and how often they are overlooked when they have implications for men and men's rights.  Men are human beings with thoughts and feelings.  Men can suffer, and love, and have feelings, and therefore deserve all of the same compassion and care that we give to women in society.  Human rights are supposed to be *inalienable* and do not stop mattering just because they might also apply to men and not just women.

####Proposed policy recommendations

1. We need to remind individuals and institutions that human rights do in fact apply to men because men are human
2. Men's rights are human rights",Oncefa2,t2_15it3r,0.98,52,5
587,f3o05q,2020-02-14,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,The narrative of universal historical female oppression is quite insulting to men,"The whole idea of a patriarchal system where men hold all the power which they use to the detriment of women just doesn't hold ground. It's been discussed ad nauseum how the men with the most power are isolated examples and not representative of most men, and that they do not tend to use their power to the benefit of men as a whole. It's also been pointed out that women have tremendous social power. And of course, it's been established that gender roles help and hurt both sexes in significant ways, and that they emerged for reasons totally unrelated to oppressing anyone. On logical grounds, the epidemic of female oppression never really held water.

But in my opinion it's just as abhorrent on a moral level. When you look at how much painful labor men have historically been forced to do, all so their wives and children wouldn't starve, I can't even fathom how you can take away that they must have had so much privilege just because they weren't stuck in the kitchen. Men have throughout all of time been expected to sacrifice so much just so others can live easy lives. Ironically enough this was especially true in pre-industrial, so-called ""patriarchal"" times. It's insulting to look at all the men dying in battlefields and coal mines so that their families can live and say that these men were fiendishly oppressing women all while pursuing their passions.",thereslcjg2000,t2_1t7vpmh1,0.95,65,36

594,o3jjht,2021-06-19,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Leftist Loyalty to Feminism: Misguided and One Sided," Feminism as of today, seems to be nearly synonymous with the Left. If you identify as a leftist then you must support feminism. Perhaps such correlations are not entirely without merit as from the very inception of progressive social and political movements special attention has been reserved for the female sex. The aim of this text however is to examine if feminism as a movement really has played a consistent role in furthering the Leftist cause and if it really does warrant unconditional support from those who identify with the left and also care about issues regarding the sexes.

&#x200B;

>”the first class oppression coincides with that of the female sex by the male.”

\-Friederich Engels \[1\]

&#x200B;

We can see that unique consideration was provided to women and their specific socio-economic conditions within the Left very early on. However no such exception was reserved for men. Even though throughout human history men have faced the greater material adversity. Male issues if they were considered were conceptualized as general issues but female ones as specific. But Leftist solutions for resolving socio-political differences between the sexes has always been through addressing external factors, rather than seeing the problem as being innate to men themselves.

&#x200B;

>“The emancipation of woman will only be possible when woman can take part in production on a large, social scale, and domestic work no longer claims anything but an insignificant amount of her time.”

\-Friederich Engels \[2\]

&#x200B;

>“In order to build a great socialist society, it is of the utmost importance to arouse the broad masses of women to join in productive activity. Men and women must receive equal pay for equal work in production. Genuine equality between the sexes can only be realized in the process of the socialist transformation of society as a whole.”

\-Mao Tse-Tung \[3\]

&#x200B;

Despite the female centered wording this was perhaps the first touch point between leftist thought and men’s issues. Liberation of the sexes was inextricably tied together. Emancipation for one sex also entailed the inevitable emancipation of the other. The integration of women into the working masses is in no way contradictory to the welfare of men but quite the opposite. Historically it has always been men who were confined to the drudgery of the most undignified and harsh forms of labor.

&#x200B;

>“In fact, all pre-monetary economies used forced male labor to carry out large-scale public works. Even in Western Europe, corvées, which Adam Smith called “one of the principal forms of Tyranny,”\[292\] persisted until the end of the 18th century. In Eastern Europe, where men were made to work for free on two, three, even four days of the week, it lasted into the 1860s.\[293\] To the extent that women participated, they worked shorter hours and performed lighter tasks.”

\-Martin Van Crevald \[4\]

&#x200B;

The aim to integrate women in the work force and share the burdens of production on equal basis with men as was the dominant line of thought in Leftism would be the lifting of a great burden from the backs of men as a collective. This is precisely what much of feminism seemingly promises however what we see manifest in political feminism is not necessarily a dedication to radically restructuring society through the equalization in the division of labor between the sexes, but rather a parasitic, amorphous and extremely adaptable social movement led largely by upper class women for largely upper class female interests.

&#x200B;

This conclusion that feminism has largely been an upper class project can be reached from observing the main demands of the “First Wave” Feminists. Chief among which was the right to vote. A right which was reserved only for the land owning class and was granted to landless men; only on the precondition of military service. A precondition very few feminists were willing to accept for themselves and it is without doubt that opinions on this have hardly changed to this very day.

&#x200B;

The other demands such as higher education and property rights seem equally indicative of the class interests of political feminism. Let us keep in mind that higher education would not occupy the minds of a significant number of men as a priority in life up until the second half of the 20th century after World War 2 \[5\]. Similarly, the conditions of the working class prior to end of world war 2, especially that of the male section, should also speak towards the relevance of demanding property rights when the vast majority of people were landless and living from hand to mouth in inhumane working conditions.

&#x200B;

The idea of the near infinite adaptability of Feminism can be further reinforced from observing specific historical examples. Contrary to common belief, Feminism has never had a permanent alliance with the Left. When representing the class interests of its purveyors Feminism has had little difficulty in functioning outside of leftist/liberal society. Perhaps the most extreme example of the rapidly shifting colors of feminism would be the feminist success story within Nazi Germany. Following the election of the Nazi Party in large parts thanks to women who accounted for 45% of the votes which also dispels myths about women being natural Leftists. \[6\]

&#x200B;

>”Following the Nazis’ rise to power, women’s organizations saw their numbers swell. In 1933 alone, 800,000 new members joined the Nationalsozialistische Frauenschaft (NSF). Membership in the women’s league eventually reached 3.5 million.”

\-Martin Van Crevald. \[7\]

&#x200B;

Work was a burden, for which the Nazis utilized its captured slaves, prisoners of war and even its own German men who they considered superior to all others. On the other hand, promises of permanent leisure were made to German women by the Nazi government.

&#x200B;

>“The idea that women should be sheltered from the seamier side of law and politics led to the dismissal of female politicians, senior civil servants and judges, as well as the professional disqualification of some 300 female lawyers. These measures were supported both by the head of the Nazi Women’s Association — who rejoiced in Hitler’s promise to liberate women from work\[89\] — and by the grande dame of German feminism, Gertrude Bäumer.\[90\] In any case, they only affected about 1 percent of all working women. And most of those who lost their jobs, including female school principals, were transferred to other positions. The rest received full pensions.”

\-Martin Van Crevald. \[8\]

&#x200B;

A less extreme example would be the suffragette movement in Britain which has been mythologized as the struggle of a group of principled and dedicated young female ‘Davids’ against the patriarchal ‘Goliath’ that was the then British government, demanding their right to express their political opinion through the vote. However nothing could be further from the truth. At the height of the movement the suffragettes were more well funded than the Labour Party. \[9\] Not to mention when it came to men, committing acts of vandalism or arson punishment usually resulted in flogging or hard labor, the law it seems was not blind when it came to women committing what amounted to acts of terror on the streets of London with the aim of realizing their political aspirations.

&#x200B;

>“It may be well to recall the outrageous facts of modern female immunity and free defiance of the law as illustrated by one quotation of a description of the merry time of the window-smashers of March 1912 in Holloway prison given by a correspondent of The Daily Telegraph. The correspondent of that journal describes his visit to the aforesaid prison, where he said there appeared to have been no punishment of any kind for any sort of misbehaviour.“All over the place,” he writes, “is noise – women calling to women everywhere, and the officials seem powerless to preserve even the semblance of discipline. A suffragist will call out her name while in a cell, and another one who knows her will answer, giving her name in return, and a conversation will then be carried on between the two. This chattering obtains all day and far into the night. The ‘officials’ as the wardresses prefer themselves called, have already given the prison the name of ‘the monkey-house.’ Certain it is that the prisoners are treated with all deference, the reason being perhaps that the number of officials is insufficient to establish proper order. While I was waiting yesterday one lady drove up in a carriage and pair, in which were two policemen and several bundles of clothes, to enter upon her sentence and this is the note which seems to dominate the whole of the prison. Seventy-six of the prisoners are supposed to be serving sentences with hard labour, but none of them are wearing prison clothes, and in only one or two instances have any tasks of any description been given, those generally being a little sewing or knitting.”Again a member of the Women’s Freedom League at a meeting on 19th May 1912 boasted that the suffragettes had a wing of their own at Holloway.“They had nice hot water pipes and all the latest improvements and were able to climb up to the window and exchange sentiments with their friends.”

\-E. Belfort Bax. \[10\]

&#x200B;

In a show of complete lack of principles we see the suffragettes become the most dedicated cheerleaders of the first world war and the military draft as well through the infamous “white feather campaign” when it became convenient for them.

&#x200B;

>“The complete bankruptcy of the suffragette movement was demonstrated with the outbreak of the First World War. The WSPU ended all protests and became the most firm supporter of the British government and the war effort. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George personally solicited the aid of the WSPU and financed pro-war demonstrations organized by them with the slogan “We demand the right to serve.” Emmeline even used a feminist argument to justify this, claiming that Germany was a “masculine nation.”After the war, Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst adopted reactionary anti-union positions and were among the first women to run in elections, which they did under the banner of the Conservative Party.”

\-\[11\]

&#x200B;

The betrayal of Leftist principles by the suffragettes had not gone unnoticed or unappreciated by the bourgeois of the time even those who were opposed to their demands.

>“I hope that the day will never come when the chivalry of the men of this country will have descended to such a low position. We look upon women not as our equals but as our guardian angels, as above us in all that is pure, and noble, and holy, and anything that is for the amelioration of women I shall vote for. I have recorded my appreciation of the manner in which women behaved themselves during the last election. They steadied public life in this country, and stemmed the tide of Socialism, Bolshevism and unrest. They have done much to strengthen this country politically. I have no objection to the further enrolling of womenfolk, but we must take time with these things. We must use the brains which the Almighty gave us for the benefit of the country at large and not waste time in this House talking about things that cannot materialise. So, while I vote for everything that will make for the political amelioration of women, I regret that I cannot vote for this Bill.”

\-Mr William Coote. \[12\]

&#x200B;

These examples go to prove one thing beyond doubt. Feminism can be politically adaptable, morally corruptible and principally bankrupt. There is no inseparable connection between feminism and Leftism or any particular political ideology. It is apolitical and amorphous.

&#x200B;

And we see this criticism being echoed by principled persons on the Left.

&#x200B;

>“The feminists see men as the main enemy, for men have unjustly seized all rights and privileges for themselves, leaving women only chains and duties. For them a victory is won when a prerogative previously enjoyed exclusively by the male sex is conceded to the “fair sex”. Proletarian women have a different attitude. They do not see men as the enemy and the oppressor; on the contrary, they think of men as their comrades, who share with them the drudgery of the daily round and fight with them for a better future. The woman and her male comrade are enslaved by the same social conditions; the same hated chains of capitalism oppress their will and deprive them of the joys and charms of life.”

\-Alexandra Kollontai. \[13\]

&#x200B;

>“If it were a matter of bourgeois ladies voting, the capitalist state could expect nothing but effective support for the reaction. Most of those bourgeois women who act like lionesses in the struggle against “male prerogatives” would trot like docile lambs in the camp of conservative and clerical reaction if they had suffrage. Indeed, they would certainly be a good deal more reactionary than the male part of their class. Aside from the few who have jobs or professions, the women of the bourgeoisie do not take part in social production. They are nothing but co-consumers of the surplus value their men extort from the proletariat. They are parasites of the parasites of the social body. And consumers are usually even more rabid and cruel in defending their “right” to a parasite’s life than the direct agents of class rule and exploitation. The history of all great revolutionary struggles confirms this in a horrible way.”

\-Rosa Luxembourg. \[14\]

&#x200B;

Feminism had largely gone into hiding during the great wars and would not see reemergence into the public sphere until peace and prosperity were the status quo once more. We eventually see this resurrection through what is termed as the “Second Wave” of feminism which is usually marked with the release of the book “The Feminine Mystique” by Betty Friedan in 1963. Betty’s book was more a call on women to stop being lulled into the passivity of the suburban housewife and pursue their own destiny in the form of fulfilling careers rather than a declaration of war against the hegemonic oppression of “male tyranny”. Moving forward however Friedan's “problem which had no name” \[15\] was soon to be given one, “Men”.

&#x200B;

This trend towards essentialiazing female social issues, real or perceived, and pinning it on men instead of any external factors was less a revisionist trend in feminism and more of a return to its original roots. In this instance it was Betty Friedan who was perhaps the deviant instead of the traditional. This can be observed from the very first instances of organized feminism.

&#x200B;

>The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman, having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her.

\-Declaration of Sentiments \[16\]

&#x200B;

The trend continues with Simone De Beauvoir.

&#x200B;

>“Everything he wins, he wins against her; the more powerful he becomes, the more she declines. In particular, when he acquires ownership of land, he also claims woman as property.”

\- Simone De Beauvoir. \[17\]

&#x200B;

And perhaps reaches its naked crescendo in Feminist Radicalism of the 70s.

&#x200B;

>‘‘Women are an oppressed class....We identify the agents of our oppression as men. Male supremacy is the oldest, most basic form of domination. All other forms of exploitation and oppression (racism, capitalism, imperialism, etc.) are extensions of male supremacy: men dominate women, a few men dominate the rest. All power structures throughout history have been male-dominated and male-oriented. Men have controlled all political, economic and cultural institutions and backed up this control with physical force. They have used their power to keep women in an inferior position. All men receive economic, sexual, and psychological benefits from male supremacy. All men have oppressed women....We will not ask what is ‘revolutionary’ or ‘reformist,’ only what is good for women.’’

\-‘Redstockings Manifesto. \[18\]

&#x200B;

While the “second wave” of feminism which arose from the civil rights movement and the “New Left” definitely had some semblance of commitment to the demands of economic justice of the “old left”, the politically promiscuous nature of feminism soon asserted itself as even the lip service to economic justice was dropped once it was realized that it was a sinking ship. What took place instead was a practice in political and economic opportunism of developing niches for upwards social mobility of a small section of women. These niches included such avenues as academia, professional activism, various women’s NGOs, etc. One of the first ’women and gender studies’ programs was established in 1973 by Sally Miller Gearheart who had emphasized the need for a eugenics program to decrease the male population to 10%. \[19\]

&#x200B;

Evaluating the historical picture painted thus far two things become apparent, that of feminism as a movement being politically and ideologically opportunistic. While it might align itself with Leftist or Liberal Politics today and adopt the rhetoric of equality, history shows that such alliances are for purely pragmatic reasons. For all the aesthetics of leftism which feminism appropriates, when it comes to actually forwarding the principles of equality between the sexes, its historical record and current status stands in complete contradiction. Those at the helm of feminism defining its trajectory have made their aims apparent. They wish to remain a parasite upon the parasitic classes, developing niches for themselves to monopolize and excel within.

&#x200B;

The principled egalitarianism of the old left was always unpalatable to the bourgeois women at the core of feminist movements. Arousing the “broad masses of women to join in productive activity” in order to equalize the sexual division of labor would leave them no better than the rest which is unacceptable for a movement whose only long term aim is to perpetuate itself within niches it has created to further consolidate and expand its parasitic relations within the existing power structures in order to extract benefits and privileges. Leftism will have to answer a crucial question in the coming days, is Feminism beholden to Leftism or is it the other way around. Because If our aim is to resolve the social and economic contradictions between the sexes especially those which disproportionately affect men, feminism is the very last thing we should be looking towards especially when it goes against the very principles we expect it to live up to.

595,few8ti,2020-03-07,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,The Aurat Azadi March,"On the 8 of March many cities across my country,Pakistan,will be holding rallies against the plight of women and minorities.If you ask me this is wonderful as the suffering that women,ESPECIALLY poor women face in the country is unacceptable and something we should've dealt with 30 years ago.

However this is not about that.I am making this post(mostly) about demand 14.While 15 is questionable too,it isn't too bad if it doesn't get out of hand and it's an excellent way to help minorities who may not have access to the same resources as the more well off people(Though in Pakistan wealth is divided by class not by gender or race. It's that women just don't inherit their share and this is addressed by the other demands.For Trans folks though this is excellent.). This demand should be based on economic conditions,not gender.

Now on to demand 14. It states:

""Institutional support and affordable credit for women entrepreneurs and cooperative enterprises to support improved livelihoods for women""

Pakistan is a very capitalist country.Not the fun ""Personal choice"" type of capitalism. The ""Modern slavery and Child labour"" type of capitalism. If the government were to seriously interfere like this it could kill many small businesses. Small business is an important economic activity for many Men. It employs and occupies a large part of the Urban population. Men are essentially the sole bread winners and in a country with an economy like Pakistan's they have to work grueling and long hours to be able to support themselves and families. Here in Karachi it's not uncommon for shops to be open until 3 in the night and even longer for some. Many men have multiple jobs to support their livelihood.

This policy would give Women entrepreneurs an edge in a rather cutthroat market. This could either end in 2 ways. It could,without hurting men, aid women and lift them from their economic imprisonment while also creating more jobs which is a plus. Or it could be that women entrepreneurs simply out compete male ones and use their extra resources to make a larger profit at expense of business that weren't aided by the government because of the owner's gender. A better alternative would be to support small businesses in general and encourage women through advertisement and programs which train them to compete. Not out right supporting them over others.

This could push men,especially boys into far worse jobs as they many have to find work elsewhere like the notorious brick industry which is infamous for it's use of child labour,mostly boys. Many manufacturing industries in Pakistan are reliant on young boys who are expected to aid,and in grim scenarios,replace their father in feeding the family.Often these industries are fertile grounds for a vile practice called ""Bachabazi""(drug abuse) which translates to ""Child game"" which without the disgusting coyness is pedophilia. The victims of Bachabazi are almost always boys. What they are paid for all this suffering is pitifully low. I intend to discuss Bachabazi with this subreddit at a later date as it is a complex issue so this is it for now.

In the corporate sphere this could lead to many companies not wanting male CEOs(in the relatively far future) in order to get support from the government. This could rob men of promotion and a key(and shitty) feature of Pakistani corporate culture is that often if you leave the company to join another you **have to start from scratch.** In corporate Pakistan positions are often based on seniority so leaving is not exactly ideal(though this could be changing).

There's also the fact that the Pakistan government is rather incompetent(the current one especially) and corrupt. They have too many times taken a very heavy handed approach which fuck things up more then anything. The best thing the government has ever done for the economy was leave the private sector alone under Nawaz Sharif. I am almost convinced the current parliament will botch this and screw everyone over. 

These problems have nothing to do with feminism and are often the fault of Pakistan's economic woes. I doubt the leaders of the March thought about all this while making the charter so I doubt this is out of malicious intent. I'm sure they had nothing but good intentions during the formation of the charter but the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

Another thing is that the march seems to be pushing the Patriarchy narrative which is something this subreddit has discussed to kingdom come and why it's so bad so I won't bore you with it.

So I would like to know what folks here think.Perhaps my concerns are unfounded and I am over reacting and have grown overly suspicious of feminism.Thoughts?",SonnBaz,t2_1qcn6nqj,1.0,9,2

&#x200B;

Now personally I could care less if a man wanted to identify as a minimalist, whether by choice and intention or because his circumstances forced him into

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But I get the impression that a lot of men identify as ''minimalists'' involuntarily due to the fact not only are men held to a higher standard when it comes to consumer culture, men still lack a lot of purchasing power, so while the majority of net tax payers are totally men, is important to remember also we get the least in return for our taxes

&#x200B;

Examples of this double standard in action

&#x200B;

\-If a man indulges in hobbies like video games, plushies, funko pops or Legos, he's seen as a neckbearded manchild who likes to just hoard and is suffering from peter pan syndrome

\-If a man wants to rock his Bugatti or a 1 million dollar watch, he's seen as a greedy bastard who should avoid flexing his stuff in order to avoid appearing as some sort elitist asshole around others

\-Oh and if a man does indulge in traditionally masculine hobbies and pastimes such as woodworking, working on cars, blacksmithing,  playing sports, etc he still is seen as some who is being overly selfish and putting his self interests over others in such a vile manner

\-If a man goes on a little vape, drinks some booze or smokes a cigar here and there he's seen as some irresponsible hedonist who needs to be taken into therapy

My theory for why this could be the case? It might have to do with the fact men back in the day were the ones who were being the breadwinners, so in order to have go on about being one, you had to be as frugal as they come and just ''hold it in'' and not enjoy your life whatsoever, just work work work work until you die and not get to enjoy any of the fruits of your labor

&#x200B;

597,riqf7b,2021-12-17,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Notice how these concepts are mostly (if not only) described as issues that ONLY affect women?,"Two things that come to my mind are compulsory heterosexuality and something that we are all familiar with; emotional labor.

Comphet (which is the abbreviation of compulsory heterosexuality) is described as ""the theory that heterosexuality is assumed and enforced upon women by a patriarchal and heteronormative society."" So basically, this implies that it's an issue that affects women exclusively as if men are not expected to conform to heteronormativity by being with a woman or even having sex with them. But there are people out there who somehow convinced themselves that lesbian relationships are not taken seriously by society while gay male relationships are.

And when it comes to emotional labor, there is something that doesn't sit well with me. How are women expected to perform emotional labor to their partners with nothing in return when men are expected/socially conditioned not to express themselves/not to complain in the first place. I mean the fact that men are repressing their emotions (except anger) for the sake of other people, isn't this a form of emotional labor according to feminists' description?

1. She is unable to acknowledge that EVERYONE who has been outside of work for a while could use help getting back in
2. She is unable to acknowledge that by continuing support for women only, it lessens the ability of men to take on duties because they won't be supported by programs such as these
3. She's sighted a bunch of ""statistics"" without giving any actual statistics let alone sources for them
4. Then goes on to say there's a bunch of initiatives to create jobs which is not gender specific as though that makes up for the discrimination.

600,f56g96,2020-02-17,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Feminists are extremely confused about the role of so-called Patriarchy in the pre-industrial world.,"Before the steam engine was developed, everything in the world was made by hand, or grown. All of our written history comes from civilizations. Now, humans are not naturally evolved to live in a civilization. We evolved to live as hunter-gatherers. 

The hunter-gatherer life is wildly different from life in a pre-industrial civilization. 

The latter has rigid, unchanging laws. The former handles disagreements with a conversation around the campfire.

Civilizations before the age of industry are rigidly stratified by class and sex. Hunter-gatherers have no distinctions of sex between adults, although males tend to do almost all hunting of anything bigger than a cat, but otherwise a woman is an adult just like anyone else.

Civilizations before industrialization are extremely unfree: only a tiny group at the top of society has any freedom. Hunter-gatherers all come and go as they please.

Now there's reasons why this is the case. Civilizations that were less rigid didn't thrive, and instead were overrun by nastier, sterner civilizations. So the environment selected for rigidly run civilizations instead of the gentler forager mode of living which is the instinctive preference of humanity, due to our genetic inheritance.",czerdec,t2_qo1hq,0.95,19,6
601,fk9gla,2020-03-17,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Paul Elam is using this crisis to promote privatisation of healthcare and normalising premium health care rices,"**Please advise me how I could change this title to make it sound less accusatory*

I've made a few posts about my concern about how right wing the MRM is, and how I think this is reasonable given the monopoly feminism has over the liberal/centre-left and some of the actual left, but also systemic to the anti-feminist community, particularly the A Voice For Men network. Meaning that MRM essentially DOES function as a radicalisation towards the right of the axis. 

I have to say that I don't know Paul personally and completely respect his work on feminism and men's well-being. He has definitely been misrepresented by the media and in that regard faced slander and defamation. I am also aware that Dr. Warren Farrell's approach was perhaps TOO agreeable for dealing with what is ultimately a political and corporate feminist lobby no less ruthless and bloodthirsty than the Fortune 500 companies. 

I don't think we're ever going to see eye to eye though, because his fundamental view on rights is negative-based and...rooted in Boomer Protestant work ethic, whereas I am positive-based and liberal progressive. His views on hierarchy essentially are way more conservative than mine; despite all his talk about men rejecting social expectations, he has proven that he essentially dislikes feminism because of its erosion of social hierarchy which is inextricably masculine. He also redefined MGTOW to become patriarchs-on-strike to pacify the conservatives flocking to the movement post-Trump.

In this instance, on his Facebook he's posted at least twice about COVID and his experiences working in both the private and public sector. He said that when a sector was privatised it had the best workers but when it became even slightly public they all fled (capital flight) which he saw as terrible. The work ethic of the people declined, their attitude declined and the system became more bureaucratic. To an extent I sympathise with this because bureaucracy does get in the way of focussing on clients, patients. 

In response somebody posted an image of how much top doctors are paid which was OBSCENE. It was some 20 MILLION dollars a year! 

...and all Paul had to say was that he wants the best of the best leading the market to get paid the best. This isn't even nuanced this is unabashed pro-capitalism pro-hierarchy stance. 

He also repeating the nobody-is-owed-my-labor and has tied it to an entitlement and victimhood ethic among Millennials especially on 'the left'. He has been known to share memes which are just pure Boomerisms alluding that young people need a taste of war to understand how good and easy they have it. (This is particularly odd given how anti-war he used to be!) This division between needing to make it clear to feminists about how hard most men have it **and essentially reifying war and strife as a manifestation of the hardship which every human should go through because It Builds Character** must be exhausting. Obviously he abhors socialism and Communism and is extremely hostile towards government or a large state. **Indeed he pointed to research which he emphatically stated didn't come from government or a public sector into finding a vaccine for H1N1.** While the rest of this could maybe be seen as non-political, this is very obviously capitalising on bashing socialised healthcare during the pandemic crisis. 

It's obvious that any criticism of capitalism is seen as feminist and for all the rhetoric about improving the lives of men the need to promote the market and hierarchies comes first. There will ALWAYS be disposability if there is a need for hierarchy. Indeed I find most MRAs either do not have an answer to the issue of industrialism; they both use The Industrial Age as the archetypal example of man-as-slave while also longing for it because at least then women and children respected them! To me there is very little difference between this almost gratutious anti-Utopianism and the traditionalism which he tries to wake men up to. I think some MRAs want men to have to hard just because women will find that attractive and it'll curb hypergamy-indeed there is a concerning trend of trad-lite women who promote such a view, that either men break their backs and die, or hypergamy finds no use for them, relies on the government and the extended family of 'beta orbiters' for all their needs and men both can't get laid or married but also have their jobs and community role rendered obsolete. **We should not be treating this as women's nature as it lets the Right win.** 

**Paul is entitled to his opinion, this isn't a crime.** But the point is HE LEADS THE MOVEMENT in all but name. Entire communities and networks are effectively reporting back to him. This isn't a secret even as he promotes a need for a corporate organisational structure for the purpose of efficiency. I don't know any INFLUENTIAL lefty MRAs especially not within the AVFM network. Yes Dr Farrell is a wonderful man but Democrats aren't left. In Europe he'd be seen as a compassionate conservative or classical liberal tbh.  We don't exactly have an MRA version of Bernie, for example, the moment that they become that fiscally left they immediately start blaming mostly-men-as-ruling-class for everything. 

What really lets me about all this is I'm not sure whether Paul is authentically way more right wing than his men's-liberation-from-gynocentrism pitch made out half a decade ago, or whether he has been tailoring his pitch increasingly conservative for the sake of his MAGA and Libertarian Party audience. I guess my fear is that just as feminist rhetoric often makes it sound like we're still in the 70s, the MRM tries to sweep all the issues with the past under the rug as necessary or even virtuous. Once again none of this discredits Paul's leadership and advocacy as a counsellor and thought leader.

603,q0qp6f,2021-10-03,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Watch people twist themselves into pretzels to justify female privilege as equality,"I'm not linking to the direct post to prevent brigading, but I just witnessed a very laughable thread. It was a post on CMV, alleging that the norm that men should always have to pay on dates should go away. Those who went to challenge this engaged in some rather remarkable mental gymnastics.

We start with the most common refutation, that the cultural norm isn't that ""men should pay"" but rather ""who asks for dates should be the one who pays"". The OP points out that in practice, men do most of the asking out on dates, women rarely initiate dates, and the end result is still that men pay for everything. This is why this cultural norm should change. The opponent demands proof that women rarely ask men out and receives it, and then engages in this refutation:

> The source you provided says that 83% of men PREFER to do the asking. If it’s their preference, then it would seem that they don’t see asking a woman out as a burden. There shouldn’t be any issues if most men are fine with being the ones that extend the invitation. 

Notice how in any other situation where women tend to be in favor of things that are seen to oppress them, this is chalked up to internalized misogyny. While I think this term is often misused, it does describe real phenomena that when you raise and socialize someone a certain way, you can convince them to agree with cultural norms that aren't in their best interest (like genital mutilation for example).

 In this case, men who don't initiate dates are not only less successful at dating, but oftentimes stereotyped as being socially awkward, ""beta"", socially anxious or less masculine. It is hardly surprising that men would therefore prefer the action that leads to their greater dating success and social acceptance. While there may be some accuracy that men may on average, be more assertive and may be more prone to being the ones to initiate dates, this can hardly be placed solely on biological differences. There are clear social and cultural expectations around dating that enforce the idea that men must initiate dates, must pay for dates and if they don't, they are losers. 

> No one is forcing men to pay for first dates. The problem is that some men are frustrated because they can’t date the women they want with the standards they have, so they choose to complain about it. There are plenty of women who go Dutch, go find them and avoid the ones who won’t. 

Now we have the claim (not supported by data) that in fact, many women will split the bill on a date. It's simply that men have too high of standards and if they just dated the ignored women (nice girls?) then they wouldn't have this problem. While no doubt, some women are okay to split the bill on dates it hardly seems to be a majority. And if anything, women seem to be more choosy on dating apps than the other way around. 

> ...Women carry more inherent risk with sex, so for the most part we’re not serial dating or seeing as many men as possible. It’s not even a desire. Some (like myself) aren’t even interested in dating that much and if I’m choosing to go out with 1 out of 500 men, then I’m going to choose the one that makes the most effort to court me. 

Notably, this person who ""isn't very interested in dating"" is a poster on the hate sub, FDS. While dating apps are filled with disproportionately more men than women, giving women an edge in choosiness, a large part of the point of encouraging women to initiate more is to equal the playing field a little bit. Again, while some biological predispositions may prevent equal parity (maybe), the removal of societally enforced gender norms will no doubt have an impact.

 **Allowing women to initiate dates may likely play a role in decreasing the risks women face while dating**. They can ask out men that they feel safe with. Men will have less reason to keep persisting and pursuing after being told no (on some misguided belief that she's just playing hard to get). There's a lot of ways women's safety would improve if it were normal for women to say what they think instead of playing hard to get and waiting to be pursued. **But FDS often rails about the safety of women while defending the very norms that enable these dangers to thrive.** 

> Of the same amount of time on the date? You are discounting the extra time it takes for her to get ready.

Another common refutation is that women spend their time to look nice for a date and therefore deserve to be compensated. This ignores a few things: 

1. Not every woman is going to spend lots of time and money to get ready. Some women are really into cute clothes and makeup and hairstyling and some aren't into it at all and will spend minimal time and effort.
2. Some men will spend lots of time on their appearance, grooming, shaving, styling, wearing expensive watches, clothes, shoes, etc. And no one argues they need to be compensated for such. 
3. The societal beauty standards enforced on women are largely enforced by the cosmetics industry that invents flaws, creates insecurities and then sells products to minimize them. This is largely not the fault of men and the cosmetics industry making women think they need to spend hundreds of dollars and several hours to look perfect is a wrong that is not righted by making men pay for everything. 
4. This sounds a lot like sex work and objectifies women. It insists that it is the job of the woman to look pretty and the job of the man to pay her for looking pretty next to him. It's a gross mindset that encourages the objectification of women for their looks and men for their wallets. 

All in all, it just irritates me. It is such an obvious and clear enforced double standard and leftover gender role. And yet even people who would never defend women belonging in the kitchen will twist themselves in knots to defend why society should continue to pressure men to pay for everything. It's such an obvious double standard.

For me a couple means a team who does help each other unknowingly to survive and to help their children and families grow according to their strength. But, still in today's equality race it looks like our houses have become industries too. 
Many times we hear that men only do 25% of house chores only (don't know who measures it), they don't do dish washing, don't help in cooking etc. I believe that women must be working very much in houses but I don't approve of shaming men for not helping them because most of the financial and risk involving responsibilities are still done by men only in our house. 

That's why I have written this post to ask all of you some traditional house chores which are still done by men. Some examples like, fixing the roofs, repairing cars, electronic devices or electric issues etc. 

I encourage both men and women to help each other in their daily work but this post is for those who shame men or want to show them as lazy. 

Previously, while reading the book by Dr. Warren Farrell, The myth of male power I saw some mentions about the traditional house chores by men, I tried to search it but I didn't find, if anyone has it then they can share it with me.

608,17dly6x,2023-10-22,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,If you guys want some insight into what it’s like being a boy in the education system right now…,"Search ""boys"" in the r/teachers subreddit. The insane misandrist bile being written by the people who are meant to be educating them is absolutely disgusting. They are discussing boys - children, the most vulnerable and powerless group - who are falling apart and not able to even live normal lives, and they can’t stop themselves from blaming them because they’re male. Boys require more support and care than ever before and all they’re giving them is hate. 

There is systematic bias against boys, with studies showing that female teachers grade boys more severely, undermining their grades and confidence, and punish them more harshly for the same behaviour. Of course, it never occurs to them that their rhetoric contributes to the problem. If you talk about your students with such bias, I promise you are treating them biased. Teaching is a profession dominated by women, and education is geared around women’s expectation of girls. These women mimic the rest of society by not taking seriously the idea that their male students may have their own sets of problems. 

Males at every developmental stage have been unfairly demonized and demoralized, being told they are evil and awful, which they now believe. If girls were falling apart like this, everyone would, and does, rush to protect them. However, when boys do? They are blamed, belittled, and ridiculed by teachers, hell by some of the fucking parents in some threads. If the people in that subreddit are any indication of what the average teacher is like, what they think, and how they treat their male students it’s no fucking wonder boys are underachieving in education. These are the people tasked with educating the next generation of men. Even young boys are not receiving the empathy they need. THE BOYS NEED EXTRA HELP.

The lack of understanding among some women is truly astonishing. For YEARS, the spotlight has been on women and THEIR issues, how challenging THEIR lives can be, and how evil, predatory, and oppressive men are. How one in every three women or whatever bullshit number they make up has been sexually harassed in some way. The amount of women who are so incredibly self-centered and completely blind to everything men do to uplift women is staggering. It’s truly difficult to envision male teachers talking about girls this way while still considering themselves good people.",AlecMaiz0,t2_2ksq45rf,0.96,257,85
609,hcp1h4,2020-06-20,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Overview of Feminist Studies on the responsbility of Feminists for creating the current Police State.,"This is something that is kept out of the public consciousness by constant distractions and yet couldn't be more relevant to current events. 

Everyone contributed to the Police State in the US as it is, and I mean that sincerely. This is about how Feminism kneecapped the leftist movement against prisons by pitting leftists against Men, against Rights, and for Prisons and State Violence by creating profits for the Prison Industry and State Governments.

""Carceral Feminism""  
This term was coined by Elizabeth Bernstein, a pro sex-work intersectional Feminist who wrote a paper on the long and uncriticized trend of Feminists allying with Right-Wing evangelicals to end trafficking.

She argued that:

> ...this article seeks to demonstrate the extent to which evangelical and feminist antitrafficking activism has been fueled by a shared commitment to carceral paradigms of social, and in particular gender, justice (what I here develop as “carceral feminism”) and to militarized humanitarianism as the preeminent mode of engagement by the state.  

And observed many times:

>During the past decade, the term “trafficking” has once again been made synonymous with not only forced but also voluntary prostitution, while an earlier wave of political struggles for both sex workers’ and migrants’ rights has been eclipsed (see, e.g., Kempadoo and Doezema 1998; Chapkis 2005; Agustı´n 2007). According to observers both laudatory and critical, this displacement has been facilitated by the embrace of human rights discourses by abolitionist feminists, who have effectively neutralized domains of political struggle around questions of labor, migration, and sexual freedom via the tropes of prostitution as gender violence and sexual slavery 

&#x200B;

Some takeaways from her essay, available [here](https://glc.yale.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/militarized_humanitarianism_meets_carceral_feminism.pdf).

* In order to make the case, the term trafficking was used to censor the difference between prostitution and slavery.
* Western Feminists descending on foreign nations has served as a militarized humanitarian effort to justify war, neocolonial policy and authority, and a consumer culture of feel good saviors.
* Class is not only the source issue for prostitution, but neoliberal professional women (PMC) also despise it as an antithesis to their class climbing lifestyle.
* The primary effort to stop prostitution was punishing Men, 'charity', and enacting market discipline. It didn't work.
* Bernstein associated Carceral Feminists with the authority they helped to create, however she ultimately imagined that Feminists had been better in the past.

But they hadn't.

In [""Should Domestic Violence Be Decriminalized""](https://harvardjlg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2012/01/jlg-winter-5.pdf) Leigh Goodmark overviews the history of the anti-DV movement.

> In 1984, the United States started down a path towards the criminalization of domestic violence that it has steadfastly continued to follow. The turn to the criminal legal system to address domestic violence coincided with the rise of mass incarceration in the United States. Levels of incarceration have increased by five times during the life of the anti-domestic violence movement.  

Some important takeaways:  
\*Feminists demanded an end to due process and rights, and demanded mandatory arrests for calls. They also created laws that awarded monies to courts for filing restraining orders, maintaining arrest quotas, and forcing victims out of the legal process so that prosecutions could not be dropped.

\*VAWA is one such source of funding, and by originally demanding mandatory arrests virtually guarantees a profit incentive to falsify crimes.

\*There is no reliable data showing that this has worked, or that increased funding has helped any victim. 

\*It affects primarily the poor and people of color (Black Americans have the least share of wealth, followed by Hispanic Americans)

\*It ignores the real causes, backgrounds, and actors in Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). Note: From a Male perspective: Women have been shown in many studies to contribute to half of physical violence, rape, and completely dominate child abuse cases. Feminists have shown nothing but contempt or ignorance for these unbiased studies.

\*As a result of Feminist politicking, Social Work is now coupled to Law Enforcement. The effects of this have created a bubble culture of people who despise victims and demand obedience.

> Aya Gruber recounts her days as a public defender: “I observed government actors systematically ignore women’s desires to stay out of court, express disdain for ambivalent victims, and even infantilize victims to justify mandatory policies while simultaneously prosecuting the victims in other contexts.” 

\*Legitimate victims may be holding back their reports, while sociopaths are enjoying their ability to lock up their ex boyfriend over nothing.

\*Theories of what to do include restricting law enforcement to genuinely dangerous violence or sexual assault, Deterrence based on reducing what police and courts can respond to  - for example exclusively empirical data, and cost/benefit changes to policy measuring how law enforcement and prison makes the situation worse and causes far more harm than a potentially petty squable ever did.

Mimi Kim, author of ""The Carceral Creep: Gender-BasedViolence, Race, and the Expansion of thePunitive State, 1973–1983"" which is not freely available, went even further in showing that the Feminist movement was carceral far before Bernstein had imagined. This includes a criticism of the Duluth Model first trialed in Minnesota where the first riots after George Floyd's killing happened. 

Takeaways: The State has methods of infiltrating civil society and demanding it's own presence, but civil society also beckons them in. \*\*usually over a concern that no-one can be against\*\*

>While recognition of deep race and class disparities inherent in pro-criminalization strategies may have impeded investment in crime control, the suppression of these differences under a gender essentialist framework facilitated the continued adherence to carceral strategies as a central feature of feminist anti-violence movements...

ie: It's far easier to sell authoritarianism to liberals and leftists through Feminism than Racism.

>Growing research, largely focused on third party policing, provides empirical evidence of how civil society actors, such as parents (Mazerolle and Ransley 2005), landlords (Desmond 2016), and hospitals (Lara-Millan 2014) have been recruited into the functions of surveillance and punishment. These studies emphasize the coercive dynamics of carceral recruitment and demonstrate the process of annexing non- state actors as crime control functions become institutionalized into everyday practices.

I got into Social Work because I grew up homeless. I can't express how disgusted I was when I found out that Feminists and Courts had gladly weaponized evictions and poverty to enforce ideology on the working poor, for whom evictions or restraining orders can ruin their life.

\*Progressive elements are eroded and destroyed when a majority is empowered by working with the State. Feminist criticism of the rise of social justice as state violence fell on deaf ears.

\*A weak social welfare state could be responsible for a proportional rise of carceral policies.

&#x200B;

>As legal theorists Brown and Halley (2002) warn, rights-based success can paradoxically transform social movement victors into unwitting agents of the state. With these forms of contentious politics, “once you win, you are the state” (p. 10).

Mimi's paper goes into depth on Feminists efforts to infiltrate the State and write policy that would punish Men for the crimes they imagined poor women to be suffering every day. One of the most interesting parts of the paper is a chart showing the tactics Feminists used to gain entry, so I made it an [image.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Billy-Batdorf/comments/hcnmdg/mimi_kim_three_methods_of_feminist_infiltration/) 

\*The classic argument that ""X affects All Women!"", even though it is factually wrong was central to infiltrating law enforcement

\*Feminists exploited race, gender, and class to make arguments that only criminalization would work - rather than seeking to undo the root problems.

Mimi clearly establishes fault and responsibility with Feminists:

>The consequences of these social movement choices extend beyond the confines of carceral feminism. By inviting carceral actors into new hybrid organizational forms, these strategies contributed to the architecture undergirding the construction of the expanding punitive state. Collaborative strategies legitimizing the key role of the criminal justice system and their accompanying gender, race, and class justifications forged the foundations for enduring frames and strategic directions that bolstered public support for pro-criminalization legislation and muted feminist opposition to carceral expansion. This narrative continued for at least three decades, fixing the feminist gaze on the promise of carceral protections at the expense of more emancipatory movement directions.

Feminists know this and accept it even while paying lipservice to #AbolishPolice, #BlackLivesMatter, etc. They created and supported the policies that lead to this. One of the chief architects of the 90s crime bills, and VAWA, in addition to pro-segregation laws: Joe Biden, has a current lead with Liberal Women.

>Despite today’s critique of carceral feminism, demands for crime legislation to curb violence targeting oppressed groups such as LGBTQ communities and religious minorities have readily adopted the pro-criminalization frame promoted by feminist anti-violence strategies (Jenness and Grattet 2001; Spade 2015). Establishment of a Community Coordinated Response is now a familiar criterion for federal funding and has been implemented within jurisdictions in all 50 states and 13 countries abroad (Gondolf 2010). The most recent reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act in 2013 again tied federal funding for new campus sexual violence programming to participation in a Community Coordinated Response.

Mimi ends on the note that the idea of removing the collaboration between feminists and law enforcement is becoming more common in feminist communities. But here we are a year after her article, during a time of massive unrest over State Violence and there is no sense of responsibilities for these policies. In fact, many popular Feminists have managed to make a majority male problem about themselves - which will lead to more violence as they again turn this into an exaggerated threat that 'all women' face. White Men face more police violence than Black Women by hundreds of times, Black Men and White Women are virtually opposites when it comes to sentencing and Prison population, the idea that you can either be Feminist or be silent on an issue that is overwhelmingly male is just straight up oppression propaganda.

I would make the point that every political group has fallen into this same trap, but may have failed to infiltrate or exploit the politics of privilege to this extent. The left fell for the 'sex trafficking' demand for international authority, Feminism as a justification for war in the Middle East, Liberals fell for the same but also Bill Clinton's tough-on-crime bloodthirst, and the Right exaggerates property crime or Anti-Semitism to such epidemic proportions that they ended up censoring freedom of speech on campuses and on private property more than every SJW combined. See [criminalizing activism against israeli occupation](https://theintercept.com/2016/02/16/greatest-threat-to-free-speech-in-the-west-criminalizing-activism-against-israeli-occupation/) and  [free speech in the age of social media](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/the-ongoing-challenge-to-define-free-speech/in-the-age-of-socia-media-first-amendment/) . You're not going to get what you want when you collaborate with the Capitalist State. You're going to end up betraying your principles and causing harm.

The police murders we have, though terrible, are also only the tip of the visible iceberg. We have millions in prison, while allowing private industry to profit from prison slave labor. We have immense economic inequality where wealth is still primarily inherited while labor rights and wages continue to fall and rents and costs of living go up. We have people who make only slightly more than their rent costs losing their jobs because of CPS mandatory child possession, Police mandatory arrests, and permanent records from fraudulent or exaggerated protection orders.

Hundreds of thousands of people gain a restraining order on their record every year and only 40% of these are said to be legitimate. The abuse of restraining orders is actually becoming a bigger issue because Feminists have silently been working to justify the use of said orders to [censor people on social media](http://hrlr.law.columbia.edu/files/2019/06/HRLR-50.3-Bennett-Thick-Enough-to-Stop-a-Bullet.pdf) from talking about their own lives. imagine working in a field to help people where your primary client is themselves an abuser. It punishes the poor, doesn't really affect anyone who can afford a lawyer, and rich celebrities abuse the system to get rid of competitors and people they don't like:  [very long read](https://medium.com/@laurenspitzberg/holy-shit-this-is-insane-eb9745f0eac3) .

Even outside of the carceral state, Feminists have labored ceaselessly to ensure that private interest will be antagonistic to workers who don't toe the line of Feminist thought. We then end up in this massive contradictory loop where the very FEminists who created the system that murdered George Floyd are simultaneously declaring everyone who opposes them to be racists, but also continuing to fight for the right for white women like amy cooper to call the cops and have offending males murdered for existing wrong

I don't know if anyone has actually taken an interest in Social Work, but after reading a study on how overwhelming poor the problem of domestic violence is (rather than gendered), it became clear to me that one of the biggest problems is an inability to walk away and find new housing. This fact has no actualy presence among Feminist anti-DV advocates and they have never genuinely fought for it as they have for their own power. This is a country where you're required to pay for legal representation, and it's so expensive that most americans can't afford it and we're supposed to believe that Class isn't important. Class is the greatest indicator of Domestic Violence and how much you will suffer for it. The Rich Women who made everything worse clearly cannot comprehend this.

Of course if you've ever paid attention to Men's issues, the most glaring issue with everything I posted above is that even while Feminists try to keep their movement pure of Carceral influence- they still say absolutely nothing about the simple fact that Women commit the same crimes at the same rates. (Often within one standard deviation). So many of these policies actually enhanced domestic violence by allowing some of the worst abusers to exploit the carceral system; police, family courts, prisons: as a tool of their abuse. I would be among the people who say that the costs of bringing these in far outweighs the benefits, and so Feminists have ultimately made IPV worse not better. But this depends on whether or not you actually cared about Domestic Violence, or if it was all a cynical ploy to take power. There is no possibility of these Feminists involved with protests actually wanting to abolish the current legal system, they profit too much from it and designed too much of it.

I actually agree with the sentiment of abolishing the police, with the exception that you can't just let the same carceral intersectional feminists to come in again claming to 'heal communities' they destroyed simply by playing race politics. It would need to be pro-male and pro-working class by design, because we're [overwhelmingly](https://www.reddit.com/user/Billy-Batdorf/comments/hcnll5/the_ignored_chart_of_the_month/) the victims of this system.",Billy-Batdorf,t2_59gg519o,0.98,107,22

611,1aiow81,2024-02-04,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Seeing the genuine wrong vs the prioritization of woman's comfort over men,"Idk if anyone else gets these feeling sometimes as this is something I've been thinking about recently.

I joined a new social group that's pretty left leaning by nature and I hadn't been kicked out yet, but there was a moment where I asked a female member there a question that I thought was normal at the time but she was very defensive when I casually asked her (I was made aware of this a couple weeks later after it was all said and done). At the time, I couldn't figure out if it was a social blunder on my part or just something personal specifically to her idk, but I was already used to people nonverbally hinting they're uncomfortable (something I was never good at picking up until after reading a shit ton of social books) and even though I'm at a level where I can read reactions, I very much hated looking deep into them and remember going crazy overthinking gestures and thinking ""why the fuck couldn't they just tell me what was bothering them."" and I still very much feel like this today.

At that moment I decided if that's how they're gonna be, then I'm gonna interact with them as less as possible and focus on other members of the group and not go on that topic much longer. It was a couple weeks after I decided this that I was then verbally told by her bf that what I had asked her was not the right time and place which means now I know it was a social blunder on my part (and he was pretty much understanding at the time.) I acknowledged my mistake and we talked it out, so as of yday we're both moving on from that incident.

However, there was a thought I had in my mind I couldn't really let go of. It's this feeling of general left-leaning groups prioritizing the feelings of women's comfort over men. I can't help but think if they thought I was an individual who just made an honest mistake, or they see a bad man just waiting to slip out of the cracks so they have an 'excuse' to pounce on.

I have been thinking of this due to being aware of women going to other women for their approval of men, male feminist pandering to them in leftist circles, and a lot of this is done behind your back so it's like they want to keep you in the dark so you're least likely to protect yourself.

So sometimes I wonder at what point do I consider these are genuine mistakes I made, or it's just gaslighting to make you think you're the bad guy for completely normal due to the left demonizing men a lot?

I feel like being called out for genuine wrongdoing and the male demonizing produce the exact same feelings and I feel it will hinder my ability to differentiate between the 2 and hold myself accountable for the genuine mistakes I have made and make me more unreasonably resentful of women or left-leaning spaces.

I wonder if anyone else gets this feeling sometimes and how they handle it.

EDIT: I'm not asking if what I did was right or wrong I already know what I did was wrong (inappropriate even) and made that clear in my post. What I'm asking for is if anyone else gets this FEELING sometimes regardless of any specific action done.",MSHUser,t2_b36t0jl8,0.79,59,35

In fact let me highlight this point, **that responsibility asymmetry is getting so far-fetched, that even marginalized men are losing their ''oppression'' cards.

That means their legal protection resources are going to not even work for them only in a matter of several years to come.** 

&#x200B;

Is not so much that society allows for women to be irresponsible and co-dependent, is moreso that feminism is working to keep this momentum strong, and is pushing for a weaponization of male laboral duty and male personal responsibility. This is why a lot of feminists always throw socially-darwinistic and fiscally conservative cards at men's issues, *women fought for their sovereignty, why don't men stop barking at eachother's throats and do something about their lack of group sovereignty* basically implying men have to work for their own causes instead of pushing for public funding and political awareness 

&#x200B;

**And if you wanna see an example of ''oppressed'' men losing their opression cards, look at how feminists are always hyping up stories of MOC always being predatory towards women in general, but in a given context they try to always look for inter-gender crimes such as a black man assaulting a white woman or a Hispanic man going after a black woman so they can intensify the shock value. A lot of black feminists are also always accusing black men of not only keeping white supremacy alive, but as well as misogyny, homophobia, transphobia and ableism, even though how can black men be accused of such thing, when the average black man doesn't EVEN have the same level of political bargaining power as a FEMINIST.**

# Why is this relevant for men?

Because paid menstrual leave causes a defacto pay gap, where men get paid less for the same work as they are not afforded the same amount of paid days off.

If it is unpaid on the other hand, it increases the (false) pay gap that feminists have been lamenting, and also gives women massively more flexibility, even if they do not suffer from debilitating period pain, that men don't have. Having a well-paying job and being able to trade some money for a long weekend is a huge advantage, whereas a man who can't or doesn't want to work that much is forced to choose a lower-paying job with fewer or more flexible hours.",lightning_palm,t2_7exrq0w2,0.94,132,84
619,uimv8i,2022-05-05,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,On Risk-Taking,"Where I live (Ontario), men pay significantly more for auto insurance than women.  When this was contested in the courts, the justification the government gave  for this gender-based discrimination was that its fine for men to pay more because ""science says that men take more risks"".

OK then.

But why is that the end of it?  If it is agreed upon that women are less risk-tolerant than men, then why can't we apply that concept to the following:

1) There are more male mass shooters.

Obviously people with a mental illness are more likely to go on a shooting spree if they are more likely to take risks.

2) There are more male criminals.

Same.

3) There are more men saving people from burning buildings (etc).

If men deserve scorn for being more likely to shoot up a school, then they deserve praise for being more likely to risk their life to save others.

4) There are more male CEO's

Starting your own business is a huge risk, to say the least.

5) There are more male elected representatives.

You can't hold political power if you don't run for office.  Running for office is a HUGE risk though - you can spend enormous amounts of time/money/reputation and still never get the job.  

If you're going to tell me that the reason the government is mostly male is because females are discriminated against then I'm going to point to the auto-insurance laws and say ""nope, men are just more willing to risk it"".

And if you're going to tell me that men aren't more risk-tolerant than women, then I have to ask:  Why are we paying more for car insurance?",Beljuril-home,t2_60u4n30i,1.0,42,30
620,gid96g,2020-05-12,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,"The ""unpaid domestic work"" issue is a dishonest smoke screen which is only tangentially about gender, is really about personality.","There's only one fact that applies to literally all homes with two adults where one person does more domestic duties than the other: the person who does the extra work consistently, is highly likely to score high for trait conscientiousness in a psychometric test.

It *tends* to be true that more women than men score highly on conscientiousness. It *is* true that as a person becomes more towards the extreme end of conscientious, they are more likely to be dictatorial, rigid and fanatical. The extreme example of the lack of conscientiousness is a heroin junky, just crashing life, lying casually, utterly incapable of being reliable.

But as you get more life experience you meet the couples where the man's the straight edge, and his wife's just a whirlwind of chaos.

The problem is that this is one of the big 5 personality traits. The ones that don't change much. That means that for individuals, a broad small improvement is the very best possible outcome. And there's plenty of men and women on both sides.

So any movement to compensate people for lazy spouses must also include compensation for the hundreds of millions of men in the world who spend life picking up after the woman they love. If we can't just be adult about it and trust the couples to find the balance that works best for themselves.

Highly conscientious spouses are often very hard to tolerate because they forever point out your mistakes without ever giving you a break. Highly conscientious people get dumped a lot.",czerdec,t2_qo1hq,0.86,52,64
621,xuxk2s,2022-10-03,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Who perceives women's rights as threatening to men and boys? Explaining modern sexism among young men in Europe,"Came across [this study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpos.2022.909811/full) and was wondering about people's thoughts. I'm not going to go through all of it, but there are w couple of points I wanted to talk about. 

> Further in line with our argument, young men who perceive institutions in their regions to be unfair react more strongly to this perceived competition and express more sexism, as they are more likely to consider this competition to be unfair1. Finally, young men residing in regions that record recent increases in unemployment will express more sexism due to the increased competition in the labor market, which they may perceive to be further aggravated by increasing women's labor force participation 

We have evidence that boys receiving lower grades for the same work, so I would like to know why they think this level of unfairness is only perceived. 

> We do not find that the level of threat perception of advances in women's rights among young men depends on the context of “actual” fairness. Rather, it is the individual-level perception that matters most for our findings. 

It finds that boys who are in poverty are more likely to see the system as being unfair against them. They don't ever give it much credit that the system could actually be unfair. With more social support for girls, with different social drives to get women in stem and also a lack of social drive to get men into fields which they are under represented in. Could it be that the system is actually unfair (particularly) against boys who are already struggling? After reading the boy crisis and multiple studies, this paper doesn't ask whether the perceptions could be true. Considering research contributed by this sub does support such assertions. 

Finally, this is how the paper defines sexism: 

> According to Manne (2017, 79), “sexism should be understood primarily as the ‘justificatory’ branch of a patriarchal order, which consists in ideology that has the overall function of rationalizing and justifying patriarchal social relations”, where the patriarchal order is characterized by women being “positioned as subordinate in relation to some man or men...
> ... It is based on the perception that gender equality is already established and further anti-discrimination laws or measures to promote women would result in special favors toward women. 

So, if someone has the above perception, it is automatically assumed that they think women should be dominated. I don't know, the perception could just be based on actual unfair treatment. Asking questions such as this to define sexist attitudes: 

> Advancing women's and girls' rights has gone too far because it threatens men's and boys' opportunities 

So just from a brief read through, it looks to me like this paper has defined sexism via a biased description. Applied it wholesale to anyone who sees modern institutions as unfair and rather than question that unfairness, just saying that this is perceived because men want to dominate women. It couldn't be that young men are being unfairly treated by modern (toxic and regressive) ideals of equality but rather it is just perception. Forgetting the fact that older generations of men would have grown up in a world before the rise of modern patriarchy theory in institutions. 

This is only going to get worse if people keep ignoring the conditions these boys are actually being raised in. I think that if you want the trend of younger men going toward the right to continue, this is the exact kind of narrative they should keep pushing. These boys need support, not vilification.

They then unfortunately removed it for  ""Suggesting redpill ideology to leave blackpilled ideology"" and the mods then banned me when I offered to rework it as long as they gave some clarification on how exactly they felt it was doing that. 

Seems as though we don't have the same end goal in mind. But alas. I shall post it here.




***

Right now I'm a man with a girlfriend who's learned how to be successful with dating. Not gonna give you my life story but here's some critiques I've picked up from being on ""both sides"" of the proverbial fence..

So. I spent a lot of my youth in a shitty way. Got bullied heavily and was forced into special Ed with legitimately mentally handicapped people who smeared shit on the walls among other excretions. So because I was in with them it was assumed I was like them. and so I had to deal with a shitty small town community where people who brushed up against me in the halls would recoil in disgust. Though I always had friends (mostly girls FYI). My social circles were often thin and heavy bullying made me distance myself from people who may make the bullying worse. It wasn't until highschool that I found a consistent social circle I felt comfortable around. This didn't last long but that's not relevant.

Needless to say. I hated the advice to focus on friends as if that would sate my need for intimacy. Having friends of either gender that aren't afraid to hug or whatnot is great.

But most friends don't cuddle. They don't kiss. They don't hold one another skin to skin until they fall asleep in bed. They don't dig their nails into your back pulling you in because they want to be close to you. They don't casually have sex.

It's like the difference between eating a hard boiled egg and an omelette. You're still eating an egg but one is better.

And here's the thing. A massive part of why I struggled getting that intimacy is because I was terrified of expressing my desire for it.

That's why losing my V card was a legitimate turning point. I realized that when I expressed my desires and made the first move it would lead to people reciprocating that. But I was terrified of doing so because it was hammered into my head that women hated being approached by guys. And that socially awkward guys creeped women out.

I didn't want to be ""that guy"" so I never approached or expressed interest.

BUT. we still live in a world where men are expected to make the first move. There's exceptions, sure. But that's the way it is for most of us. And we aren't given a manual on how to do this so it's trial and error. And guys who are starting to learn late in life are going to seem creepy to people who got past the awkward shit in their teenage years.

And there's not many options aside from just accepting that you're going to be disliked and chugging along through it. Or finding some sort of guide.

Now to preface. I do not advocate for people joining toxic communities to escape inceldom. In fact I'd prefer that there be better avenues to do so. But in order for that to happen we must analyze what makes these toxic communities attractive and how more mainstream advice is failing people. 

The problem is that a lot of the ""entry-level"" advice in these toxic communities is actually good advice that helps many guys who are suffering from the ""nobody wants to date me"" problem. For example,

* Take concrete steps to make yourself more physically attractive.
* Be more confident and outgoing.
* Don't be a carpet for women to walk over.
* (Almost all) women prefer men who perform traditional masculinity to some extent.

These might sound obvious but there are a lot of guys who I think don't get it. Unfortunately these toxic communities add this whole other bad ideology, so once the guys see the above steps working, they buy into the rest of the ideology. 

That's why I wish there was more ""left-wing"" dating advice communities that gave advice like the above. Unfortunately in those places the responses you often get to guys struggling in dating is like

* You aren't entitled to women's bodies
* Make yourself better first
* Who cares if you're a virgin, you should be happy anyway
* Read literature by women

Those things are all true but they're also completely unhelpful. Like, if I'm sad and lonely and want a girlfriend, I want to figure out how to get a girlfriend. I already know I'm not entitled to a girlfriend (else why wouldn't I already have one?) Tell me something I can do to improve my chances. ""How to date ethically as a male feminist"" is great and all but the guide they're really looking for is ""How to get a date"" and if toxic communities are the only place that gives them a functional guide, that's where they'll go.

I know this on a personal level since when I was in that place in my life. They offered me advice that I wasn't finding anywhere else. That's why I went to them.

And that's an underlying issue that I think needs to be addressed if we really want to help people. I think it is really difficult for neurotypical people to understand the difficulties that come with dating in today's landscape. SO many of the pieces of advice are literally completely off the mark, and often come across as extremely condescending. Either because they imply that something extremely basic and frankly disgusting is the core of the issue (""have you tried showering more?"") or they immediately jump to talking about how to behave once you are already actively in a relationship - assuming that the acquaintance -> first date process is trivial. Spoiler, for at least some people it is absolutely not trivial. It feels easy and natural to some people, so they fail to examine what that interaction actually entails and how it could go wrong in a way that doesn't stem from either social isolation or antisocial views.

I didn't get to practice or learn how to talk to girls in a flirty way because by the time I hit puberty girls my age in my home town thought I was disgusting/annoying. Literally the closest thing to romantic success in those early years was from people who didn't know me growing up. I didn't have my first date until I was living on my own in a different city. And I had to learn how to be flirty from online forums because more ""popular"" advice was to do shit like ""treat women like humans"" or ""be friends with more women"" as if I wasn't already doing that consistently.

Which brings me to the next thing in this post. . Though my social circles haven't always been robust. There is a common factor. I've almost always had more female friends than male friends. I don't and never have liked typically masculine hobbies like sports or cars. So I gravitated towards more feminine things.

I've never had an issue being friends with women or seeing them as people. That was just the default.

I had an issue where I was always told that I shouldn't pester women. That they didn't want to constantly be hit on and asked out by guys. And that if I wanted a relationship I should just be nice and ""treat them like humans"" and relationships will bloom from that organically. They don't. There may be people who get lucky. But there's many who don't. And like said it's still very much expected that men make the first move.

Finally I'm going back to the friends thing. Dating via social circle is great. Congratulations to anybody that can do that.

But some social circles aren't constantly evolving. Some are very much a tight knit group of more or less introverted people who don't go out much. And are already in relationships. When every party is made up of the same ten or so people. You're not exactly going to have a lot of opportunities to meet single women. And not every person has interests or financial situations that align with meeting a lot of new people

For example. I like gaming. But I don't like the majority of online games.

I like cooking. But I'm self taught and every time I've looked into classes they've been for things I can already make. Why would I pay money to go to a class where I won't learn anything just so I can be a distraction for others because I wanna make friends.

I like concerts but for the most part artists that I'm into only come to my city once or twice a year.

I'm into nerdy stuff but convention tickets are expensive.

Same shit bleeds over into jobs. I know the common ""work relationships aren't worth it"" but I'm talking about social networking via a job.

Sometimes it ain't easy. I've worked retail jobs where I barely knew the names of my coworkers because I was the guy stuck doing the grunt work nobody else wanted to do. I've worked industry jobs where the majority of my coworkers were 20+ years older than me and on an assortment of drugs that's only matched by the crackhead outside my apartment that's having a shouting match with what's left of a bike.

All In all.

As much as advice like

""Treat women like humans""

""Have female friends""

Isn't great because it assumes that this isn't already the case. Too often the assumption is that struggling with dating is due to a moral failure. But from what I've seen it's most often not.

""Try more social hobbies""

Isn't great advice because access to social hobbies isn't a given for everybody. Particularly if they never had a chance to explore them.

To use an analogy. Imagine you move to a new city. You have zero friends. You don't really know your way around and you've never experienced living here.

And you wanna join a LARP group. So you check social media. And there aren't any active groups that you can find. So what do you do? Go stand in a park with your foam sword and shield and wait for challengers?

Some people more fluent in navigating these circles would know to maybe check shops or where to ask around. But this is underlying knowledge and experience that most people take for granted

""Just be yourself""

Isn't great because if ""just being yourself"" worked for everybody they wouldn't be asking for advice.

""Don't just look for sex"" ""Sex doesn't matter""

Isn't great because sex does matter. It's a form of intimacy that you don't get from platonic friends. This is not to say that you should go door to door asking people to have sex with you. But you need to be open about your desire in order for the world to know you have that desire.

""Get your needs met through your friends"" And etc. May sound pleasant and effective.

A lot of times it isn't.

Sex does matter. Relationships matter. Generally the only way for friends to meet romantic needs is if you're in a polyamorous kind of thing with them. And then they're not really ""just friends"" any more.

A lot of advice is from people who haven't actually struggled. And just assume struggling is due to a moral failure when it's often much more complicated.

That's about all I have to say.

To TL;DR

a lot of advice I see given to incels is based on idealism when it needs to come from a place of realism. Much of what pushed me towards the nastier incel beliefs was the fact that the people reiterating them spoke more to my lived experiences than anybody trying to move me in the opposite direction.

If we want to help incels we need to understand what brought them to where they are instead of assuming.",Forgetaboutthelonely,t2_n40fp,0.95,96,150

I was having a good time, drinking and talking to strangers in my favorite bar. This girl joins the conversation, saying she is a camerawomen and we talked about her profession. She complained about the ubiquitous sexism, saying that men often think she is just holding the camera for the real guy and that she gets hit on all the time, even though she is a lesbian, etc. I can certainly believe her experience. We talked about gay rights and other issues when I said I am actually a men's rights activist..

- Sorry what?

- A men's rights activist.

- Whaaaaaat? You are whaaaat? A - m e n s - r i g h t s - a c t i v i s t ?

- Yes, a men's rights activist.

- Is that a joke?? Men have aaaaall the rights! Why would men want even more rights?


To my surprise I stayed calm and I think I sobered up a little :). I started to explain that men face range of issues but my new friend wanted to hear none of it, saying that women face issues, gay people face issues, but what men face are simply human issues that all other people face too. I felt fire eating me inside but I stayed calm and smiling and I started to explain various issues only men face in society. My new friend listened for a while when she got hooked on the issue with acces to mental healthcare, suddenly remembering someone from her past. Her expression changed and she said that it is true that men face issues with access to mental health care and that she must google these 'men's rights'. I gave her last bit of advice to keep her eyes open and distinguish betwelnn real MRA and all kind of misogynist haters, incels and other ""conservatives"" :). 


That's it. I don't think I changed her outlook too much, but maybe I gave her little something to think about.

626,ni07sv,2021-05-21,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Subjective Interpretation of “Objective” Video Evidence: Perceptions of Male Versus Female Police Officers’ Use-of-Force,"This study from April 2020 (https://content.apa.org/fulltext/2020-17958-001.html) looked at how participants perceived one and the same video of police force depending on what gender they believed the officer to be. They also had another group watch a segment containing no force. Remember that you are currently on reddit. The link to the full article is provided above - this post will only present parts of and is not meant to replace it.

### The journal:

>This journal is a publication of APA Division 41 (American Psychology-Law Society) https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/lhb/

As such, it is peer-reviewed:

>Like other scientific journals, APA journals utilize a peer review process to guide manuscript selection and publication decisions. https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/resources/peer-review

### Measured variables: 
* Trust in the officer, 
* Perceived officer effectiveness and 
* internal (the officer’s emotional reactivity, being a violent person, aggressiveness) vs. external (e.g., the dangerousness of the situation, the suspect’s behavior) attributions.

### Participants and sample size:

>We recruited a total of 637 MTurk workers, but excluded 185 (29%) participants for failing (a) manipulation checks of officer gender (n = 45, 7%); (b) officer race (n = 113, 18%); and/or (c) attention checks (n = 81, 13%). The remaining 452 participants were 53% female and 80% White, 7% Hispanic/Latino, 6% African American, and 7% other (Mage = 37.6 years, SD = 11.44).

### The video:

>We told participants that they would see a brief video of an interaction between a police officer and civilian and then complete a series of questions about the impressions they formed about the encounter and the officer involved. After reading a description of the incident, we showed participants a photograph and told them it was the officer that they would be seeing in a video of the incident, who had 7 years of experience. They viewed the police–civilian interaction video and completed dependent measures in the order listed below. Participants viewed the video a second time halfway through the measures and we presented the photo of the officer before each set of measures. [...]
All participants saw a segment of video from the same interaction involving an officer responding to a call about a person acting disorderly. We found the video online; to our knowledge, the video is not from a famous case. We asked participants if they recognized the officer and none of the participants did. Participants were randomly assigned to see a segment depicting the officer either (a) talking to the suspect without using force (58 s); or (b) talking to the suspect and then throwing the suspect to the ground and wrestling with him (60 s). The video contained no sound. The low-resolution video was far enough away that the lack of detail makes the race and gender of the officer unclear, but the use-of-force and motion was obvious. The suspect’s gender was relatively more visible than the officer’s because the suspect was wearing shorts and light clothing, which made his body form and size relatively more visible than the officer, who wore dark pants and long sleeves against a dark background. At the end of the study we asked participants to guess the suspect’s gender and race. The race of the suspect was unclear (47% said White, 32% said African American, 3% said Hispanic, 18% said they could not remember), but it was much more clear that the suspect was male (98% said male). Because both videos are different segments of the same interaction, the setting and individuals were constant across conditions.



### Significant findings:

#### Trust in officer:

|  no force | force | participant gender |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|  ""As predicted, when officers did not use force, the officers’ gender did not affect how much participants trusted them.""    |    ""However, when officers did use force, participants trusted female officers significantly more than male officers. The race and intersectional effects were not significant.""    |   ""The analysis demonstrated that the Officer Gender × Force interaction did not depend on participant gender (i.e., the three-way interaction was not significant). Further, the Officer Gender × Force interaction reported above (*to the left in this table*) remained significant in this analysis that controlled for participant gender.""   |  



| participant gender | both force conditions |
|:------:|:------:|
|   female participants   |    ""There was a significant two-way interaction between participant gender and officer gender (regardless of whether the officer used force).

|    male participants    |    ""whereas male participants trusted female (M = 4.28, SD = .15) and male (M = 4.48, SD = .14) officers to a similar degree.""    |

#### Perceived effectiveness:

|    male participants    |    ""whereas male participants perceived female (M = 4.45, SD = .13) and male (M = 4.66, SD = .12) officers to be similarly effective.""    |

#### Attribution of force:

| Effects & Mediators | Force |
|:------:|:------:|
|Attributions and trust|""More specifically, when a male (compared with a female) officer used force, participants thought his behavior was driven less by the situation and more by something internal to him. In turn, both of these factors were significantly associated with participants trusting him less than a female officer (see Figure 3).""|
|Attributions and effectiveness|""When a male (compared with a female) officer used force, participants thought his behavior was driven less by the situation and more by something internal to him. In turn, both of these factors were significantly associated with participants perceiving him to be less effective than a female officer.""|
|Mediators -> perception|""More specifically, the effect of officer gender affected trust in and perceptions of the officer through all four of the mediators: Participants perceived male (vs. female) officers who use force as more driven by internal factors, more emotionally reactive, more aggressive, and less driven by the situation and, in turn, all of these factors explained unique variance in trust in and perceptions of the officer.""|

>Although we believe that the order of psychological processes that we tested in these models are intuitive and supported by decades of theoretical support for attribution theory (Fiske & Taylor, 1991; Weiner, 1986, 2006), we cannot infer that different attributions ***cause*** changes in trust in and perceptions of the officer given that both our mediators and outcomes were measured. Thus, we conducted additional models that reversed the order of our outcomes and mediators. (It is important to note that we could not run truly parallel models because we originally ran a dual-mediator model, whereas we had to run two separate single-mediator models to test the impact of each outcome on each of the two mediators.)

|Perception -> mediators|""We found that our indirect effects were also significant when we reversed the order of the mediators and outcomes (see Supplemental Table S5). That is, we found that when a male (vs. female) officer exerted force, the degree to which participants endorsed internal and external explanations for that force operated through their trust in the officer and their perceptions of the officer. For example, participants trusted male (vs.) female officers less, and in turn that decreased trust was associated with making more internal and less external attributions. We found similar patterns for perceptions of the officer as a mediator.""|

### Inconsistency with role congruity theory:

>Women who engaged in a traditionally masculine behavior (exerting physical force) were trusted more and perceived to be more effective than a man engaging in the same behavior. This is particularly surprising, given that role congruity theory predicts that the more masculine the domain, the greater the backlash would be—pointing out the military as an example (Eagly & Karau, 2002).

### Naive Realism:

>The assumption that video provides objective evidence that will eliminate diverging opinions about whether the force was excessive represents a theorized “naïve realism.” More specifically, it represents the perception that photographic evidence is a direct representation of reality containing objective truth that everyone would agree on if they saw it with their own eyes (Feigenson & Spiesel, 2009). Yet, personal biases can pull interpretation of a videotaped event into alignment with one’s worldview.

### The justice system:

>The study also has bearing on our justice system, Salerno said. “We hope that everyone will be treated the same, but if jurors were looking at the video of the police using force it would seem that male officers might be punished more harshly than female officers. They’re all watching the same incident, but they might judge that person more harshly because they make different assumptions about what drives a male versus female officer’s aggressive behavior. It’s an example of how gender stereotypes can potentially lead to different outcomes.” https://news.asu.edu/20200320-discoveries-female-police-officers-use-force-seen-more-justified

### The authors making questionable statements:

The authors claim:

>Instead, our findings are consistent with a smaller number of studies demonstrating a gender contrast effect, which finds that in some circumstances people rate women who violate gender stereotypes more favorably than men. Although rare, these studies that show a gender contrast effect are important to document to try to determine what circumstances lead to women being able to demonstrate ***valued behaviors*** that are traditionally considered masculine without backlash for violating prescriptive gender stereotypes.

Valued behaviours you say? 

>Given the extensive press coverage of police officers’ use of lethal force, it is perhaps not surprising that people had much more negative reactions to officers who used force relative to those who did not. Female officers were buffered somewhat, however, against this backlash relative to male officers. Despite having seen the exact same video, people trusted the officer who used force more and thought the officer was more effective when they thought the officer was a woman relative to when they thought the officer was a man.

""They're not *real* feminists!""

""They're *actually* conservatives when you think about it.""

""How *dare* J.K. Rowling say people assigned male at birth are equally dangerous regardless of gender expression?!""

Because that's the sticking point; it's not the idea that J.K. Rowling thinks men as a group are dangerous. That's taken as writ. It's that some women might wind up collateral damage to that assumption.

The difference between TERFs and regular feminists is that one is a group who hold feelings of mistrust and disgust for a class of people based on immutable aspects of their personhood, and the other continues to hate those people even if they identify as female.

I think the reason feminists in general have such ire for TERFs is that they're way, way too close to regular feminists. It incites a feeling of the uncanny valley; ""These people profess the same ideals I do, so why are *they* bigots?""

The answer is, because you're all bigots. You're all ""actually conservatives, when you think about it"", at least in certain areas. TERFs are just working off a infinitesimally different ""approved"" list of who can be targeted for bigotry.

Is there a way we can point this out in discourse without coming off so confrontationally that people automatically shut down?

This is my response:

&#x200B;

>I do think men face problems that specific to men, but I think it's men's job to fix it. Like spreading different healthy body types for men or showing men how to be vulnerable. It's a problem that a men's movement built by men should solve.

it's man's job to fix it ? why ? why women's problems are the responsibility of all the society but the men's problems are the responsibility of men only.

Isn't that traditional gender roles ? by saying ""it's man's job to fix it"" you are saying to men just ""man up"" ! 

Men's problems need systemic solutions from policy makers. 

Showing men how to be vulnerable ? are you saying men are responsible for their own problems because they don't know how to be vulnerable ? that's victim blaming and also supremacy. men know how to be vulnerable. we are not stupid. the problem is that when we are vulnerable we don't get any help. people tell us ""man up"" (like you just did) 

Men show vulnerablity all the time, this is what the men's rights movement is about. but we get demonized for it by feminists, we get called ""whiners"" ""stop playing the victim"" ""women have it worse"" etc etc  .. 

For example in the US the anti domestic violence bill titled ""Violence Against Women Act"" and only women get services. this is institutional sexism. this is not the men's job to fix it. this is a civil rights issue. this is OUR job to fix it. yourself included. 

Here are some quotes from men who called abuse hotlines, taken from[National Parent’s organization](https://archive.fo/nLLs6#selection-439.0-459.269):

>They laughed at me and told me I must have done something to deserve it if it happened at all.  
>  
>Another said: They asked how much I weighed and how much she weighed and then hung up on me...I was told by this agency that I was full of BS.  
>  
>Twelve percent of the hotlines accused the man of being the batterer or responsible for the abuse. One abused man said:  
>  
>They told me women don't commit domestic violence -- it must have been my fault.  
>  
>Another said: They accused me of trying to hide my ""abuse"" of her by claiming to be a victim, and they said that I was nothing more than a wimp.  
>  
>Of the men who sought help by contacting local domestic violence programs, only 10% found them to be ""very helpful,"" whereas 65% found them to be ""not at all helpful."" One abused man said:  
>  
>They just laughed and hung up the phone.  
>  
>Another said: They didn't really listen to what I said. They assumed that all abusers are men and said that I must accept that I was the abuser. They ridiculed me for not leaving my wife, ignoring the issues about what I would need to do to protect my six children and care for them.

&#x200B;

Stop telling men that's their job to fix the problems, stop victim blaming, admit that institutional sexism against exist. accept that if you are pro equality it's your job to fix the problems. 

 "" It's the same way in our healthcare system, men die on average 5 years younger than women, they die more frequently of most of the top killer diseases. we have several national offices for women's health and we have nothing for men. if that's not bigotry. if that's not real deadly sexism, i don't know what is ! "" Paul Elam 

**This is how feminism hurt men, by victim blaming men and denying the existence is institutional sexism against men.**

&#x200B;

>I do think feminism has problems but I think it's more racism, classism and ableism being pushed as part of feminism, like how men of color or working class men existing is lumped with actual harassments when women talk about how men make them feel uncomfortable.

Saying men make them feel uncomfortable is not racism or classism. it is misandry. dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against men.

I see feminists say that men (ALL MEN not jus men of color or working class ) make them feel uncomfortable. 

This is why men's issues and men's rights are ignored, because you make them look as racial or class issue when in reality it's gender issue (men's issue) for example police brutality: **96% of the victims are men**, 86% of the homeless are men (read [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFjlZEeAgyS/) instagram post for more) 

**This is how feminism hurt men, by making men's issues invisible. by reclassifying male problems into other categories: social, racial, class, immigration, etc**

As explain Daniel Jimenez in ""Dehumanizing the male""  (read the book review [here](https://malepsychology.org.uk/2020/01/12/dehumanizing-the-male-by-daniel-jimenez-book-review/)) : 

&#x200B;

>Female problems are gendered, but male problems are not. Previously we talked about workplace fatalities. Well, if you read this article in the newspaper [ElDiario.es](https://ElDiario.es) you will realize that data segregated by sex is not provided. The article refers to “dead people” or “workers”. If you read it in Europa Press the same thing happens. But if you read it on RTVE and you have the patience to reach exactly the end of the last paragraph, you will find the sex segregation. Imagine that the numbers of male and female workers killed was the opposite (that is, 602 dead women and 50 men), do you think the media treatment would have been the same? Do you think that society’s and social agents’ response would have been the same? (that is, none) As Daniel repeats throughout the book, there is no gender spinning for men’s problems. If a problem or violence affects primarily women, it is a gendered problem, but the opposite does not happen.

You ask:

&#x200B;

>How do feminists interfere with men building a men's movement that's about helping men?

in different ways for example by insisting that the conversation on gender equality focus exclusively on women's rights and never men's rights. by insisting that the conversation on sexism focus exclusively on misogyny and never misandry. for example:

Some of you may have followed this saga so far, others not. This post should read the same for both. There is a lot more going on here than you see, but it doesn't need discussion. What I show you today is a Title IX coordinator, Jennifer Smith (say her fucking name), lying in an official Title IX ruling she issued. This case is special to me because it is the reason I became an activist.

While a student at A&M, for reasons that don't really matter, I suspected something nefarious was  going on within our Title IX department and submitted a series of complaints to find out what it was. The complaints were valid and filed in good faith.  What I uncovered was far more serious than what I expected was simple indifference. Their Title IX coordinator was issuing rulings that she knew to be false, and I obtained internal documents proving it. Don't take my word for it, you can see some of them for yourself in this post. Do consider though, that I am merely showing one example, and that it is not the only lie told by her department.

I had sent a letter similar to the one below to the A&M president's office and copied some relevant people including some members of compliance and risk. Kevin McGinnis, Vice President and Chief Risk Ethics and Compliance Officer, replied to that letter informing me I was previously notified that TAMU OGC's Jacob Becker is my contact for these complaints. I sent a letter to Mr. Becker this morning, you can read it below.

I have no idea how many lives she has ruined, or will ruin, with false rulings. Has this denied victims of rape finding justice in the Title IX process? Has this denied the wrongly accused justice? I read court cases against this school and I have a strong suspicion that I am not the only victim.

As you know, I am not just an advocate for men's rights, it is merely a focus and driving motivation. I would like to point out a recent lawsuit against A&M by a woman claiming to have been paid unfairly compared to her male counterparts. The filed case looks rather compelling and what really snagged my attention is that it says she submitted a complaint to the Title IX office and it wasn't investigated. She also claims that the school retaliated to her speaking up by cutting her contract short.

There was also a lawsuit by a guy back in 2020 that claims when his claim of a Title IX violation was submitted (regarding stuff under the sexual assault sections), that it was never official filed. This lack of an official filing was then used to deny consideration of his filing in the final hearing where he was found responsible for an event in which he thought he was the victim.

I am not the only one. I am not alone on this. So you know what, fucking #metoo. I am speaking for those that don't have a voice going through her sham Title IX department. I got the evidence they didn't have, and I want the nation to see it. I do have attorney, and I have been given permission to share information regarding this matter on social media, with the press etc. The school knows exactly who I am. The letters I send and my communications with the school are not done anonymously.

# ACTION

I sent the letter below to the school attorney. I encourage you to write your own letter of concern and send it to the Texas A&M Office of the President, M. Katherine Banks. I will let you look up the email on the school website. I copied her on this letter and also sent a slightly different one directly to her office yesterday.

1. Write to the President's Office of A&M, M. Katherine Banks, expressing concern.
2. Write to news agencies regarding the matter. Copy reporters on your email to the school president's office. I am willing to dox myself, give interviews on camera, statements etc. Whatever it takes.
3. Get real fucking loud on social media. Share this post and [my one in men's rights](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/zl99l6/a_public_demand_to_the_president_of_texas_am/).
4. [Give me some love on twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/mra_titleix), help boost the metrics that give me visibility.
5. Do not contact individuals within A&M. Only contact official offices relevant to your letter that have public contact information. As a mod here, I will have a swift and harsh response to anyone posting personal information of any party involved. Writing public offices and tagging of the institution on social media are the only acceptable methods.

We have a chance of real change,  and positive impact on the community at A&M by restoring a modicum of trust in their Title IX department. I can't sit on this any longer knowing that her false ruling may be ruining entire lives. It is time for some fucking sunshine. I have spent thousands of hours and dollars working this, significant amounts of sanity, and I believe it even delayed my graduation because my emails started going to spam the moment I began asking members of the administration questions. This was no small task, and I ask the community for support in demanding change. Make a comment with info about your contribution to change if you decide to help, but make the comment *after* you actually do it. If you care about fixing things, then take a moment today to help. Without your help, I fear this will simply continue.

**SUNSHINE IS THE BEST ANTISEPTIC FOR CORRUPTION.**

# LETTER

Mr. Becker \[school attorney with the office of general council\],

I am demanding the immediate termination of Jennifer Smith's employment for issuing Title IX rulings she knows are false. We have her internal emails as well as school emails with federal investigators, both obtained legally via FOIA, which conclusively show she has issued rulings she knew to be materially false. She has objectively lied in the core determination when issuing those rulings (one example attached). This casts doubt on every ruling she was a part of and has exposed the University to an unfathomable amount of liability given her position as Assistant Vice President for Compliance, and Title IX Coordinator. A&M may soon find itself in litigation over every student who went through her Title IX tribunals, or anyone who wrote a Title IX complaint to her department. I monitor Pacer and contact anyone who files a Title IX lawsuit against the school and if they are interested, I provide them with the relevant documentation, have a phone call to walk through it, inform them how to obtain it for use in court, and offer to testify. I have also contacted law firms who have previously sued you in court and had phone calls to discuss the evidence for use with future clients of theirs, for which they were very grateful. This will not go away if you ignore it and will pose a mounting liability to the school.

There are multiple cases with the Dept. of Ed. Office of Civil Rights regarding this matter which are being handled by multiple field offices, one case alleges felonies occurred as the school may have lied to federal investigators during a related investigation. By the actions of the school, this has ballooned into such a monstrosity that a Chief Regional Attorney for OCR is now involved with the cases and these cases have attracted the attention of a federal senator and congressional rep who have written letters to OCR regarding the matter. I have also discussed this with my congressional elect who then gave me his personal number and an invitation to coffee as things develop. There is a very real chance that all federal funding may be pulled from the University, I will be pushing for it so long as Ms. Smith remains employed at A&M. For this, I am getting traction given the school's egregious dereliction to compliance.

Ms. Smith has corrupted a public position of trust. Swift action is expected. Several reporters interested in the story have been copied. One outlet has already said they will go forward with the tell-all story. An activist ally of mine with a network list of several thousand reporters is working his contacts for additional publications. What the headline looks like will be entirely dependent on the school's response to this.

An Aggie does not lie, cheat, steal or tolerate those who do. These are more than words to me, and a tradition I am intent on upholding. Can the school say the same?

In contrast to decades ago when most LGBT community organizations were cash-strapped, today at least some are sitting on lots of money. Most of this money comes directly from gay men and/or from government and other sources of grants.

This has facilitated hiring in nonprofit organizations that were historically volunteer-run. But in my experience gay men (again, especially gay white men) have not benefited from this availability of funds in the form of new employment opportunities. In fact, sometimes straight white women are prioritized in employment in gay organizations (including ones built over decades by gay white men's volunteer labor). A case in point is [The ArQuives](https://arquives.ca/) in Toronto (formerly the Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives).

Given the negative attitudes towards gay men in the larger LGBT community (as shown in Ben Appel's [The Re-Demonization of the Gay Male](https://www.queermajority.com/essays-all/the-re-demonization-of-the-gay-male)), I am wondering how widespread this employment discrimination against gay men within the LGBT community is.

637,ltkrj3,2021-02-27,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,I feel very conflicted about voluntary single moms in the welfare state.,"I live in Denmark, a country well-known for its high taxes, generous welfare system and organized labor market. I think its great that we have laws and collective agreements that help out families, and especially single moms and dads. For example many workers in Denmark, have the opportunity to take the first 2 days off work if your child is sick, and even more days if your child is hospitalized. Daycare is subsided depending on your income and you of cause have about a year of maternity leave. I feel like this system especially helps out single providers. This system ensures that a mother(or father) can leave an abusive partner knowing that the welfare state will help them with the basics, or should a parent become a widow or widower, there is a safety net that will catch them.

But then there is the phenomenon of voluntary single mothers... AFAIK they receive the same benefits as involuntary single mothers/fathers in my country. In 2018 about 1 in 50 newborn baby was the result of state funded insemination of single women. So its still fairly rare, but its growing, and its a 27% increase since 2011.

I cant help but feel that voluntary single mothers are exploiting a system that wasnt intended for them, usually a middle to upper middle class well educated woman. A system has high support in the population because we all pay into it, but we also receive a lot of benefits or at least we feel secure that the system is there to help us if something bad were to happen. 

But imagine being a single man in this society, he wants kids but has never found the right partner. His female coworker is in a similar situation, but decides to become a single mother. The man will de facto become the co-provide for his coworkers child. He will have to pickup the slack when his coworker gets a day off to take care of her sick child, he's labor and taxes will pay for her maternity leave and her child's education. But he will never get to experience the joy of parenthood and no grandchild will visit him in his old age. He might wonder if single mothers didnt get so much help from the government and labor market, one of them might have decided to start a family with him...

On the other hand I also have a gut feeling that this is a very petty view point. Would the world be a better place if either person never became a parent? Would I want to live in a society where government official would investigate peoples privat lives, in order to decide if they where to receive government help or not? Do I like the idea of women being in any way, coerced into marrying men? Of cause not! But if voluntary single motherhood became much more common, I seriously worry about the social cohesion of the welfare society which I whole heartily support. 

There is this article from the Economist, where they argue that there is a link between polygami and civil war, because this produces so many desperate single men. I feel like this might also apply to this situation:

638,m5siuj,2021-03-15,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Should we work on activism (Political power) or theory (Intellectual power) first?,"I realize that this may be a false dilemma but I am genuinely curious about what all of you think. 

Would it be better for us to focus our energy towards developing theory and a solid knowledge base or organizing and activism? 

It seems like a lot of the criticism of male advocates is that we haven't accomplished much activism wise.

Barring the fact that the people who are leveraging these accusations actively block our attempts to organize, there is some credence with this criticism. 

The problem is that we are often unable to have our movement viewed as legitimate so long as [a certain opposing ideology] has 100 years worth of theory and 40+ years of entrenchment in academia on us. 

They could hypothetically use their influence to disenfranchise us indefinitely since we are not established. 


It feels like a paradoxical problem: 

In order to make real change we need political power. 

In order to get political power we need funds.

In order to get funds we need public support.

In order to get public support we need to be seen as legitimate. 

In order to be seen as legitimate we need intellectual clout. 

In order to have intellectual clout, we need to be a part of academia.

In order to get into academia we at minimum need to develop robust **theory**.

Thus the problem:

In order for our theories to penetrate the academic establishment, we need the amount of political power that can only come from having the level of public support that we are trying to build by getting into academia in the first place. 

I know that in some ways I'm over-simplifying this, so help me if you see the holes in my reasoning. 

How the heck do we go about building the momentum that we need to get real change? Should we focus on building theory in the academies or building protests in the streets?",UnHope20,t2_6n46t2lb,0.91,16,15

640,ffx9ep,2020-03-09,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Psychology today- “why you should hire women over men”,"So [this article came out 2 days ago](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/intentional-insights/202003/why-you-should-hire-women-over-men-according-science?fbclid=IwAR0R_lEr0T4xYS-9YLzr4uh9El2y35q1YM8gsZuQxl3DuhyzpVYaEgmKJ3Y). Literally, advising people to hire women over men.

Firstly, just imagine the reverse- this is purely sexist, it’s teaching people one gender is better than the other with broad generalizations.

Secondly, it’s harmful to men trying to get work, and men are *already* struggling more than women. This makes it even harder

Thirdly, the argument is completely illogical. Quoting from the article:

>What should you do if you’re in a position to influence hiring and promotion? Recognize that, objectively speaking, women at the same career position, work experience, and salary levels as men needed to work harder to get to where they are to overcome the gender discrimination stemming from the halo and horns effects. Thus, female candidates are likely to be substantially better workers than they appear on paper, in comparison to their male counterparts. And especially if you’re a man, you need to give women more credit than you feel they’re due to overcoming horns effect, while decreasing your evaluation of males due to halo effect.

But if you look at stats today, the opposite is true- it’s men who are disadvantaged in hiring, men who are behind in education, and men who are behind in the workforce..

The author goes on to say 

>Consequently — and without any reference to diversity and inclusion initiatives, simply for the sake of your bottom line — you should **always** give preference to women

(Emphasis mine) ALWAYS? So all women are better workers than all men? And businesses should basically just not hire men?


Here’s his last paragraph. It’s pure sexism:

>Seem counterintuitive? Perhaps a little unfair, especially if you’re a male? Well, I’m a man, and I can tell you that I would prefer to hire women over men, and recommend other males do the same. You’re simply doing what’s in the best interests of the organization. In fact, if you work in a publicly-traded company, you are obliged to serve the best interests of the shareholders. That means you need to go out of your way to promote, hire, mentor and include in networks those people who are most likely to serve the best interests of your company. Those people are women, this stands apart from any diversity issues. Doing so will create the biggest profit.",Valacos,t2_5vzsuopm,0.96,77,79

649,k2yqya,2020-11-29,OrdainWomen,How does intercession work in the LDS Church and Mormonism?,"As someone from a Roman Catholic background, pretty much all my spellwork is based on intercession of the Saints and calling upon the Archangels for help with very specific prayers along with used of blessed items using symbolism of angels and saints that have been blessed by priests such as a medal of Saint Archangel Michael or wearing the brown robes worn by Franciscan clergy during rituals or fasting before a ritual to emulate Saint Margaret of Cortona's life before calling for her aid in intercession.

I know as far as Islam goes, the Shia sect believes Saints can intercede directly through prayers asking for their help and Sufi culture has a rich tradition of occultic Islam where you call upon angels and converted Jinn for help.

Additionally in Judaism, I seen the concept of asking the Tzadik for help while praying esp at the graves in some sources and some Jewish prayers involving calling out the Archangels such as the Shema prayer (in this specific example you call the angels to be beside you at a certain direction).

So does this concept exist in the LDS Church? If so, what are Saints called in Mormonism? Does the religion call upon Archangels for magical acts like protection from demons and miraculous healing of diseases and so on? Bonus question, how is Mary seen? In Catholicism she is considered the strongest Saints, so powerful that she is ranked Queen of Heaven in addition to being the Theotokos or Mother of God.

Many have asked for us to weigh in on the controversy regarding Elder Holland speaking at Southern Utah University’s commencement ceremony.

As an organization dedicated to protecting and enhancing the rights of LGBTQ Utahns, Equality Utah disagreed vehemently when Elder Holland deployed the metaphorical use of ‘muskets’ to defend traditional marriage. It was disheartening and painful to hear. Yet, we also understand that the principles of freedom of expression, which are the hallmark of a free and pluralistic society, mean that even those with whom we disagree are entitled to express themselves, especially in an academic setting.

This same principle and First Amendment right has allowed LGBTQ people to make progress in ensuring equal treatment and empathy from our neighbors. Largely for that reason, Equality Utah strongly believes in protecting public forums as a space where ideas can be freely shared.

We are especially sensitive to this issue because there are currently efforts by our opponents to cancel LGBTQ culture. We work diligently to protect the LGBTQ community from ‘Don’t Say Gay’ laws that seek to restrict classroom conversations that allow LGBTQ children and families to talk openly about their lives.

We oppose measures that would ban books from school library shelves when those books discuss or include LGBTQ characters or themes.  

We advocate for the ability of people to march in pride parades and to participate in or attend drag shows, even while our detractors (incorrectly, we believe) suggest that the content of these events are so dangerous that they should be systematically banned.

Certainly as an organization, we have no control over who a university invites to speak. However, as a matter of course, Equality Utah rejects simply shutting down speech we disagree with, especially because we so fundamentally believe in the truth of our ideas. An ever-evolving democracy is better served when there is space to speak, to voice differing opinions, to make mistakes and to have robust debate, rather than drive unpopular messages underground where they risk becoming more rigid and entrenched.

The principles of freedom of expression allow us to live and speak freely.  We must accordingly extend the same courtesy to those with whom we disagree.  We urge those members of our community who are concerned about Elder Holland’s past statements to use our freedom of speech to express why his words were hurtful to LGBTQ Utahns. This is an opportunity to hold his words up to sunlight. But let’s not deploy the same tactics that have been used to silence and intimidate our community.  

Also, as we recognize harmful rhetoric, let’s also acknowledge our progress.

While we disagree with Elder Holland’s past statements, we have also historically been able to find common ground with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Because of their willingness to engage our community, Utah has successfully passed LGBTQ and religious liberty nondiscrimination laws. The Church was instrumental in helping Utah ban LGBTQ conversion therapy for minors, and we are grateful for their willingness to support the Respect for Marriage Act, which now protects civil marriage for LGBTQ couples.

As our friend, Irshad Manji says, it is possible to stand our ground, even as we seek common ground.

For Americans to thrive in a pluralistic society, all have a responsibility to de-escalate the ongoing culture wars, so that all people – regardless of our faith, race, sexual orientation, gender identity or political persuasion – can live and work together with mutual respect.

Whatever the University and students decide to do, our hope is to not silence Elder Holland, but rather to continue to engage in further dialogue with him, to share our lives, hopes, fears and joys. And in so doing, perhaps we end the culture wars and create greater peace and understanding between LDS and LGBTQ Utahns.",Chino_Blanco,t2_38f3q,0.9,7,1

I’m doing a paper of why women are devout members to the LDS church despite being unequal in terms of authority, especially since feminine characteristics like tenderness, love, and self-sacrifice are given more religious value. I would like to hear from both men and women on this. If you’re willing to help a girl out, I’d greatly appreciate it!! :) 

SIDE NOTE: This isn’t meant to be a negative thing. It’s more of an exploratory paper. So please be kind if someone posts something you don’t agree with!

If you don’t feel comfortable posting a comment, you can send me a message :)!",monicayatesLA,t2_58nr6h3,1.0,3,0

The post that first clued me in to how hard LHP rocks:  [#shortcreek4th](http://rationalfaiths.com/shortcreekfourth/)

Lindsay's got a [twitter](https://twitter.com/FemiLinzi)

And even a Mormon Stories [interview](http://mormonstories.org/lindsay-hansen-park-year-of-polygamy/)

And I've noticed a lot of folks raving about [this](http://www.yearofpolygamy.com/) when they rave about LHP.

Not sure where [this new project](http://feministmormonhousewivespodcast.org/new-project-from-lindsay-hansen-park-story-of-woman-podcast/) is at, but maybe we'll get an update.

I've probably missed a whole bunch of cool stuff that LHP has been up to... feel free to upbraid me by providing links to further examples of her awesomeness.

But save your questions for the 15th.
