39,zfc65,2012-09-06,politics,Equal Pay for Equal work. What it really means for workers. ,"Last night at the DNC convention they had a woman stand up and talk about equal pay for equal work, her battle for it, how republicans blocked the law and how supposedly woman make 77 cents to a mans dollar and that the goverment needs to force equal pay. 

First let me state it is already illegal to pay someone less based on religion, sex, race or disability but the burden of proof is on the employee. This law had the potential to shift this burden onto the employer and allowed a woman to bring the lawsuit up at anytime even after being fired. these are the reasons the republicans said they blocked the law. 

More importantly we now need to break down the issue and what it really means. 

First and foremost in many union jobs, lower skilled jobs and contractible obligations i do believe equal pay for equal work should be enforced because these jobs are paid by the length of the time you have been employed and education. Usually not the merit of your work. 

But.. 

The stat woman make less then men at 77 cents is false. It compares every man in the work  force to every woman without considering average hours worked, education, type of jobs (example a nurse to a doctor). It is closer to 5 cents. 
http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2012/05/03/gender-pay-gap

This though still ignores a couple important figures. 

1)Men are more likely to negotiate their starting salary. 

2) Men are less likely to leave the work force to raise a family (Though this is changing)

3) Societal pressures push woman to certain jobs. For example more men are in labor intensive jobs, pilots and doctors. More woman are teachers, nurses and in child care. 

This pretty much debunks the statement men are paid more then woman.  (again were discussing merit based pay, not time based) 

Now this is the issue with pushing this issue into merit based salary. It cannot have a good outcome. One of two things will happen, wages will stagnate due to lack of negotiating ability as companies cannot pay people more for negotiating which will see a lowering of salaries overall. Or companies will just hirer less woman because they become a liability, especially into the crucial entree level positions which are more likely over time to see raises and promotions due to merit. 

Most likely you will just see woman pushed out of high paying merit based jobs. This is similar to happened to people with disabilities and minorities (in our current time not civil rights era). By turning these people into liabilities you create a large disincentive for companies to higher them in higher paying merit jobs. This is due to the fact that merit based pay in skilled jobs is more subjective based on your negotiating skills, ability to show the value you add and aggressiveness.

We have to understand that companies will rarely pay you more then you ask. This is why you will just find less of these high paying jobs for women because the company does not want to lose the best men in their work force due to lowering pay (Remember were global competitors now) and risk the lawsuits. This means they will just hire woman in the time based jobs rather then the merit. 

And companies will be less likely to hire woman into the intro level positions (what most people need in order to work up the ranks and gain valuable experience) because, if they turn out to be worse then their male counter parts and make less/ get less promotions then they now have the ability to sue. which not only cost the company money but hurts their reputation even if the accusations turn out to be false.

This tends to be my issue with big goverment. The intention is good, but big goverment people tend to not realize the real consequences which is often the opposite effect of what they were looking for. 

The true answer here is not to force equality but to promote it through teaching everyone about negotiating, how to appraise your value and what kind  of education you really need. But this isnt a good catch phrase and its hard to do. 

**TLDR: Punish real pay discrimination where is occurs, in non merit based jobs that pay based on your time with the company. But look at the real statistical reasons why woman are paid less, like negotiating skills, hours on average worked and job types. Rather then force companies to pay equally which will just discourage them from hiring woman in the higher paying merit based jobs, hurt long term negotiating skills and stop companies from hiring woman into important entree level merit positions. Promote getting the right kind of education, promote negotiating skills and societies image of what jobs are normal for woman to do.**

42,41atnm,2016-01-16,politics,Why I support Bernie Sanders and oppose Hillary Clinton,"**Here are the reasons that I support Bernie:**

Bernie wants to overhaul our corrupt political system.  Representatives and Senators are bought by corporate donors. Bernie wants to repeal the *Citizens United* Supreme Court decision that allows unlimited donations into campaign-supporting Super PACs and move instead into public funding of campaigns so that anyone can run for office.

Bernie wants to regulate corrupt corporations.  Corporations often pay no taxes either by qualifying for tax breaks for ""good behavior"" or by moving their profits overseas to tax havens, move jobs overseas to low paying countries and lobby Congress while paying into campaign-supporting Super PACs as a result of *Citizens United*. Bernie wants to close the corporate tax loopholes, raise corporate taxes and compel corporations to bring jobs back to the country by repealing free trade agreements that currently allow corporations to send jobs overseas.

Bernie wants to regulate our corrupt banking system.  Banks can gamble with money in risky investments and still come back to the Federal Reserve to bail them out. Bernie wants to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act which keeps banks from performing both commercial and investment services and break up the ""too big to fail"" banking institutions that grew so large that they required bailout in order to save the economy.

Bernie wants to regulate a corrupt Wall Street.  Powerful brokers gamble with the stock market by making thousands of micro-transactions an hour that increase speculative risk. Bernie wants to put a tax on these micro-transactions to put towards free public college education.

Bernie wants to regulate our corrupt law enforcement and judicial system.  People are being put in jail for marijuana possession and police are disproportionately targeting non-white people, especially black people. Bernie wants to make the police accountable for unjustifiable asset seizure, brutality and homicide, de-schedule marijuana from the federal illegal narcotics list and abolish the death penalty as cruel and unusual punishment.

Bernie wants to improve the quality of life for struggling poor and low-income Americans.  The middle class is shrinking as a result of diminishing wages, expensive healthcare and education, too little family time and too little savings for retirement. Bernie wants to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, expand Medicare to all citizens, make public college tuition free, give three months paid maternal and paternal leave and lift the cap on Social Security so that wealthier people pay more into it than they currently do. The increased wages will also help the economy grow when more people have disposable income.

Bernie wants to give opportunities to struggling poor and low-income Americans.  The middle class needs work and this country needs an infrastructure overhaul. Bernie wants to add infrastructure rebuilding programs to fix up our roads, bridges, public transit and water systems, creating millions of jobs in the process for the middle class and getting this country back in good shape.

Bernie has been a passionate spokesman for the poor and middle class [since he was a mayor](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/bernie-sanders-mayor/407413/), to the point that [his mayoral exploits are still written about today](https://www.thenation.com/article/bernies-burlington-city-sustainable-future/) and since he began his [tenure in Congress.](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/inside-the-horror-show-that-is-congress-20050825)  Bernie [shouts himself hoarse advocating for the needs of the poor and middle class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxRCnwqUrc8), and I love him like my own grandfather for his dedication to the issues that matter in this country.

**Why I oppose Hillary Clinton:**

Hillary says that war should be the last resort, but voted for the second Iraq War and as Secretary of State pushed for NATO to bomb Libya, then gloated about the killing of an old, powerless former dictator. Now she supports a no-fly zone over Syria which could lead to a standoff with Russia.

Hillary says she'll take on the big banks but supported a bill that would reduce Chapter 7 protections for poor people with credit card debt and receives millions in speaking fees and donations from JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley employees yet acts like she doesn't owe them favors.

Hillary used to support single-payer healthcare as FLOTUS, even supporting Bernie in his fight for the same. However, Hillary now opposes it, using disingenuous attacks against Bernie to cast down his single-payer plan.  These attacks also suspiciously coincide with Hillary's receipt of donations from the health insurance industry, which has a lot to lose from single-payer healthcare.

Hillary says she wants to overturn *Citizens United*, but she herself has a Super PAC.

Hillary says she supports net neutrality but she's received million dollar donations into that Super PAC from pro-SOPA Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg.

Hillary supports an encryption ""back door"" to allow government access to our mobile devices in order to catch terrorists and she wants tech companies to cooperate with her to grant access to our mobile devices.

Hillary has campaign staffers that have previously been paid through the very suspicious Clinton Foundation, which receives massive donations from foreign countries with atrocious human rights records.

Hillary says that she supports gay rights but bluntly told Chris Matthews ""no"" when asked about gay marriage rights, supported DOMA and categorized marriage as ""a sacred bond between a man and a woman"" before the Senate.  Hillary is now making gay rights a large part of her campaign, but is clearly lying for votes.

Hillary says she's going to enact criminal justice reform to keep kids out of jail but she opposes marijuana reform, supports the death penalty and supported a tough anti-crime bill by saying that it would target young criminals who were remorseless ""super predators"".

Hillary plays dirty on the campaign trail.  In addition to her attacks on Obama in 2008, she is now attacking Bernie by calling him a [sexist](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/hillary_clinton_is_smearing_bernie_sanders_as_a_sexist_it_s_an_insult_to.html), a [racist](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/hillary_clinton_keeps_smearing_bernie_sanders_as_a_sexist_now_she_is_reaching.html) and an [advocate for the gun lobby](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/01/11/hillary-clinton-is-smacking-around-bernie-sanders-on-guns-heres-why/) and [claimed that he will repeal Obamacare without replacing it with superior single-payer Medicare for all](http://www.salon.com/2016/01/14/hillary_clintons_absurd_bernie_smear_why_attacking_him_from_the_right_on_healthcare_makes_literally_no_sense_at_all/).

I don't trust Hillary and I never will.  I think she might have been a worthy candidate, before she changed to take money from very wealthy interests while pretending to support the poor and middle class.  I think Hillary's efforts to present herself otherwise are beginning to fail.  I think she is lashing out in ways that make her seem increasingly spiteful and desperate.  I think Hillary's gender is becoming less relevant to informed feminist voters, and I think gay and non-white voters are beginning to see through the political history of the Clinton family for its harmful effects on gay and non-white Americans.

In my estimation, the only candidate running who can put us past the mistakes of the neo-liberal Clinton administration and the disastrous neo-con Bush administration is Bernie Sanders.

I hope this was somewhat worth reading.",Toppdeck,t2_imnpn,0.6,43,82
43,3iw9u4,2015-08-29,politics,The differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.,"There are probably hundreds of comments a week about how the parties are both the same, but is that true? It's often said that the parties are ""the same"" when it comes to Wallstreet and money in politics the parties but the actual data paints a very different picture.

46,45looy,2016-02-13,politics,"Is a vote for Hillary a vote for the country, a vote for women or a vote for a woman?","Gender issues are a continuously growing topic. While strides have been made to equalize rights between men and women, clearly the averages over gender do not equal. This is seen most prevalently in the [average income gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_pay_gap) (not a wage gap), the [suicide gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_suicide), the [workplace fatality gap](http://www.bls.gov/iif/oshcfoi1.htm), the [education gap](http://www.theguardian.com/education/educationsgendergap), the [workplace authority gap](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/Published%20writing/CC-C9.pdf
) (PDF), the [sentencing gap](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/11/men-women-prison-sentence-length-gender-gap_n_1874742.html), etc.

The explanation for these gaps is explained in a highly ideological manner. Feminist groups argue that all gaps are due to residual patriarchal structures in our society - whether the gap favours men or women, men are the ones in power and thus patriarchal pressures are responsible for the gaps. Men's Rights groups argue that the gaps are a complex interaction of individual choices that, while they may be influenced by social pressures, need to be the responsibility of the individual barring any evidence of collusive pressures. Instances of gender discrimination are abhorrent and should be prosecuted, but we should not take away the agency and responsibility of individuals in choosing the outcome of their lives.

This is a central issue in the upcoming DNC Primaries, and potentially in the presidential election that follows. Unless you are hiding under a rock, you are aware that Hillary Clinton is facing off versus Bernie Sanders. Gender is quite clearly a central issue in Hillary's campaign:

- [Hillary used her gender as evidence that she is not part of the 'establishment'](http://time.com/4208917/hillary-clinton-establishment/), a clear indicator that she views the 'establishment' as a male structure.

- [Gloria Steinem, a central figure in feminist circles, has outright stated that the feminist choice for the election is Hillary Clinton](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/19/gloria-steinem-hillary-clinton-white-house). Since feminism is a theory about gender relations, this clearly indicates that gender is a central part of the support for Hillary.

- [Hillary has campaigned on a gender platform at various functions.](http://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2015/10/23/hillary-clinton-plays-the-gender-card)

So, the question becomes, as the title says, is a vote for Hillary a vote for the country, a vote for women or a vote for a woman?

**A vote for the country** would indicate that Hillary's stated ideas and plans are superior, and the future she promotes in her political advocacy is the best for the country. Hillary is supported by the DNC, and thus represents the party (rather than the people), so you could argue that this could be worded as ""A vote for the party"".

**A vote for women** would indicate that voting for Hillary would be because of the unique nature of her as a woman - that a female president would necessarily empower women, and that her decision making process is non-male, which may be the desired quality.

**A vote for a woman** would indicate that voting for Hillary is simply a vote for the individual, and her gender is irrelevant in the matter. People believe that she would be a good president, acting in the best interest of the entire country in all that she does.

I am not trying to imply a false trichotomy here. These are not mutually exclusive motivation. Yet for an individual who supports Hillary, one may be more prominent than the others, and for an individual who does not support Hillary, one may be perceived as more prominent than the others. Actuality and perception are both important.

Yes, I understand that Reddit has a wide support for Bernie Sanders. But he isn't meant to be the focus of this discussion. The focus is meant to be around why people support Hillary - as an individual, or as a representative of her gender, or as a representative of her party (which clearly support her over Bernie). More importantly, I am hoping to instigate discussion over whether it is appropriate to select someone for a 0.000001% job based on gender (which alludes to the CEO gap - should a person be selected because of their gender or because of their qualifications).

Of particular note, I am not trying to bash Hillary Clinton. In fact, I am not focusing on her negatives at all. This isn't about who is voting against her, this is about who is voting for her and the public perception of those who are voting for her.

Obviously some people will note that I am a moderator of /r/MensRights, which may attract some ire. I am including that in this self post explicitly to show that I am not trying to hide any ideological leanings. I personally believe that people are supporting Hillary because of her gender regardless of her policies. My own views are that this would be damaging to the US and to women in general, because it suggests that she wouldn't be electable if she weren't female. This is demeaning both to men and to women, and, in my view, is the exact opposite of the female empowerment that many of her supporters think it is. It reinforces the idea of 'You don't have to listen to me because I am right, you have to listen to me because of my genitalia.'",sillymod,t2_9ari6,0.41,0,7

With these Sources in mind, it doesn't take a lot of imagination and reasoning to come to the conclusion that Obama and Romney do not agree with the **facts** of the current economic situation.

But let's break this down farther. Many of you suggest that we should have or currently have a democracy but to put it simply, we [don't](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7M-7LkvcVw) . What we're dealing with today will be written down in history books for generations to learn from. What do you know about the [Federal Reserve](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWKlz2Z4Nlo) ? Do you know how [Libor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLVzBNgcVFE) affects you or  even how [money](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99DYh8Zpkpw&feature=related) is created? 

Before you vote, learn the facts. 

Let's look at Obama's record:

[NDAA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2r1JSR8EC8)

[Drone Stikes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQrM4cWzVqw)

[Obama's Truth Squad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltrzP9YeaEw)

And these are only a few. But Obama isn't the only one who is dirty here, Romney has a clearly muddied past as well:

I'm left with a question that annoys the shit out of me. With over 300 million people in the United States, is this really the best we could come up with? Are these really the type of people we want to vote into office to run this country?

52,z5418,2012-08-31,politics,A mother's pro-Romney rebuttal to many of r/politics' arguments,"Hello all.  I've been having friendly political email debates with my mom lately, with many of my arguments coming from links from this sub (although I have only lurked until now), and I'm interested in hearing r/politics' thoughts on her latest response.  She works for a small company that is heavily invested in the economics related to the healthcare industry, and she thinks Obama is causing a huge negative effect on the economy.  I know many people here (me included) lean towards the idea that a lot of the economic issues we are currently facing in the US is caused by the GOP and that Romney will only make it worse.  Her rebuttal here comes from a different perspective than what is seen a lot on this sub, and I'd love to hear all of your thoughts on it.  The text:

>I am up to date, thanks, you know we live and breath politics in my office.  We have two liberals, mostly conservatives, and me as the independent.  One of the liberals just switched to Romney for business reasons. I read every page of the Tribune (liberal), New York Times political opinion (liberal), WSJ (conservative) and I watch lamestream media as well as Fox. You are only spouting talking points and mainstream media, which is 85% liberal.
 
>Most of what Factcheck said about Ryan is not correct and has already been rebutted.  Ryan never said that Obama closed that plant, he said Obama made a speech at that plant saying that the plant with intervention would stay open, and it didn't.  He made the speech as a candidate, not as president, and you can hear the whole thing.  Ryan's point was that government intervention doesn't always help.
 
>The point about Medicare is also wrong - Obama does divert from Medicare at the expense of old people, and in a different way than Ryan's plan.  Fact check says that is wrong because he 'only' reduces payment to nursing homes and hospitals, not beneficiaries - ridiculous response, Medicare NEVER pays beneficiaries directly, it only pays vendors like my nursing homes.  The diversion definitely hurts old people to divert cash to Obamacare, which adds 30 million young Medicaid people, and here in Illinois Medicaid is not paying its current obligations - they are 6 months behind.  You really must look at the details.  Ryan does divert money from the current Medicare system, but it is to change people like me (under 55)  to more of a voucher system because Medicare is scheduled to be out of money in 2024. That's different from vastly expanding entitlements to young Medicaid recipients, which is simply unaffordable.  They need to first sharply reduce government spending, drop healthcare costs by increasing competition and implementing tort reform.  Adding 30 million people to Medicaid sounds lovely, but they can't pay for what they have, and the deficit needs addressing. We spend as much on interest as we do on Medicaid, it is unsustainable.
 
>Also I don't think it's hypocritical at all to accept stimulus money for your state even if you voted against it.  That's like me not taking a tax deduction I don't approve of (like home mortgage interest).  Of course I'm going to take it if it's the law, my not taking it won't change the law.  Fact check is just wrong about that, the stimulus was for the most part a huge waste of money; some of the project worked locally but it just didn't help enough for the money, Ryan is correct. Fact check's opinion is that makes Ryan wrong about the stimulus because he asked for things for his state - I don't agree.
 
>And don't even get me started on Obamacare.  Since I work in Medicare and Medicaid, I know all about it.  It is a disaster and should be repealed.  You won't find a person who actually works in this industry who likes it, it hurts business, doesn't reduce costs, and helps 30 million people at the expense of 84 million.  The best way to help the uninsured is to drop costs and get them jobs with benefits. The states had already state-wise done some of the popular measures, like adding kids, but they shouldn't be forced on a federal level and neither should the mandate, which is of course a tax no matter what you call it.
 
>There are more lists of Obama errors, I just don't have time to research them right now. Also most of your list is just opinions with no backup, and some are not opinions I agree with - for example, Romney saying that Obama wants to lead us to a European style wealth distribution country is true - that is what socialized medicine and taxing the rich is all about.  Obama is on record saying - in his voice and in context - that he favors more distribution of wealth, that he thinks America is better off when we 'share the wealth' etc. It's not the government's job to redistribute in a capitalistic society. The trouble is that the top percentages pay most of the federal income tax now, and 47% pay zero federal income tax.  Also unsustainable. We have the highest corporate income tax in the world, and it is an internet rumor that corporations do not pay it.  They pay vast amounts of tax, and taxing the wealthy like my owners taxes all the small businesses that are on their Schedule C's.  Not good for the economy, and it just encourages companies (like Aon which just moved to London) to leave here and incorporate elsewhere.  Tax increases in history have always been contractionary to the overall income to the treasury.  Spending cuts are the only thing that will help the deficit, which Obama inherited some of and made MUCH worse.
 
>I am a social liberal and financial conservative.  I like some of what Obama has done, and I approve of gay marriage, but financially for business he is a disaster. He is also a disaster for defense. I am not as pro-choice as you seem to think either, I think there are way too many gender based and 'convenience' abortions. It's not just the woman's body in question, even though I am not religious there is another life there at some point - abortion should be legal but rare, as Bill Clinton said. I was a single parent and my child turned out just fine (although somewhat argumentative).
 
>I think Romney is a working man with business experience, and business will grow under him. I don't like a lot of things about him either, but he's the lesser of two evils. I want business and manufacturing to grow, and I want government to shrink. I do not want defense cut, I think we should have the strongest defense in the world and continue to.
 
>Nobody's perfect, but there's no third party that can win.  I voted for Clinton - twice.  But I can't vote for someone who is hurting big business and corporations as much as Obama is.  Wish there was someone better out there.""




It's long and not overly detailed, but it touches on a lot of things that are getting debated around here lately so I'd love to hear any agreements or rebuttals you guys have to offer!",Lovelace42,t2_8uu3j,0.38,0,12
53,l2doe,2011-10-06,politics,Schiff responds to Occupy Wallstreet Demands,"Transcribed from [Peter Schiff's Radio show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=LE67awbdK6o#t=1364s)

*Demand one: Restoration of the living wage. This demand can only be met by ending ""Freetrade"" by re-imposing trade tariffs on all imported goods entering the American market to level the playing field for domestic family farming and domestic manufacturing as most nations that are dumping cheap products onto the American market have radical wage and environmental regulation advantages. Another policy that must be instituted is raise the minimum wage to twenty dollars an hr.*

Schiff Response:  ""Twenty dollars an hour?!  How many jobs are going to be destroyed if you force employers to pay everybody 20 dollars an hour plus benefits and taxes?  What would happen to the price of consumer goods in this country if not only did we not allow imports to come in, but we forced American companies to overpay their workers?""

*Demand two: Institute a universal single payer healthcare system. To do this all private insurers must be banned from the healthcare market as their only effect on the health of patients is to take money away from doctors, nurses and hospitals preventing them from doing their jobs and hand that money to wall st. investors.*

Schiff Response:  ""Where's the government going to get all of this money to provide all of this insurance?""

*Demand three: Guaranteed living wage income regardless of employment.*

Schiff Response:  ""In other words, they want everybody in America to having a living wage even if they don't have a job.  Well if you can get a living wage, which I guess is $20 an hour, and not work, well why would somebody want to have to work to get the $20 an hour?  They want the entire country on welfare.""

*Demand four: Free college education.*

""Where's the government going to get the money?  Who are they going to tax?  They just wiped out all of the jobs with the $20 minimum wage and they put everybody else on welfare.  Where's the money going to come from for free education?""

*Demand five: Begin a fast track process to bring the fossil fuel economy to an end while at the same bringing the alternative energy economy up to energy demand.*

Schiff Response:  ""No more fossil fuels?  How are we going to get around?  'By bringing in alternative energy.'  I mean come on, they're going to destroy our standard of living?  We can't use gas?""

*Demand six: One trillion dollars in infrastructure (Water, Sewer, Rail, Roads and Bridges and Electrical Grid) spending now.*

Schiff Response:  ""Where's the government going to get that money?  Remember, they just destroyed all the jobs with the $20 an hour minimum wage.  They just destroyed the economy with protective trade barriers.""

*Demand seven: One trillion dollars in ecological restoration planting forests, reestablishing wetlands and the natural flow of river systems and decommissioning of all of America's nuclear power plants.*

Schiff Response: ""Decommissioning all of our nuclear power plants?  We've already got rid of all the fossil fuels?  Now we can't have any nuclear power?  We're all going to live off of solar?  These guys are so far up in the stratosphere.""

*Demand eight: Racial and gender equal rights amendment.*

Schiff Response:  ""Don't they have already have equal rights?  We need another amendment?  They throw that in, they're throwing in some red meat for the left.""

*Demand eleven: Immediate across the board debt forgiveness for all. Debt forgiveness of sovereign debt, commercial loans, home mortgages, home equity loans, credit card debt, student loans and personal loans now! All debt must be stricken from the ""Books."" World Bank Loans to all Nations, Bank to Bank Debt and all Bonds and Margin Call Debt in the stock market including all Derivatives or Credit Default Swaps, all 65 trillion dollars of them must also be stricken from the ""Books."" And I don't mean debt that is in default, I mean all debt on the entire planet period.*

Schiff Response:  ""Then they wipe out all assets.  Every bank is insolvent, all the insurance companies are broke, all the pensions are broke.  They're going to wipe out everybody.  If you say nobody has to pay back their debt, then you say nobody gets to collect on their assets - there's no more money...  all the old people that have all retired are going to have to come back and find jobs, but how are they going to get jobs especially when the minimum wage is $20 an hour.  The one thing that is going to happen if we follow their advice, the $20 minimum wage won't matter because the dollar will have absolutely no value, because the government is going to give away free health care to everybody, free employment, free education, the government is going to take care of the entire country, but they're going to have no one to tax, because they destroyed the entire economy and wiped out all of the capital.  Business will have no money to invest anymore because all of their savings and investments were wiped out because the government cleaned out the debt.  This basically, what these kids want, is the complete destruction of the U.S. economy.

This is how people think.  This is the product of the American education system - we've churned out a bunch of socialist morons who have no clue on how an economy works.  They probably have less clue than 7 year old kids.  Think about it - 'The government is going to give everybody money, the government is going to take care of everybody, going to provide insurance for everybody, supply the jobs for everbody....'  In other words, this is a communist revolution that Michael Moore is applauding - these are their demands.  Is this any different than Castro's Cuba or Mao in China or in Russia?  No, it's the same nonsense.  What is creating the climate in which this kind of non-sense can flourish and gain an incredible audience?  It's the environment that was created by the very thing they're advocating - by big government, by central planning, by central banking, by the government that is trying to micro-manage the tax code and regulations in the U.S. economy.  Instead of allowing the free-market economy to lift all boats, the government is sinking all the boats.""",phernoree,t2_3cwqi,0.35,0,3
54,l62rb,2011-10-09,politics,A point for point critique of the official Occupy Wall St. statement.  ,"*They have taken our houses through an illegal foreclosure process, despite not having the original mortgage.*

This happened to ONE guy, it's not indicative of how banks typically work, it's a straw man argument.  

*They have perpetuated inequality and discrimination in the workplace based on age, the color of one’s skin, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation.*

Having worked for a big corporation in the 90's, I can assure you that corporations are terrified of even the hint of racial or sexual harassment suits.  I personally witnessed 50 people's careers be ended due to receiving, (note not sending) an email that was considered to be sexual harassment.  An entire department of this company was dismissed because the corporation was afraid that if it didn't fire them, a harassment lawsuit would be brought against them.  I'm all for creating a pleasant workplace for people of all stripes, but it has gone overboard, we don't need to make employers so afraid of lawsuits that every word is examined and scrutinized by lawyers.  

*They have poisoned the food supply through negligence, and undermined the farming system through monopolization.*

This is hyperbole, has zilch to do with the economy, and is a waste of political capital.  

*They have profited off of the torture, confinement, and cruel treatment of countless nonhuman animals, and actively hide these practices.*

Again, this just distracts from legitimate complaints about Wall Street, and perpetuates the idea that the people protesting are hippies who have no clue.  


*They have continuously sought to strip employees of the right to negotiate for better pay and safer working conditions.*

Good point, this is on topic and is the kind of thing that will bring more people to the cause.  

*They have held students hostage with tens of thousands of dollars of debt on education, which is itself a human right.*

People aren't forced to get student loans, they sign a document promising to pay X amount in X years.  They give their word that they will do this.  To go back after the fact and say they're slaves to their promise, that somehow this is unfair, is nonsense.  If you don't want to take out a loan, don't sign the paperwork.  If you want a free education, work hard and get a scholarship.  Don't expect the world to bail you out of a poor decision.  

*They have consistently outsourced labor and used that outsourcing as leverage to cut workers’ healthcare and pay.*

It's unclear how outsourcing creates leverage to cut worker's healthcare.  Although I agree that outsourcing negatively affects the wages of U.S. workers, people should be free to hire the workers they choose to.  If someone in China is the best choice for an employer to hire, it's not the government's place to force them to hire an American to do the job.  

*They have influenced the courts to achieve the same rights as people, with none of the culpability or responsibility.*

This is exactly the sort of thing the protest should emphasize.  The corporate veil that protects the illegal actions of corporate agents should be dismantled, if by one's actions they commit a crime they should be held liable.  

*They have spent millions of dollars on legal teams that look for ways to get them out of contracts in regards to health insurance.*

My only critique of this is that it's worded poorly.  I, along with many thousands of others, have been victim to insurance companies attempting to avoid payments for doctor and hospital bills that ought to be covered by the insurance agreements.  It is often more expensive to sue an insurance company than it would be to outright pay a bill that they refuse to pay.  I've noticed that this happens MUCH less often now that Obamacare is in effect, and he/democrats should be lauded for their efforts to reign in the systemic corporate abuse that had been going on previous to Obamacare.  

*They have sold our privacy as a commodity.*

It doesn't have a significant affect on the economy and is a distraction to the goals of the movement.  

*They have used the military and police force to prevent freedom of the press.*

Edit the military part out.  

*They have deliberately declined to recall faulty products endangering lives in pursuit of profit.*

Stay focused.  We already have a system in place to fix this problem, corporations can be sued when they have defective products.  Stick to messages that have a broad appeal and are not currently addressed by our system.  

*They determine economic policy, despite the catastrophic failures their policies have produced and continue to produce.*

I agree, but you need to put in a suggestion of how to remedy this problem, rather than just highlight the problem itself.  For instance, you might suggest greater regulation of lobbyists.  

*They have donated large sums of money to politicians supposed to be regulating them.*

SPOT ON.  

*They continue to block alternate forms of energy to keep us dependent on oil.*

Unless you highlight individual examples of corporations buying up alternative energy technologies and preventing them from coming to market, you'll have a hard time convincing the average American that there's a conspiracy.  If there is a workable alternative to oil that actually costs less than oil, cite it.  

*They continue to block generic forms of medicine that could save people’s lives in order to protect investments that have already turned a substantive profit.*

Agreed. 

*They have purposely covered up oil spills, accidents, faulty bookkeeping, and inactive ingredients in pursuit of profit.*  

When you give ""inactive ingredients"" the same emphasis as ""faulty bookkeeping"" it leads people to think they have the same importance.  Eliminate everything besides the bookkeeping and change it to ""accounting scandals""

*They purposefully keep people misinformed and fearful through their control of the media.*  

The subtext of this is that people are too ignorant to educate themselves.  Nobody likes to be patronized.  

*They have accepted private contracts to murder prisoners even when presented with serious doubts about their guilt.*

If you have a problem with a jury verdict, or a judge's actions, address that.  Calling the death penalty a ""contract to murder"" is a bit ridiculous.  

*They have perpetuated colonialism at home and abroad.*

Cite the war, cite the cost, cite the lives lost.  Calling U.S. foreign policy colonialism is disingenuous, given that if we so chose, we could essentially conquer the planet.  

*They have participated in the torture and murder of innocent civilians overseas.*

It's Occupy Wall Street, remember? 

*They continue to create weapons of mass destruction in order to receive government contracts.*

More hippie nonsense, if you are going to blame defense companies for creating weapons, you might as well blame birds for flying.  Change the leadership of government if you want reduced defense budgets, not Wall St.  

All of the above being said, I want the movement to succeed, I just think the recent press release was garbage.  ",self_yelp,t2_5dtq2,0.55,3,16
55,492k81,2016-03-05,politics,Why this is the most important election of our lifetime,"Hell if I know where I should be posting this, so this is probably as good as anywhere else. If you think I'm simplifying things and leaving out details, it's because I'm keeping this as short as possible. Want the TL;DR? Check out the bolded headings.

**This is the most important election of our lifetime because of climate change**

I'm a researcher in this field. The science has been settled for decades, but you don't need to look to scientists for the proof. If you're still a skeptic, look at how the oil and gas companies are making plans to gather resources from a warmer arctic, or how military and intelligence organizations are planning for social and political upheaval. *Climate change is happening, and it's happening now.*

We need to make meaningful changes to mitigate the effects of climate change immediately. At risk are our food and water security. Our infrastructure. Our economy and environment. If we keep the status quo, we're screwed in a couple decades. If we make incremental changes, we buy ourselves another couple years. *We need to make meaningful changes now.*

**Climate change is directly related to income inequality**

Climate change is exacerbated because those with money and access take actions that delay meaningful changes or expedite resource extraction. If we address the corruption and bribery and imbalance that lead to income inequality, we have a chance at addressing climate change.

**Income inequality is the issue that should bind us together as Americans**

For Trump supporters, polls show that you're upset about trade agreements like TPP. These trade agreements are lobbied for, and often written by, those with money and access. If we address the corruption and bribery and imbalance that lead to income inequality, we have a chance to make trade agreements that benefit middle-class Americans.

For Hillary supporters, polls show that you're upset about the lack of progress in gender, racial, and LGBT issues. Social progress is stymied by numerous factors, including the lack of official policies to support working families and the scapegoating of minorities to economically-disadvantaged whites. If we address the corruption and bribery and imbalance that lead to income inequality, we have a chance to reshape our social contracts.

For Bernie supporters, we need to start having conversations about why income inequality is the most important issue, about how it's tied to everything else we care about. People across the political spectrum are disgusted with the system, and we need to find common ground on the root causes of our discontent; namely, income inequality and a political class that does not represent us.

**Our politicians want us to focus on our differences, the solutions require that we focus on our shared values**

Democrats and Republicans benefit when we're divided. They want us to argue about whether we're pro-abortion or pro-life, rather than talking honestly about how to reduce the number of mothers considering abortions. They want us to argue about whether we're for or against affirmative action, rather than discussing how to improve educational and career opportunities. They want us to argue about whether we want lower taxes or more government services, rather than agreeing that we should get something of value for the taxes we already pay.

What's the result? There's no correlation between the values of the middle class and the policies our representatives enact. *It's good news when our politicians cannot agree and our government is broken; it's bad news when our politicians agree and implement policies that hurt us.*

**Bernie Sanders is the first viable candidate in my lifetime that might facilitate real change**

We've been able to vote for opportunistic politicians, who see which way the wind is blowing before making decisions. We've been able to vote for divisive politicians, who play up differences and stereotypes to engage their supporters. We've been able to vote for lukewarm moderates, who lend their support to the largest donors. And they all find lucrative jobs as lobbyists after they leave office.

Bernie Sanders is going to tell you exactly what he thinks and he's going to do exactly what he says. Sure, I may not agree with him all the time, but *I'd rather trust my well-being to an honest person with the best intentions, than a dishonest person with the best ambitions.* He'll use the presidency to highlight the problems in our political system, call out the bullshit in both parties, fight for meaningful changes at a national level, and shift the conversation to support grassroots movements.

**Vote for Bernie because it's the best chance we have**

There's no way to know whether any of the candidates will be able to facilitate changes in our society, or whether these changes are even possible given entrenched interests and societal inertia. If this were any other election, we could just roll the dice with any of these candidates and, even if things went poorly, it would turn out fine in the long run. Remember, ""the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice"", and all that.

But, again, this is not a standard election. Climate change needs to be addressed immediately, or there is no long-run to speak of.

Look at their records. Based on previous actions, anyone running as a Republican is going to roll back efforts to address climate change. Based on previous actions, Hillary is going to take one step forward and ten steps back. Bernie is our only chance to elect someone who will fight to ensure we have a future for our children and grandchildren... and for ourselves.",as_the_world_berns,t2_vhqsl,0.54,5,23

57,3ajdgm,2015-06-20,politics,Three Reasons Why It's Old People's Fault Millennials Don't #VoteLocal,"Last week the Knight Foundation released a [scathing report](http://users/robertsingleton/Downloads/KnightFoundation_Millennium_Voters.pdf) on the record low participation of millennials in local government. Why don't millennials participate in local elections or care all that much about local issues? They don't know anything about them. And, as a millennial who works four separate jobs that are all related to local politics, I am going to be very blunt about this: it's not their fault. It's the fault of the previous generations. But don't worry old people, my criticisms may be harsh, but I assure you they will be constructive.

Here are the three core reasons, in my eyes, why millennials lack any knowledge or experience with local government and politics, and thus don't feel comfortable enough to participate:

* Lack of Civic Education
* Local Government has a Fundamental Audience Problem
* Justified Cynicism is Misplaced (only because of the first two problems)

**Lack of Civic Education**

This one is actually pretty straight forward: millennials don't know anything about local government because no one ever taught them about it. Think about it, when you were growing up in school you were taught math and english, some history, physical education, maybe some arts if you were lucky, and yes, government. But what did you actually study? The federal government. You learned that George Washington and his band of freedom loving rebels fought off the evil British crown and created the greatest system of government ever known, as governed by the Constitution and Bill of Rights. But what about community governance? Did you learn what a general plan is? Or how about what zoning is? Of course you didn't. Neither did we.

I even studied politics and law in college, but never covered local politics. In fact the only reason why I even understand how a planning commission works is because I also studied environmental studies, and we had to research land use issues and permitting. Yet that governs how every single thing is built and operated in every single community!!!!!! It's an absolutely fundamental concept to understanding the world around us, and it doesn't even get a footnote is most curriculums.

How is it then in any way surprising that most millennials don't feel comfortable voting on these types of issues? If I don't know where my water comes from than what makes you think I would feel comfortable saying yes or no on a hundred million dollar water/sewer bond. What's worse, if I don't understand how public financing for capital improvement projects works, I am probably not inclined to support *anything.*

Here's the good news, the solution to this problem is as straight forward as the problem itself. Mandate that local civics courses be incorporated into K-12 education. Education leaders seem to have no problem changing the common core standards every five years for the past two decades anyway.

**Local Government has a Fundamental Audience Problem**

Now this one transcends age, because local government has a hard time reaching anyone with its archaic and ineffective forms of community information sharing and outreach, but the problem is compounded when dealing with those of a younger generation, mainly due to information sources. I will spare you most of the glaring details as this topic has already been covered at length by many different people, most of whom are much more experienced and articulate than I, but the gist of it is that the way government currently communicates with its citizens is opaque and severely outdated.

Probably the best encapsulation of this failure is explained in a [TED talk by Dave Meslin](http://www.ted.com/talks/dave_meslin_the_antidote_to_apathy?language=en), who contrasts how government usually offers a call to action versus that of a private sector company. The example he uses is to compare a public notice of a new development (see below) to that of an advertisement for buying shoes. One has a clear call to action, is accompanied by a picture of what it is proposing, and clearly communicates to the audience how it can engage further. [This is anything but what I just described.](https://civinomics.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/biz-board-public-hearing-notice-9252014-1-638.jpg)

And don't even get me started on having to navigate through various 1990s style websites to find a sideways photocopied site plan saved as a static PDF... Because I can go all day!!!!

But let's talk about use of media and how that factors into civic participation. To illustrate this concept I will start with an example many of you are probably intimately familiar with. I live in Santa Cruz, which can definitely be considered a college town. Every year when students graduate or move away for the summer you will find our otherwise lovely city streets boasting a plethora of old furniture and mattresses, left by students who frankly have no idea what else to do with them. Every year I hear people complain about this problem, but not once have I ever witnessed the city attempt to reach out to these students in a way that might actually get to them.

For instance, I know that the city gives out special tags every year that I can use to get a free ""bulky item pickup"" from our trash collection service. I know this because I received them in my water bill, alongside a tacky newsletter that resembles a cheap coupon booklet. But let's say I am student, who, chances are, lives in near absolute squalor with many other people. I probably don't pay my own water bill, and am likely to have never seen or heard of this program. Is that my fault?

Now at this point some of you are probably asking about my supposed ""constructive"" criticism, and don't worry, it's coming. But I really want to drive this point home a bit more: *if you want to give us information, use the channels that we actually use to receive it.* 

[Countless studies](http://www.mediainsight.org/PDFs/Millennials/Millennials%20Report%20FINAL.pdf) have already demonstrated that young people don't read the local paper (have any young people besides me ever done this?). So use what we use: Social media, email, advertise at places and events we frequent, etc; really, this isn't that hard. Hell, I can buy a Facebook ad this second, target it by age, gender, location, and interests, and reach 6,000 people for less than $75.00!!!!

[Contrast this with the most recent post made by the City on their Facebook page.](https://civinomics.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-15-at-7-09-06-pm.png)

**Justified Cynicism is Misplaced (only because of the first two problems)**

This last one is a bit more complex, because it involves feelings of trust and some political assumptions, but bear with me. The last major reason that millennials don't participate locally is because we don't distinguish between local government and the federal government. To many of us, it's just the all encompassing ""government"". This stems from our lack of civic education and the audience problem. And, in case you haven't noticed, government as a concept is not winning many popularity contests right now. In fact most most people would rather [eat dinner with a family of cockroaches than a member of Congress.](http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/01/congress-less-popular-than-cockroaches-traffic-jams.html)

Yes millennials did show up to vote in record numbers in 2008 to elect Obama because, frankly, he inspired us to believe that government could change from what it was perceived as. Seven years later, and regardless of who you blame, not much has happened to change that original perception. And consider this, in our lifetime the cost of higher education has quadrupled, the cost of living has risen substantially while real earnings have either stagnated or declined, no government action has been taken to address climate change (despite an overwhelming majority of millennials believing this to be a core issue), and we have slogged through a financial crisis that has left most of us either chronically under employed or not employed at all.

To put this in context, I was at a political campaigning event yesterday that featured Joe Smitian, a local Supervisor from Palo Alto, as a panelist. Joe, bless his heart, said something I will never forget. ""If people are going to trust you as a candidate, and government as a whole, you absolutely need to be able to answer one fundamental question: How has their government improved their life?""

He continued, ""if you cannot answer that question then you have no business running for office."" Now I am paraphrasing a bit, but the core message here is pretty obvious: most millennials can't answer this question. It is because of our lack of civic education, and the government's inability to communicate, that our justified mistrust of what the federal government has (and hasn't) done, that makes it so difficult for so many of us to care.

58,9jqed,2009-09-12,politics,Hey /r/politics:  I need your help with a little local debate forum I've been having in my town,"Mostly, I'm just too lazy to compose my arguments, and I know there are people on here much more passionate than I.  SO!  Here is the text posted by the anti-health care package, show me how well Reddit debates!


The argument against health care:

You want to punish insurance companies? Make them compete.
Whenever two businessmen meet, ""the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.""
That's why we need a third, fourth and 45th competing insurance company that will undercut them by offering better service at a lower price.
Tiny little France and Germany have more competition among health insurers than the U.S. does right now. Amazingly, both of these socialist countries have less state regulation of health insurance than we do, and you can buy health insurance across regional lines -- unlike in the U.S., where a federal law allows states to ban interstate commerce in health insurance.
Government-provided health care isn't a competitor; it's a monopoly product paid for by the taxpayer. Consumers may be able to ""choose"" whether they take the service -- at least at first -- but every single one of us will be forced to buy it, under penalty of prison for tax evasion. It's like a new cable plan with a ""yes"" box, but no ""no"" box. 

""A man lost his health coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because the insurance company discovered that he had gallstones, which he hadn't known about when he applied for his policy. Because his treatment was delayed, he died.""
Assuming this is true, in a free market, such an insurance company couldn't stay in business. Other insurance companies would scream from the rooftops about their competitor's shoddy business practices, and customers would leave in droves.
If that insurance company weren't required by law to cover early childhood development programs and sex-change operations, it wouldn't be forced to cut corners in the few areas not regulated by the government, such as cancer treatments for patients with gallstones.

The only reason most ""pre-existing"" conditions aren't already covered is because of government regulations that shrink the insurance market to a microscopic size, which leads to fewer options in health insurance and a lot more uninsured people than would exist in a free market.

Apparently, promising to cut costs by having a panel of Washington bureaucrats (for short, ""The Death Panel"") deny medical treatment wasn't a popular idea with most Americans. So they started claiming that they are going to cover an additional 47 million uninsured Americans and cut costs ... without ever denying a single medical treatment!
Also on the agenda is a delicious all-you-can-eat chocolate cake that will actually help you lose weight!
Everything that does not exist in infinite supply is rationed.
Under national health care, you'll have no choice about how to ration your own health care. If your neighbor isn't entitled to a hip replacement, then neither are you. At least that's how the plan was explained by our surgeon general. 

The last time it was decided an industry was so important that the government needed to step in and contain costs was when they set their sights on the oil industry. In both the U.S. and Canada -- presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter and Canadian P.M. Pierre Trudeau -- imposed price controls on oil.
As night leads to day, price controls led to reduced oil production, which led to oil shortages, skyrocketing prices for gasoline, rationing schemes and long angry lines at gas stations.
You may recall this era as ""the Carter years.""
Then, Ronald Reagan became president and immediately deregulated oil prices. The magic of the free market -- aka the ""profit motive"" -- produced surges in oil exploration and development, causing prices to plummet. Prices collapsed and remained low for the next 20 years, helping to fuel the greatest economic expansion in our nation's history.
You may recall this era as ""the Reagan years.""
Freedom not only allows you to make your own rationing choices, but also produces vastly more products and services at cheap prices, so less rationing is necessary. 

Despite being a thousand pages long, the health care bills passing through Congress are strikingly nonspecific. (Also, in a thousand pages, they weren't able to squeeze in one paragraph on tort reform. Perhaps they were trying to save paper.)
These are Trojan Horse bills. Of course, they don't include the words ""abortion,"" ""death panels"" or ""three-year waits for hip-replacement surgery.""
That proves nothing -- the bills set up unaccountable, unelected federal commissions to fill in the horrible details. Notably, the it was rejected an amendment to the bill that would specifically deny coverage for abortions.
After the bill is passed, the Federal Health Commission will find that abortion is covered, pro-lifers will sue, and a court will say it's within the regulatory authority of the health commission to require coverage for abortions.
Then we'll watch a parade of senators and congressmen indignantly announcing, ""Well, I'm pro-life, and if I had had any idea this bill would cover abortions, I never would have voted for it!"" 

Both Medicare and Bernie Madoff's investment portfolio are bankrupt because they operate on a similar financial model known as a ""Ponzi scheme."" These always seem to run fabulously well -- until the money runs out.
Not only is Medicare bankrupt, but it is extremely limited in whom and what it covers. If Medicare were a private insurer, it would be illegal in many states for failing to cover hearing aids, podiatry, acupuncture, chiropractic care, marriage counseling, aromatherapy and gender reassignment surgery.
National health care will eliminate everything outside of Medicare, which is the only thing that allows Medicare to exist. 

Technically, what Obama said is that the bill isn't ""designed"" to give health insurance to illegal aliens. (That bill, the ""Health Insurance for Illegal Aliens Act of 2009,"" was still being drafted by Ted Kennedy at the time of his death, may he rest in peace.)
But unless the various government bureaucracies dispensing health care are specifically required by law to ask about citizenship status, illegals will be covered. We can't even get employers and police to inquire about citizenship status, but congress assures us that doctors will?
And by the way -- as with the abortion exclusion -- they expressly rejected amendments that would have required proof of residency status to receive national health care.
On July 30 of this year, a House committee voted against a Republican amendment offered by Rep. Nathan Deal that would have required health care providers to use the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program to prevent illegal aliens from receiving government health care services. All Republicans and five Democrats voted for it, but 29 Democrats voted against it, killing the amendment. 

Politicians never, ever drop a heinous idea; they just change the name. ""Abortion"" becomes ""choice,"" ""communist"" becomes ""progressive,"" ""communist dictatorship"" becomes ""people's democratic republic"".
It doesn't matter if they start calling national health care a ""chocolate chip puppy"" or ""ice cream sunset"" -- if the government is subsidizing it, then the government calls the shots. And the moment the government gets its hands on the controls, it will be establishing death panels, forcing taxpayers to pay for abortions and illegal aliens, rationing care and then demanding yet more government control when partial government control creates a mess. 

Federal tax incentives have created a world in which the vast majority of people get health insurance through their employers.
Then to really screw ordinary Americans, the tax code actually punishes people who don't get their health insurance through an employer by denying individuals the tax deduction for health insurance that their employers get.
If congress really wanted people to be able to purchase health insurance when they move or lose a job as easily as they purchase car insurance and home insurance (or haircuts, dog walkers, cars, food, computers), they could do it in a one-page bill lifting the government controls and allowing interstate commerce in health insurance. This is known as ""allowing the free market to operate."" 

The ""public option"" trigger - Why does the government get to decide when the ""trigger"" has been met, allowing it to do something terrible to us? Either the government is better at providing goods and services or the free market is -- and I believe the historical record is clear on that.
Why not have a ""trigger"" allowing people to buy medical insurance on the free market when a trigger is met, such as consumers deciding their health insurance is too expensive? Or how about a trigger allowing us to buy health insurance from Utah-based
insurers -- but only when triggered by our own states requiring all insurance companies to cover marriage counseling, drug rehab and shrinks?

61,134yvsg,2023-05-01,MensRights,The 'gender pay gap' is a myth. It should be called the 'gender earnings gap'.,"The so-called ‘gender pay gap’ is one of the central tenets of feminist doctrine. Of course, in one sense, it is a fact. Estimates vary, but on average, women will earn about 75-85% of what men earn over their lifetimes. We might more accurately refer to this as a gender earnings gap than a gender pay gap, but whatever you call it, I won’t argue. It seems pretty clear to me, and I don’t doubt the statistics. The question is whether or not it matters. If one can reasonably extrapolate from those figures that women earn less than men purely because of workplace discrimination, then that’s an issue. But the correlation between gender and lifetime earnings is nowhere near as simple a picture as feminists make out.

The idea most frequently conflated with the gender earnings gap is that of unequal pay. The notion that women are paid less than men for doing the same work is often—implicitly or explicitly—touted as the reason women earn less. But paying one gender less than the other for the same job is illegal, and it has been for over fifty years. Indeed, if it were possible to pay women less than men for the same work, one would expect businesses to reduce their labour costs by employing more women. But that’s the opposite of what happens. 

On average, even the women who work 'full time' work far fewer hours than men, and this is just one of the many reasons they may earn less over a lifetime. They also choose different careers from men, are less likely to do dangerous jobs or relocate for a higher salary, and tend to prioritise other things, like children and family. None of this has anything to do with the relative amounts men and women might be paid for doing the same work. The difference between equal pay and the gender pay gap is important and seems straightforward enough, but the deliberate conflation of the two concepts is ongoing, and many feminists are desperate to keep it alive.

Take the Fawcett Society’s ‘Equal Pay Day’. This is described as “a national campaign led by Fawcett Society in the UK. It marks the day where women effectively on average, stop earning relative to men because of the gender pay gap.” In the US, the Whitehouse itself is in on the act, which it does to highlight “how far into a new year a woman must work, on average, to earn what a man did in the previous year.” In 2023, it was March 14th. The justification for this is that “women working full-time, year-round are paid an average 84 cents for every dollar paid to men.” 

The implication is that throughout the workforce, and with consistent and predictable regularity, employers are breaking the law by paying women 84% of what they pay men for the same work. But is that really what’s happening? How could such a flagrant disregard for employment legislation be taking place on such an enormous scale, and all through the relatively quantifiable, traceable conduits of taxable salary payments? The answer is that it’s not. Women are not being paid 84% of what men get paid for the same work. They can’t be, because they’re not doing the same work. 

Amongst the top female-dominated jobs in the US and the UK are nursing, childcare, and secretarial work; amongst the top male-dominated jobs are construction, plumbing, and vehicle maintenance. In the US, the annual mean wage for all occupations is $58,260. Out of the top ten female-dominated professions, all but three pay an annual mean wage which is lower than that, and the annual mean wage for the top ten female-dominated professions combined ($50,581) is almost ten thousand dollars lower than the national mean. On the other hand, five of the top ten male-dominated fields pay higher than the overall mean, and the average for the top ten male-dominated jobs comes in at $59,643, or in other words, $1,383 higher than the overall average.

The average annual pay in the UK is £31,285. Again, only three of the top ten female-dominated professions pay more than that, compared to five of the top ten male-dominated professions. The top ten female-dominated professions in the UK pay an average of £26,925 for 35 hours of work; the top ten male-dominated professions pay an average of £30,451 for 48 hours of work. The Fawcett Society takes care not to highlight facts like this on Equal Pay Day, but it’s worth noting that in the UK, not only are men working longer hours, they are actually getting paid a *lower* average hourly rate than their female counterparts.

So what does all that tell us? Men and women pick their careers with some predictability along gender lines. Men work longer hours and get paid more overall, although their hourly rates aren’t always better. They also do some of the more dirty, dangerous jobs that women don’t like. Similarly, women tend to do things men don’t like. These jobs often require fewer working hours and offer more flexibility. That’s hardly a fashionable thing to say, and I am by no means advocating for adherence to traditional gender roles, but the statistics reflect a freely exercised choice, and remain true whether you like them or not. 

This element of choice is crucial when discussing the gender earnings gap with any nuance. Another key element is age. When you bring age into the equation, you realise how much of a blunt instrument those much-touted ‘gender pay gap’ statistics are. Longitudinal studies tracking the trajectories of professional men’s and women’s careers over time have shown a negligible earnings gap for the first ten years after university. Around ten years in—which coincides with the time most graduates start having families—a divergence between average male and female earnings starts to set in. Feminists waste no time in concluding that this is due to sexism. But could it be that women at that stage in their careers just have different priorities in life?

In a recent Yale study of management-track employees from a large retail chain, researchers lamented the failure of higher-ups to promote female employees. In their abstract, the study's authors rush to conclude that this is due to hiring managers' inability to recognise women's leadership potential. Yet the researchers also found that female employees were less likely to accept promotions when they were offered, citing longer hours, less flexible working patterns, and potential relocation as barriers to acceptance. Indeed, when isolating promotions requiring relocation, the ‘gender promotion gap’ was significantly more pronounced. The researchers’ data also showed that men were more likely to leave the firm to look for promotion elsewhere if they were passed over internally. In other words, more men than women were prepared to secure a higher salary by committing to work longer hours, enjoy less flexibility, and undergo the upheaval of leaving the company or moving home. 

It may reasonably be deduced that not only do women tend to choose different careers from men, but they may also exercise greater freedom of choice when navigating those careers. Should work and family issue competing claims for their attention, they at least have the option of picking between the two. The element of female choice is often missing from the gender earnings gap debate, presumably because it might make the gap look like a good thing for women.

Another frequently absent point of discussion is the financial pressure upon men starting a family. Whilst it is perfectly obvious why a new mother might want to work less, it is equally logical, although less commonly talked about, that a new father might feel he needs to work *more*. The financial anxiety that comes with children can be terrifying for men, not least in a society where high-earning careers are touted as a birth right attendant upon ‘male privilege’. However, when men do pursue advancements in seniority and salary, their actions are often attributed to an ugly desire for power and domination. 

Yet the average man is not an individual economic entity; he exists as part of a household structure which commonly includes a woman, and she benefits as much as he does from any advancements in his career. This particular elephant in the room is often ignored, but cohabiting heterosexual couples are the norm, particularly amongst those who have children. As such, the amount of money a woman earns and the amount she can access are not the same. The average married woman is hardly likely to oppose her husband seeking a pay rise so he can provide for their children. In doing so, rather than embodying the stereotypically selfish, domineering corporate pig, he may be seeking greater financial reward out of a sense of responsibility, duty, and love. And it so happens that the time this becomes most pressing for him is the time that many women are pulling back from their careers. It will be an unpalatably congenial thing for a feminist to admit, but when viewed this way, the divergence in male and female earnings after a decade of work seems to be less about female subjugation than it is about female choice, male sacrifice, and familial cooperation.",AntifeministWisdom,t2_9hdlhwt2k,0.94,490,99
62,14p55pz,2023-07-03,MensRights,"Debunking the ""Gender Pay Gap""","Copied from the [original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TraditionalMuslims/comments/14p3dwq/debunking_the_gender_pay_gap/).

So I didn't think I needed to debunk this as it's been done a million times before. However, it's come to my attention that apparently some still believe it. So, just to have an easy-to-reference, codified treatise on the issue, I'm writing this piece to utterly decimate this commonly propagated liberal trope.

Mainstream media presents [articles like this](https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-wage-pay-gap-charts-2017-3) that claim there is a pay gap between men and women, and that it's on the sole basis of gender. While it is true that men tend to earn more money than women, it is absolutely false that it's due to gender bias in favor of men (if anything, it's actually in favor of women). The problem with the statistics shown is that they only take into account median yearly salaries without accounting for any other confounding variables that may be skewing the data. For example, if I told you that the more people drown the more often ice cream is sold, would you take that to mean that ice cream causes people to drown? No, you'd probably say that it's because of ice cream sales increasing in the summer when it's hot, which is simultaneously when people go swimming more, thereby increasing the likelihood of drownings to happen; this shared commonality (i.e. the heat) is a confounding variable.

For the so-called ""gender pay gap"", here are the confounding variables:

1. This statistic does not account for what types of jobs are being worked, as **men choose higher-paying jobs**.
   * [*Source 1.*](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.1120.0757) *Demonstrates how women choose different jobs than men because they value and/or prioritize different things than men (e.g. better work-life balance). Because of this, the jobs they prefer tend to be lower-paying.*
   * [*Source 2.*](https://academic.oup.com/oep/article-abstract/57/3/479/2361925?redirectedFrom=fulltext) *Same as Source 1, but also found that ""job satisfaction of men increases with additional earnings while that of women does not"" (p. 486).*
   * [*Source 3.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719) *Landmark study; displays evidence that men choose higher-paying jobs. The more egalitarian/feminist a country is, the fewer women choose careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (i.e. traditionally male-dominated roles). Giving greater career choice to women increases (apparent) gender disparities within the workforce.*
   * [*Source 4.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2525981) *Cited over 11,600 times. Demonstrated very directly that women choose jobs that are lower-paying, and that women are NOT being paid less to do equal work; and this was in 1973, almost 50 years ago. Please note that any discrimination found thereafter is really just residual unaccounted variability rather than actual discrimination per se, as detailed in the conclusion.*
   * [*Source 5.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243210361475) *So ignoring the ideological bullshit that's indirectly being pushed, it demonstrates clearly that women choose different jobs than men and that it is solely due to their own choice; and that the only time women don't choose traditionally female jobs over male jobs is when they're essentially forced to take the male job.*
      * *Interestingly enough, this supports the findings of* [*this study here*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719) *(which was a MASSIVE, catastrophic blow to the ""men and women are equal but female oppression and gender discrimination are the only reason why we aren't"" narrative); the researchers found that the more egalitarian/feministic a society is, the greater the gender differences will be (regarding what people will choose to pursue). In other words, when you give women free choice to pursue whatever they want, they will willfully choose occupations/education/life goals that will only increase the gender gap between men and women.*
2. The statistic does not account for **different positions within a respective field** (e.g. head/lead developer vs senior developer vs junior developer; they're all developers, but different rankings/positions). We know this because it's not possible to know the relative rankings/positions of people's careers if they don't even know what those careers are in the first place.
   * [*Source 6.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1808858) *Looked at a company from the years 1966 and 1969-1971; found no gender discrimination when accounting for all variables. States that at most, there may be gender discrimination with regards to promotion, but even this is speculative as it is not explained why this may be the case (and truth be told, we already know why this is; I will explain later on). If the concept of a gender wage gap was already being debunked/disproved back then, it definitely doesn't exist now (at least, not in favor of men anyway...).*
   * [*Source 7.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30038574) *Studies a company that was sued for ACTUALLY discriminating against women with regards to promotion, and found that there wasn't any pay differences between men and women who were given the same job/assignment. In other words, even when discriminating against women, they were still being fair about the pay.*
3. The statistic does not account for **age** (e.g. a young person may make more money than an older person in a physically-taxing field, older people in fields that would require more knowledge/wisdom to handle, etc.).
   * [*Source 8.*](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26623) *Generally speaking, workers over age 40 are only about half as likely to get a job offer as younger workers if employers know their age*
4. The statistic does not account for **job tenure** (i.e. how long someone has been working for their respective employer for).
   * [*Source 9.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122413514584) *Shows men in general have greater job tenure than women. It's decreasing overall (particularly for men) but there are various reasons for it, many of which are oftentimes advantageous from a career/monetary standpoint, which men are going to be more receptive towards since men typically prioritize money more than other aspects of a career (see Source 1).*
   * [*Source 10.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831432) *It's in the title; job tenure typically entails higher wages. In recent times, this has been changing within certain fields (hence why it's been decreasing as shown in Source 8 above), but the point still stands overall.*
5. **Men work more than women**, which implicates in the previous 2 points with men being able to develop greater job tenure and work experience. More men work full-time than women. Moreover, the term 'full-time"" means anyone working 35 hours or more (with some lowering it to 30 hours or more to further skew the stats in favor of their social agenda); this could mean anywhere from 35 hours to 135 hours per week, and I can tell you right now that the vast majority of people who are working an exorbitantly high number of hours are men, NOT women.
   * [*Source 11.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2015/time-spent-working-by-full-and-part-time-status-gender-and-location-in-2014.htm) *Statistics from the US government. Men simply work more than women, even when comparing men who work full-time to women who work full-time, and men who work part-time to women who work part-time.*
   * [*Source 12.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2019/pdf/home.pdf) *More statistics from the US government for 2019.*
      * *""Among full-time workers, those usually working at a job 35 hours or more per week, men are more likely than women to work more than 40 hours per week. In 2019, 25 percent of men who usually work full time worked 41 or more hours per week, compared with 14 percent of women. Women were more likely than men to work 35 to 39 hours per week: 10 percent of women worked such hours in 2019, while 4 percent of men did"" (p. 8).*
      * *Women were more likely to be working a part-time job than men.*
      * *""Women who worked part time made up 23 percent of all female wage and salary workers in 2019. In comparison, 11 percent of men in wage and salary jobs worked part time.""*
   * [*Source 13.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2020/pdf/home.pdf) *Even more statistics from the US government for 2020.*
      * *19.6% of men working full-time worked 41 or more hours per week, compared to only 10.2% of women who were working full-time. This means that men working full-time were nearly twice as likely as women to work 41 hours per work or more (Table 5). This coincides with* [data discussed at the 2019 G20 Summit](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---cabinet/documents/publication/wcms_713376.pdf)*.*
      * *Men working full-time were also 2.3 times more likely than women to work 60+ hour weeks: 4.3% of men worked 60 hours per week or more compared to only 1.9% of women.*
      * *Women working full-time were more than twice as likely as men to work shorter workweeks of 35 to 39 hours per week: 7.7% of full-time women worked those hours, compared to only 3.6% of men who did so.*
      * *Men working 35-39 hours per week earned only 92.4% of what women earned working those same hours ($600 median weekly earnings for men vs. $649 for women). This means there was a 7.6% gender earnings gap in favor of female workers (for that cohort), and this is BEFORE accounting for any confounding variables!!!*
      * *Women were more likely to be working a part-time job than men.*
      * *Although not reported by the BLS, it can be estimated using its data that the average workweek for full-time workers (in 2020) was 41.3 hours for women and 42.8 hours for men, meaning the average man employed full-time worked 1.5 more hours per week compared to the average woman. This adds up to men, on average, having worked an additional 78 hours per year compared to the average full-time female worker.*
      * *Some of the raw earnings gap naturally disappears by simply controlling for some of the variables. For example, women technically earned 82.3% of median male earnings for all workers working 35+ hours per week (i.e. full-time). But for those workers with a 40-hour workweek (more than three-quarters of all full-time female workers), women earned 87.4% of median male earnings, and that's after accounting for just one variable: hours worked.*
      * *For young, full-time workers aged 16-24, women earned 94.7% of the median earnings of their male counterparts. Once again, controlling for just a single important variable—age—we find that more than two-thirds of the ""gender pay gap"" disappears. There are tons of other factors like these that go unaccounted for when you hear people/the media talk about the gender pay gap. Keep this in mind from now on.*
   * [*Source 14.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2008/02/art5full.pdf) *Conducted by the US government. Looks at 12 European nations and shows that men work more than women in all of the countries studied, among many other things.*
   * [*Source 15.*](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t04.htm) *Government statistics for 2021. Men clearly work more than women.*
   * [*Source 16.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00197939211045376) *Some people may not think that men work more than women enough to help warrant the pay gap, but this paper explains otherwise (they basically accounted for the jobs being worked and how men and women vary in the number of hours worked within these specific jobs rather than ignoring the types of jobs worked).*
6. Building off the previous point, **men work more overtime**, and the gender pay gap statistic does not account for overtime pay. And if men are working more hours than women, that means that men are going to make more money from overtime which is higher than your standard base rate.
   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *This is one of my favorite studies ever. It's just so well-done and is, in my opinion, the epitome of what research is supposed to look like. It was conducted by Harvard University, and one of the authors is literally a woman (meaning there isn't any bias caused by sexism or misogyny on behalf of the authors). It demonstrates a multitude of things, but as it relates to this specific point, it shows clearly that men work more overtime than women (p. 2–3; Figure A.16, p. 85).*
7. **Men are more likely to accept overtime, and especially when presented without prior notice** (e.g. if someone had an emergency and couldn't come in, and employees are asked if they can stay, men are more likely to accept it). This means men tend to be more reliable workers overall. It's technically a separate point from the one above because the frequency of accepting overtime is different from actually working it (e.g. someone could work a lot of overtime one week and not work it at all for the next 12 weeks, vs someone who works only a few hours of overtime every week).
   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *Also shows how men are more likely to accept overtime when it's presented to them and that men in general are especially more likely to accept overtime without prior notice (p. 3; Figure 6, p. 49; Figure A.17, p. 86).*
8. **Men are less likely to have unexcused absences.**
   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *Women have more unexcused leave of absences than men (Figure 22, p. 65). This further implicates men as being more reliable workers. What's ironic is that men face harsher penalties/disciplinary measures than women (Figure 21, p. 64), contrary to popular belief.*
9. The statistic does not account for **work experience** (i.e. how long someone has been working in their respective field).
   * [*Source 18.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2535309) *In general, men have greater work experience than women (courtesy of working more than women); the timing of work experience and overall work matters a lot as well, and since men are simply working more than women, the advantages of this timing will be more apparent in men than women. This study has data directly showing that men have greater actual work experience, potential work experience, and job tenure than women (the last of which relates back to the previous numbered point).*
10. **Men do not get pregnant and are less likely to leave work for kids** (e.g. paternity leave); pregnancy forces women to stop working, which relates back to points 4, 5, 8, and 9, and men being less likely to leave work for kids also shows more dedication to work.
      * [*Source 19.*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwao.12506) *The abstract alone states ""mothers with young children have reduced their work hours four to five times more than fathers"". Some of you may say that this therefore nullifies Source 12 as supporting evidence for point 5, but it actually strengthens it because it exemplifies the gender differences that can cause a skew in the gender wage gap myth and highlights the behavioral dimorphism between the sexes. At most, it would only nullify SOME of its generalizability on a year-to-year basis, but even then, it still showcases how statistics can be skewed/misrepresented to provide a false narrative about gender discrimination that doesn't actually exist with regards to pay. Anyway, Source 13 also states similar as well due to the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) where women are far more likely to leave work/not come in, but I don't want to be redundant and keep using the same source even though it's a fantastic study.*
11. **Men are less likely to take sick days.**
      * [*Source 20.*](https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/68/5/320/4973626) *Women take more sick leave than men, even after accounting for many variables.*
      * [*Source 21.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6070205/) *The introduction alone is enough to show that women take more sick leave than men, this is undisputed and has been for decades. This study sought to determine whether there were differences in attitudes towards sick leave based on gender, and whether this contributes to women's absenteeism. They did not find much support for this, indicating that women take more sick leave regardless of societal norms and expectations.*
      * [*Source 22.*](https://journals.lww.com/joem/Abstract/2015/08000/High_Job_Demands,_Job_Strain,_and_Iso_Strain_Are.5.aspx) *Women take more sick leave due to mental health reasons than men (p. 860), with 90% of ""mental health"" reasons being either stress, mood, and/or anxiety-related.*
12. **Men are less likely to take vacation days.**
      * [*Source 23.*](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1019.5400&rep=rep1&type=pdf) *Great study that shows how women take more vacation days than men, while also discussing why it is the case. Has several other findings/key points that showcase male-female dimorphism as it relates to work and the family, and they are very interesting; they essentially prove what is already self-evident with regards to gender roles, despite what mainstream society is trying to push today.*
13. **Men are more likely to move for a job.**
      * [*Source 24.*](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol40/53/40-53.pdf) *Shows conclusively that men are more willing to move for a job. They try to say that single women are just as likely as single men to move for a job after accounting for confounding variables, but that's nonsense because one of the variables was essentially how well they like the job (i.e. ""job characteristics""), when the location of a job doesn't have an impact on how much the job itself should or should not be liked (and if any of you researchers disagree, you will need to account for the Halo Effect to fully make sure that distance isn't what's making them view those same ""job characteristics"" as distasteful enough for them to not want to move). It's as if they're trying to say that jobs should cater to women by changing how they operate so women will like them better, rather than simply just acknowledge that women do not want to move for work as much as men. In fact, it's not even as if they're saying that, they literally suggest it lmao! It's very gynocentric when you look at it. The reason why they say this is because they do not want to admit that the gender gap is literally caused by women's own personal preferences, because then that would mean that the gender gap is normal, natural, and that women willfully make the choices that cause the gender gap, essentially nullifying any narrative that women are victims of oppression and that the gender differences that exist between men and women are caused by men and women ACTUALLY being different. This last point really irks the ideologues. In addition, it would place accountability over the gender gap on women, and women absolutely cannot handle having accountability.*
      * [*Source 25.*](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/app/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/GD_ResearchReport_MetroMovers_Draft4-1.pdf) *Literally the same thing as the previous source (including all of the progressive diatribes that I dismantled) but with a massive online job search website.*
      * [*Source 26.*](https://web.stanford.edu/~niederle/CEN_discrimination.pdf) *This one has some progressivism within it as well, but ignoring that, we find that any discrimination against women isn't due to them on the sole basis of them being women, but rather because of beliefs over how well they would do the job. In fact, it shows that people are MORE likely to favor women as job candidates when a negative belief is ascribed to a woman rather than when it is ascribed without the gender being stated. In other words, gender discrimination isn't gender discrimination at all but rather performance discrimination, which is the definition of a meritocracy (i.e. a system in which people are judged based on their merit/how good they are at their job, rather than characteristics unrelated to said job/merit).*
14. **Men are more likely to work night shifts.**
      * [*Source 26.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2021/article/nonstandard-work-schedules-in-29-european-countries-2005-15-differences-by-education-gender-and-parental-status.htm) *Government study looking at data across 29 European nations from 2005-2015. It shows that in every region, save for Scandinavia, men are more likely than women to work hours outside the standard 9-5. This coincides with data from Source 14 and Source 17, which showed similar findings.*
      * [*Source 27.*](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3216/3084) *Shows definitively that men are more likely to work night shifts than women.*
15. **Men are more likely to work weekends.**
      * [*Source 27.*](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3216/3084) *Also shows that men are more likely to work weekends than women.*
      * [*Source 28.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2011/07/art1full.pdf) *While also showing that men are more likely to work nonstandard work shifts, it also shows that men are more likely to work weekends as well, which Source 11, Source 14, Source 15, and Source 17 also demonstrated.*
16. **Men are more likely to work holidays.**
      * *Yet again, this was already shown by Source 11, Source 14, and Source 15.*
17. **Men are far more likely to work dangerous jobs** such as oil riggers, underwater welders, etc. These male-dominated jobs pay higher than nurses and hair stylists on the basis of danger, hence why it's separate from the first point.
      * [*Source 29.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4880472/) *Men are more likely to work dangerous jobs and are simply more willing to accept risks that jobs may have in general. This is represented by the fact that men make up most workplace deaths.*
         * [*Source 30.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfoi2004_chart11.pdf) *US government data for 2004; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (93%) of workplace deaths.*

18. **Men are more interested in jobs that are scalable**; men are more interested in physical things, while women are more interested in jobs that deal with people. The former is scalable, the latter is not; that means Elon Musk is able to service millions of people with Tesla whereas Mrs. Johnson is only able to teach a class of 30 students per year. This point is separate from the first point because scalability relates to potential growth/earning, and based on the laws of chance, you're more likely to find some major hit successes in professions that are scalable rather than unscalable.

This also acts as evidence for the very first point about men choosing higher-paying jobs.*

      * [*Source 46.*](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1994) *Women are only as likely as men to ask for a raise when they are explicitly told they can negotiate for one.

      * [*Source 47.*](https://escholarship.org/content/qt9978v172/qt9978v172.pdf?t=omys3w) *Women are less comfortable engaging in salary negotiations, they're less likely to negotiate salaries overall, and they're not as good at it as men (the researchers don't word this last point this way because it angers feminists, but that's the gist of it). There are many other reasons that they go into as well.*
20. **Men are typically more aggressive/competitive in their mindset and attitudes regarding work** which helps them climb the corporate ladder more (e.g. you make more off commission in sales because you close more sales due to being more competitive).

Why not just admit that women are not as willing to hyperfocus on their careers in the same way as men? Why not just admit that women don't do it because they simply don't want to sacrifice other areas of their life for a career? Why not just finally admit that women are different from men? They can't. And that's a problem for BOTH genders.*
21. **The top people are always going to be men due to the variability hypothesis.**
      * [*Source 49.*](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/493921) *Men vary greater than women; when seeing any of the extremes, men are more likely to be represented on both ends. That means the most successful people in the world are going to overwhelmingly be men, and the most unsuccessful dregs of society will also be men. This represents a problem with feminist thinking because they want ""equality"" when it comes to powerful, important, and successful positions in society and say that a lack thereof in these top positions are due to sexism and discrimination (and that therefore all of men and society need to just give women these positions to ""make it fair""), but they will never talk about the men at the lowest ends of society or talk about equalizing that. I'm not saying they should become homeless criminals and whatnot either (rather they should focus on decreasing the amount of men that are disenfranchised here; but they'll never do that since they would have to admit that men aren't oppressors and would have to actually acknowledge the plights of men), I'm just saying there's a double standard here whereby women want the rights and privileges of both sexes with the responsibilities of neither, all the while blaming men for any (and all) of their own shortcomings and faults.*
      * [*Source 50.*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886913003036) *Men vary more than women yet also tend to be better on average on measures of creativity.*

Just to really drive home the point, I quote the official statement of the US Department of Labor after having a massive [study](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2019/pdf/home.pdf) conducted for them:

>**This study leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a multitude of factors and that the raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action. Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers.**

And even ignoring the technical research aspects, just think about it like this: If a woman were to do the same job as a man for less pay, only women would get hired because that would be CHEAP LABOR. And for those who don't know, there's a whole sexism argument that claims men get hired more easily than men (which also isn't necessarily true either, but that's a separate discussion).

There isn't a single statistician who isn't braindead, let alone competent, who takes the statistics presented about the gender pay gap myth at face value when drawing conclusions. It's only after you account for all the variables available can you really begin to extrapolate true causality, and even then it is still weak with these types of statistical analyses anyway since it's virtually impossible to account for every variable that exists *and* have a full consensus for data rather than a statistic that has a much smaller sample size. Plus, when it comes to statistical analyses like this, you're ultimately seeing how things relate to one another (i.e. correlated) rather than seeing how they directly influence/cause something. The only way to truly test for causality is by running actual experiments with strong controls in place (which is nigh on impossible to do in situations like these). If you take a statistics class or two, you'll learn about this stuff more in-depth. Multivariate analyses are pretty much always better than univariate ones (when drawing final conclusions from, anyway), and it's due to reasons like this where society perpetuates the gender pay gap myth as a social dogma.

If women can do anything men can do (and ""do it better""), then why are they still supposedly ""oppressed""? Why are they still the victims? And why do they need government legislation to mandate ""gender equality"" in order to achieve it? If they were really the same as men (i.e. ""equal"") in all these regards, wouldn't perfect equality naturally occur based on merit alone? It doesn't make sense, and it's simply because it's just not true. Men and women aren't the same, and we won't ever be the same. That doesn't mean we shouldn't be treated fairly—equity over equality, always—but this myth needs to die once and for all.

So I agree that some male dominated lines of work women get snuffed out of but how can anyone possibly protest about pay inequality just because for example, 90 percent of doctors are men in hospitals and doctors get paid more than nurses so that automatically means that women are being treated unfairly because they get paid less in a different role. 

Here’s a bright idea! Why don’t you try and train to be a doctor then so you can earn a doctors wage! No thank you I’d rather stamp my feet like a toddler instead and complain that I haven’t got what I haven’t worked for and claim that I’m oppressed.

Pay Transparency and Gender Equality

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16099](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16099)

Abstract

>Since 2018 UK firms with at least 250 employees have been mandated to publicly disclose gender equality indicators. Exploiting variations in this mandate across firm size and time we show that **pay transparency closes 18 percent of the gender pay gap by reducing men's wage growth**. The public availability of the equality indicators seems to influence employers' response as worse performing firms and industries more exposed to public scrutiny reduce their gender pay gap the most. Employers are also 9 percent more likely to post wages in job vacancies, potentially in an effort to improve gender equality at entry level.",iainmf,t2_3m8b9,0.88,50,71

If everyone is to be paid the same, tests should be gender neutral. This would also account for genders other than male or female that people would like to be identified.

Physical fitness test should be cater to the job, not the gender. Military is a profession, not a welfare program.

This webpage, although a little outdated, gives a brief outline of the scoring standards for fitness tests of all US military services. ([https://mybaseguide.com/military-fitness-tests/](https://mybaseguide.com/military-fitness-tests/))

The one for the Army is a little outdated. The former test, APFT, was gender discriminatory. The new test, ACFT was initially supposed to be gender neutral. Then they changed it to where the scoring would be gender neutral, but females would get more promotion points for the same score. Then they changed one component of the test, from the leg tuck to the plank, and also made the scoring gender discriminatory. The most recent scoring for the test is ([https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/acft/ACFT\_scoring\_scales\_220323.pdf](https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/acft/ACFT_scoring_scales_220323.pdf)) .

I also hold the view that physical tests should also be AGE neutral. In the case of jobs or ranks that don't require high physical standards, make the physical tests less demanding ( a General doesn't need the same physical fitness as an infantryman/infantrywoman/infantryperson ).

FYI, the intelligence test for the US military is called the ASVAB, and is gender neutral.

For the argument that females bring skills other than physical fitness, if any such skill is important, it should be measured in a gender neutral way.

In case they need females for a specific task, a temporary limited exemption may be made (example: Cultural Support Teams that were useful in Muslim countries).  But a service wide exemption is unfair.

For the argument that females are generally less stronger that males and that should be accounted for: There is no reason to give special exceptions to any category. Why don't we categorize by height then? Why not by eye color, or hair color? What about gender makes it necessary to categorize by that? Also, combat is gender neutral.",jacare_o,t2_14fj8j,0.85,1966,307

I can't understand feminist non-sense. Men and women must have equal access to employment, which they do. The fact that there is a pay gap does not mean anything. For example, women might have different priorities in life and less experience compared to men. Also, they choose different professions that pay less and are more likely to work part-time. Assuming that women get paid less than men within the same post/company, even though they have the same qualifications, experience and performance, then it could be said that women do not negotiate their salaries hard enough or prefer to apply to lower paying posts/adverts, because they perceive these positions as less competitive.

The more prosperous and stable a society is, the more free women feel to make those choices. If a country has a strong welfare safety net, (paid for by men’s taxes of course, since only men are net taxpayers over their lifetimes), plenty of government services & support etc, strong laws enforcing alimony & child support, and plenty of marriageable men with stable incomes, then women do not feel pressure to maximise their incomes.

Gender earnings gaps only occur in wealthy western countries. For example, Iran has zero gender gap in STEM. Iranian women need the security of a professional income to ensure their family does not end up in poverty. Women are just as willing to become engineers as men are in those circumstances.

Feminists should celebrate a high gender earnings gap because it’s simply a sign that women in that society are safe, protected and economically secure, and thus are able to prioritise quality of life and personal fulfilment over the sacrifices required to maximise their incomes.",EricAllonde,t2_ynh8y,0.86,94,48

A millionaire woman is exploiting current gender issues (the whole ""women in programming"" business) to get enough money to send her daughter to RPG camp (where children learn to program). She aimed to raise just under a grand and has, so far, raised over $21k.

She's doing this because, supposedly, the girl's two brothers said ""she's a girl and therefore can't make games"". I suspect that, in actuality, it's just her millionaire mother wanting some $$$.

This is an exploitation of a minor, exploitation of current gender issues and a breach of multiple of Kickstarter's rules (it's both not a project and also charity).

Please report this Kickstarter for violation of either of these offenses.

Self posted so I don't get Karma, complete article below.

> Susan Wilson, one of the “Most Powerful Women Entrepreneurs” according to CNN, is using Kickstarter to raise money for her 9 year old daughter’s schooling. The goal is $829, but Kickstarter users have pledged over $21,000.  This is borderline abuse of the Kickstarter system and the whole kicktstart makes use of the current rise of gender issues in video gaming, ‘Men VS. Women’ to populate it self .

> The Kickstarter has made a ridiculous amount of money and it’s still racking in some. Luckily nobody has backed using $10,000 pledge *shudders* yet.

> Pledge $10,000 or more

> ROCK STAR REWARD LEVEL: At this level, you get everything from the previous levels plus a personal apology from her brothers and the satisfaction of knowing that you’ve not only started a career, you’ve also helped to fund future courses in computer programming for her along with more (and better) games!

> Limited (5 of 5 remaining)

> Estimated delivery: Jul 2013

> Looking at the comments section of the Kickstarter, its clear backers are in favor of what Susan is doing – effectively taking advantage of them.

> I hope Kickstarter looks into this and does something about it.

Relevant quote:

“The data clearly shows women in management aren’t accessing the same earning opportunities as men. This is partly due to the fact that women gravitate to roles the market typically assesses as being of lower value. For example, we know female KMPs are more likely to be in support roles such as human resources than line roles such as heads of finance.”

""Pay equity"" is therefore being redefined. It no longer means the same pay for the same work. It has been redefined entirely to mean that women must earn the same as men.

How to achieve that if women keep going into roles like teaching or HR, and men keep going into roles like finance and engineering? If the agenda is to get the pay outcomes of men and women the same, there's going to be a concerted push now to simply push women into those other roles no matter what the cost, and irrespective of discrimination against men. We're already seeing this now in the tech sector, with an entire industry providing scholarships that are solely reserved for women. The same will happen in finance, management and engineering. Of course if scholarships alone don't work, women are just going to be parachuted into the senior management roles by way of quotas.

What a time to belong to an oppressed minority that earns more degrees than men, and has an entire industry on their side to ensure they'll get the plum jobs without having to make the same sacrifices or commitments.

Every single day, if I stumble upon an art forum, I see pictures or drawings of naked women. Because they're seen as beautiful and powerful, as always. 

Every single day, I hear women complain about men's appearance. Through their weight, choice of clothing or just personnal hairstyle.

Every single time, if I go to a public service like a restaurant, my girlfriend gets the first looks, greetings, compliments and smiles from everyone. Whilst I'm lucky if someone pays attention to me or doesn't kick me out for not trusting me.

Every single day as I work in customer service, men greet me and smile as I pass their products at my cash register. Women don't even look up or say hello, some refuse to go to cash registers with men.

Every single day, my female co workers get greeted, congratulated for their jobs and supported by the boss (ironically female). Me and my men co workers get fired and ignored all the time.

Every single day as I open up a browser, I'm reminded that there is a function to only see female-ran businesses, none for men. Whilst I never worked or went anywhere that had men as managers, but people still think there's a systemic patriarchy.

Every single day women freely touch my hair, arms, chest and butt, whilst I have to be careful to not even brush a woman or I get a warning and a life time of being titled as a predator.

Every single day I see women being put on a pedestal, glorifying their bodies, beauty and mindset by other men and women. Just for being a woman.

Every single day, I'm reminded that some friends of mine didn't care that an ex beat me and yelled at me in our relationship, still talking and laughing with her whilst if I were the one to have done that, would I still have any friends at all?

108,pfve84,2021-09-01,MensRights,"Canada now officially discriminates against men regarding ""equal pay for equal work""","As of today, the [*Pay Equity Act*] (https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-4.2/page-1.html) is officially law in Canada. While it has largely flown under the radar, this bill specifically *excludes* men from protections regarding equal pay for equal work. Here is the final, official language of the new act that came into full effect on Aug 31, 2021 (emphasis mine):

> The purpose of this Act is to **achieve pay equity** through proactive means by redressing the systemic gender-based discrimination in the compensation practices and systems of employers that is experienced by employees who occupy positions in **predominantly female job classes** so that they receive equal compensation for work of equal value, while taking into account the diverse needs of employers, and then to **maintain pay equity** through proactive means.

Basically, this is a new legal interpretation and regulatory system that only protects **female jobs** from what it defines as ""unfair renumeration"" (and even worse, these ""job class"" definitions are being decided in absurd ways, but let's ignore that whole can of worms for the moment). The legalese of the act then establishes what it means to be a ""female job class"", and how ""pay equity"" – not equality, mind you, but a completely different thing called ""equity"" – will be achieved. And it is as one-sided and male-hating as you might expect.

You see, feminists learned quickly from the lessons of Google and others, where they watched in horror as a fair and objective review of renumeration uncovered more men than women being underpaid. That kind of misstep did significant damage to their ""wage gap"" narrative. And feminism is not in the business of giving men a fair shake. So this is their most recent attempt to regain control of the situation, as the feminists with power in the government, academia, and other large and well-funded organizations all drafted, championed, and lobbied successfully to get this bill passed. Full of built-in unfairness, subjective terms and processes, and open to all kinds of abuse, this new law is feminism's crowning glory...a veritable ode to misandry in all its loathsome splendor.

Even if – as some have argued – this type of law will not work as intended to funnel more and more money to women, that's not the point here. I argue that the real gain for these extreme gender ideologues under this system will be to maintain the narrative of female oppression and continue promoting the myth of the wage gap, which is how they maintain their personal and organizational power and influence. In the next few years, they will be able to point to the numbers coming out of these regulations and say: ""See, the *Pay Equity Act* found and resolved hundreds of millions of dollars of unpaid work for women."" People won't realize that the law was rigged to *only* find those cases for women (and even worse to find ones that don't exist), and to completely ignore men. No one wants to accept that their government is actively oppressing an entire group of people. Yet...here we are. Without objective data to show that men are actually the ones suffering from discrimination regarding pay, feminists will be able to win the narrative war with their misinformation, and the general public will just overlook the men – perhaps their brothers, or their fathers – who are (sometimes literally) killing themselves for a pittance, or who have been unemployed for years, because that is just one person, and they have bought into the myth of overall systematic female oppression.

So how can this be legal? IANAL, but this law will very likely survive a challenge under Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Honestly, I doubt that a futile attempt to remove/replace this will even be forthcoming. For a long time now, Canadian courts have been interpreting human rights laws that grant widespread legal protections in such a way as to only apply to ""historically marginalized identities"", which has resulted in many situations where men are simply invisible and disposable to society, including extremely poor outcomes for men in family law, child custody, employment (especially in the public sector), education, plus all of the new crimes being written into law that somehow only men can commit. If you can change the meaning of words (which has been the undermining power of postmodern thought for decades, and why it has become so popular amongst the woke crowd), you don't even have to repeal or change a country's laws, because they just suddenly mean something else through the seemingly natural influence of linguistic drift (just think about how ""equity"" has replaced the word ""equality"", sometimes literally, though often equality is just interpreted to mean something different nowadays). So this unfair law will not be gone any time soon, any more than those other sexist practices in Canada – and let's not be blinded by false hope here...many of these attacks on men began under different political parties – are ever going to get fixed.

Normalizing single parenting and changes in gender roles were due to advancements in medicine and plentiful human population, not feminism.","**Introduction**

Feminists often complain that traditional gender roles in marriage were a result of patriarchy and women having no rights, but they looked at it through a presentist point of view. Yes, single parenthood was taboo historically, but it wasn't realistic. As a woman, you had to get pregnant with several kids to populate the Earth and even make up for all the kids who died due to high infant mortality rates. We didn't have prenatal care, medicines, baby formula, child support, birth control pills, etc. Pregnancy was very dangerous and maternal mortality rates were high, and you had become pregnant constantly back then to populate Earth and compensate for all the children who died. People didn't even name kids until they were a few years old. You didn't have baby formula and unless you had someone to be a wet nurse, you had to breastfeed the babies yourself. Women couldn't be incapacitated by childbirth and take care of kids with potential infant mortality to nurture them to make sure they safe and then provide for the kids all by herself. Some tribal societies and other communities may have had women rely on non-spouses, but overall, having two parents was crucial. Men had to provide for children, and even women worked all the time back then and so did children to support the family because one parent wasn't enough given that we needed to nurture children and make sure they wouldn't die and become pregnant several times. Women weren't forbidden from working historically, and men weren't the sole breadwinners. That's just a 1950s America thing. It's a myth women didn't work to support the family with him, because everyone in the family needed to work, and single parenting was rare and difficult.

**Changes in traditional gender roles and family was caused by now-sufficient human populations, medicine and technology advancements, not feminism.**

Infant mortality and maternal mortality rates declined in the 20th century, which is why in the 2nd half of the decade, single parenthood became more normalized. The reason wasn't due to feminism, but because the invention of prenatal care, baby formula, medicines and more knowledge on how to handle a pregnancy safely alongside a now populated-enough Earth made it convenient to safely take care of children by oneself. Funny thing is, even now, it's still often difficult for many parents to do by themself. Most people raised by single moms fare quite well, but there is an increased risk of issues. In non-Western countries, these gender roles still exist not because they're backwards, but because they still live in these harsh environments where these inconveniences exist. Just look at Africa.

It's still an issue in the West, too. Although the evidence is mixed, [quite a lot](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1068316X.2020.1774589?fbclid=IwAR3LdQCK5jhuU1qOCfwfgSCUfx4NxHXQKccQ3u_8RTGl68VOBg2yZJc1TRQ) [of evidence](https://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/Experiments.pdf?fbclid=IwAR232YpHqPKT--eQwm4ngH43sq-3HMC6H9-c6tdJjjkhwUAvqEAcOS_6B3o) [shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3904543/?fbclid=IwAR0wk37MHF12JoiKMXTtdGWztP6u8yYLwlvomjYLXD9LRth7KlRAdznvPzQ) that being raised by a single parent can increase the risk of kids dealing with delinquency and crime or emotional and behavioral issues, even when controlling for income, family history, and many other factors. Some stats show that it has to do with socioeconomic problems, which is why single parenting isn't good if you can't make the money to provide for kids all by yourself, but some studies show even when controlling for socioeconomic factors, single parenting does increase the risk of problems. The evidence is mixed, but some evidence shows children fare worse without a father, and some studies show this isn't a causation and some research shows it is. Even having stepdads didn't improve it. I don't mind gay couples raising kids, because they are two-parents and one can use the gender roles fathers normally had for supporting kids, but single parenting, although often okay in our more convenient environment, can in many other cases, do harm. [Even in egalitarian countries](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40865-021-00183-7.pdf?pdf=button%20sticky&fbclid=IwAR2amf8juqnV-NoHB6mphZD8-NuXy79SK7e4IoIiPVt-x9WQ3rbw13NIMxo) and many European countries, (see: link https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/659870/IPOL_STU(2020)659870_EN.pdf) even when controlling for many factors, single motherhood increased risk of problems to children but not single fatherhood. Typically, having a close relationship with a father lowered these risks. A well-written *Slate* [article](https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/07/single-motherhood-worse-for-children.html) clarifies everything:

>Single mothers, even from wealthier families, have less time. They are less likely to be able to monitor their kids. They do not have a partner who can relieve them when they are tired or frustrated or angry with their kids. This isn’t just a question of taking kids to the array of pampered extracurricular activities that many affluent, two-parent families turn to; it’s about the ways in which two sets of hands, ears, and eyes generally make parenting easier. 

Obviously, many children raised by a single mom do just fine, but there is an increased risk of problems caused by single motherhood or growing up without a father. Obviously, gay couples who raise kids usually did really well, but they were two parents, and they played their roles that fathers could've played. Single parenthood, on the other hand, can be risky. See? Even to this very day, although single parenthood is much more achievable thanks to advances in medicine and technology to handle safer pregnancies and the need to have several children for species survival no longer being necessary, it can still potentially cause issues. In other countries, we still have the inconveniences of the past though, which is why they don't adapt to the times, not backwardness.

Now, [contrary to popular belief](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44735319.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A199b367927cb82179fca2b1fa966b2a2&ab_segments=&origin=&initiator=&acceptTC=1&fbclid=IwAR3Izbwy3N8InfXYjQZ9fdwtwquMiS0UaozFpqLC310nsMfMe1WDK3J3bms), it wasn't just men historically who had jobs and made money. Women had jobs and shared these gender roles, making money. Even children had jobs and made money because everyone needed to support the family because people would have several kids and we needed as much resources as possible to support several kids with high infant mortality rates. The male breadwinner/female housewife concept is a 20th century Anglosphere thing. Men did marry later than women and women did rely on men's income because women had to marry and reproduce at a young age to populate the Earth when her reproductive value was at its peak, and men didn't have to begin reproductive careers young as much because they don't have the tendency to carry the baby and only carry one at a time, 9 months each. Because very young women did not have the wealth/resources to support a child all on her own, aside from working to make that wealth, she needed an older, wealthy man to help support her, too, and who had enough money to pay a sufficient dower in case he died or divorced from her and she needed enough wealth to support herself and her kids (that's why dowers existed). This is why age gaps of older men and younger women were evolutionarily beneficial. It wasn't usually a 30 year difference, but a 5 to 10 year difference. [In fact](https://www.cold-takes.com/hunter-gatherer-gender-relations-seem-bad/amp/?fbclid=IwAR2q6EuRLvxnyqEhopbTrayV9Cm2xAbGcINrs9c7gDFl-zKoeSpr2PxVvwI), mainstream researchers were incorrect when they made headlines claiming that the pre-agricultural Stone Age societies were generally egalitarian about gender. [In fact, in the Stone Age, age gaps in sexual relationships were very common, and have been common for 250,000+ years](https://www.sciencealert.com/fathers-have-been-older-than-mothers-for-250000-years-study-finds).

This is why having premarital sex wasn't good, because birth control wasn't as effective as now and so unwanted pregnancies were very high. Child support didn't exist as much either. A woman could not have a pregnancy without a husband, and thus, shotgun weddings existed for premarital pregnancies.  Otherwise, you'd have no choice to get an abortion because you couldn't bring a child into this world if you couldn't care for it enough or it'd die or suffer. Men could only have sex with escorts, and escorts were not expected to become mothers and often engaged in infanticides or sterilized themselves. Men could never have sex with any unmarried woman, contrary to what feminists say. The invention of the birth control, which is 99.7% effective, is what started the sexual revolution because people could now easily deter illegitimate children from being born. Feminism didn't start the sexual revolution. The pill's invention did.

In fact, a [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27804061/) found shotgun marriages weren't necessarily more likely to divorce. They only divorced more if they were white or wealthy. Black and poor couples were not more likely to divorce because they probably felt a commitment to this marriage. [In fact](https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/08/myths-about-single-mothers-what-bloggers-and-pundits-are-getting-wrong-about-them.html), most unwanted pregnancies were from men the woman had relationship with, and many times, lived with. However, it wasn't unusual for the relationship to have began not that long ago, and they potentially didn't relate or were emotionally distant. Nonetheless, these weren't just mere one-night stands. Most unwanted pregnancies came from women who didn't use enough birth control, if at all, and most simply said they didn't mind getting pregnant or thought they wouldn't. Just 2% said they couldn't afford birth control. They often refused to use birth control. These people should've used birth control consistently, and if they can't take care of the baby, unless they can deal with a shotgun wedding or unless the man can provide enough child support and the mother can feel she can make her kids grow up prosperous, an abortion shouldn't be viewed as a mere choice, but necessary.

[Already, many changes such as later-age marriages and decline of age gaps already happened in Western and Northern Europe in the early 20th century](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/files/documents/2020/Jan/un_1990_patterns_of_first_marriage_-_timing_and_prevalence.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1VmUDAChQvwsR8s4rkRnAQo15VaSOnBF0dGBwI1fJMm-2-DjD5fV1WKHQ) (but not as much in the US) because of their advancements already happening at the time more compared to outside Europe), with the typical marriage age being higher and average age gap being smaller in European countries compared to other countries, including the U.S. at the time. Europe was becoming more modernized early. This is due to European countries having a larger drop than the U.S. in [maternal](https://www.gapminder.org/documentation/documentation/gapdoc010.pdf) and [child](https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality) mortality rates at the time. Compare the infant mortality rate [in the US](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1041693/united-states-all-time-child-mortality-rate/) to [European countries](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26465837_Rural_Infant_Mortality_in_Nineteenth_Century_Norway) in the 1800s, too, and you'll see it was much more common in the US. These changes happened earlier in Europe than the US way before second wave feminism, yet people think second wave feminists caused this change. They didn't. Maternal and infant mortality rates declined dramatically in the 20th century, prenatal care and baby formula were invented, the Earth began to have billions of people, etc., and that's why nuclear families and traditional gender roles in marriage became less normalized, not because of feminism.

**Discrimination against men leads to more problems in families, and** **most deadbeat dads aren't selfish men who don't care for their kids**\*\*.\*\*

So now we can see that this concept that nuclear families or having two parents are outdated isn't yet completely true. Women are told they can handle single parenting but many still have to rely on a husband to co-parent with her these days. Some of them could handle single parenting a child successfully, but it can be a difficult task sometimes. Having a positive male role model is what helps boys and girls prosper and actually deters ""toxic masculinity"" when you have more masculinity, but in a positive way, shown to them as children. [Most deadbeat dads aren't refusing to support a child, but often are poor, unemployed or paid a low wage](https://www.fatherly.com/love-money/deadbeat-dad-the-myth-and-reality-of-americas-feckless-fathers). Most child support pays are done by men with little to no money, and some of them deal with women **who don't file for support because they don't want their child to see their father**. In fact, research on deadbeat dads found that they usually did try to pay child support, and the ones who didn't were unable to due to poverty, but they often still tried their hardest to contribute in some way. Although just 61% of child support payments were made by men to the mothers of their children, [the percentage of mothers who didn't live with their kids who did not pay child support was equal to that of the percentage of fathers who did not pay](https://time.com/3921605/deadbeat-dads/). This means dads who didn't live with a child paid more often than mothers who didn't live with a child! [Unfortunately though, the court system has a bias favoring women in custody battles](http://www.breakingthescience.org/SJC_GBC_analysis_intro.php) and women initiate most divorces. Fathers now are seen as secondary parents.

As you can see, people don't seem to realize why nuclear families, men being wealthy, age gaps of older men and younger women, etc. were normalized and why single parenthood, unwanted pregnancies, fornication before the invention of the pill, etc. were stigmatized because people are presentists. Many countries still have the inconveniences of the past, which is why they haven't changed their gender roles, not due to backwardness, and the Western countries force them all to be like us, and call these countries ""developing"", even if they're a country like China or Saudi Arabia, which are richer or powerful countries for not being copycats of the West. Even now, some parents have to rely on traditional gender roles, and although single parenthood can work out, having a father and having two parents, at the very least, is ideal. I don't mind gay couples adopting kids though. In fact, the wage gap is mostly explained by women becoming mothers, not discrimination. [In any country (even egalitarian ones)](https://www.henrikkleven.com/uploads/3/7/3/1/37310663/kleven-landais-sogaard_nber-w24219_jan2018.pdf), the pay gap didn't exist until a woman became a mother. This is an example of how hard it can be to work and be a mother concurrently. It's able to be done, but not necessarily.

**Men vs. women's reproductive rights**

If child support doesn't work for you and the man because he's poor and can't provide, then you better go get an abortion if you aren't financially stable enough or capable of taking care of the kids all on your own, which is already a hard task, even in ""egalitarian"" countries. Most unwanted pregnancies were found to be from a complete absence, or at the very least, inconsistent, use of birth control. The pill is 99.7% effective when used correctly, and there's no evidence that factors like weight necessarily deter it from working effectively. Most women with unwanted pregnancies due to no birth control usually were able to afford it and were simply found to be making foolish reasoning with their behaviors (cited above). Although birth control should be free, women who are unable to have a baby right now should be using birth control consistently in order to stop unwanted pregnancies.",DemolitionMatter,t2_q6migj7k,0.89,127,31
117,17cu29g,2023-10-21,MensRights,My complaint to the New Zealand government regarding gender budgeting.," Kia Ora,  


## Introduction

This is a complaint of discrimination against men and boys in the Gender Budgeting conceptualisation, process, and execution.

Discrimination on the basis of sex and gender is illegal in New Zealand law and international human rights law.

In 2020 I raised the issue of including men and boys if the treasury chose to use a ‘gender lens’ to prevent discrimination. See Annex 1

### Definition

Gender budgeting is described in a number of ways and always includes both women and men.

* “Gender budgeting is about ensuring that the different needs and experiences of women, men, and gender diverse people are considered in the budget process and in the allocation of funding and resources.”[1](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#m_-8764448508076273521_sdfootnote1sym)
* The 2023 Budget says “Gender budgeting is a powerful tool for understanding how and to what extent people will be affected differently by initiatives depending on their gender. Applying a gender lens ensures that budgets can support a gender-equitable, inclusive future and do not embed inequalities further.”[2](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#m_-8764448508076273521_sdfootnote2sym)
* A 2018 working paper presented by the New Zealand Treasury says that: “Gender budgeting can help improve gender equality by identifying and classifying expenditure that is likely to have a positive or negative impact on a particular gender.” And go on to say: “Gender equality refers to equality of outcome between the genders, so that girls and boys, men and women, **all have equal outcomes in terms of health, education, employment.**”

## Gender budgeting currently discriminates against men and boys

Although the formal definition of gender budgeting includes both women and men, men’s issues are excluded from the gender budgeting pipeline.

### Conceptualisation

The common understanding of the purpose of gender budgeting must not cause discrimination. Although the formally stated goal of gender budgeting is to benefit both women and men, it is overwhelmingly understood to be about addressing women’s issues. This difference between formally stated goals and personal conceptualisation creates a bias leading to discrimination against men and boys. Staff who have internalised gender budgeting as a “women’s issue” will not give the required attention to gender budgeting issues for men and boys.

The conceptualisation of gender budgeting as being about women is seen in the development, execution and discussion of gender budgeting.

### Process – Gender budgeting trial only evaluated the impact on women and girls

The **process** of applying a ‘gender lens’ must not discriminate. It must make it possible *and* likely to identify and address issues for men and boys *as well as* for women and girls. Unfortunately, the development and testing of the gender budgeting pilot discriminated against men and boys.

A briefing[3](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#m_-8764448508076273521_sdfootnote3sym) to the Minister for Women, *“Review of the Gender Budgeting Pilot and next steps”*, describes the gender budgeting pilot. “The pilot was intended to incorporate a gender lens across initiatives, to identify policies that had a direct and/or indirect impact on improving outcomes for women and girls and policies that have a negative or unintended effect on women so that these effects could be challenged and/or amended.” **There is no indication that the gender budgeting pilot was intended to identify impacts for men and boys**.

The briefing describes the three key questions asked to participating agencies. **None of the questions include men and boys**. The questions were:

* What kind of impact does the initiative have on **women and girls** overall?
* What kind of impact does the initiative have on **wāhine** Māori?
* Does the initiative impact on another specific group of **women and girls**?

### Execution and outcomes – Gender budgeting only applied to women and girls.

The **execution** of the gender budgeting must not discriminate. Intending to include issues for men and boys as well as for women and girls must be demonstrated in the gender analysis and inclusion of experts for both men’s issues and women’s issues,

The **outcomes** must not discriminate. Both women and men must benefit from gender budgeting. The Gender Budgeting section of the 2023 Budget only focuses entirely on women, even when budget allocations provides greater benefit to men. For example “**Improvements in accessing care records** to make fit-for-purpose services will benefit survivors, of whom **40 percent have been identified as women** by the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in State Care...”. See Annex 2 for more.

## A non-discriminatory approach

To be non-discriminatory gender budgeting must include, but is not limited to:

* Explicitly include both women’s issues and men’s issues in policies and processes.
* Include experts in men’s issues as well as women’s issues. It is not sufficient to rely on the Ministry for Women to provide all of the expertise. The Ministry does not have a mandate to have expertise on men’s issues. Nor is it sufficient to simply have men present if those men are not providing expertise on men’s issues if experts in women's issues are present.
* Evaluate the impact of budgeting decisions on men and boys as well as women and girls.

## Human rights obligations

International human rights law requires the government to ensure equal enjoyment of rights for women and men. See Article 3 of both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. There is also a non-derogable obligation to immediately eliminate discrimination.

## Action required

The New Zealand government is obligated to not discriminate and to prevent discrimination. Please tell me what actions you will be taking to address discrimination against men and boys in the gender budgeting conceptualisation, process, execution and outcomes.

I look forward to your response.

## My letter in 2020

to Tim.Ng
2. Kia Ora,  
I hope you are the right person to contact about this, my apologies if you are not. If that is the case please forward this to the relevant person.
3. Regarding the issue of the treasury using a gender lens, I would like to point out that, should the treasury decide to adopt a gender lens, due diligence requires considering both women's and men's gender issues. Currently, the Ministry for Women is the government's gender expert, but having and maintaining expertise on men's gender issues is outside of their mandate. This leaves a gap that would need to be filled.
4. Unfortunately, most experts on men's issues are busy working at the coal face providing social services for men and I am not aware of any organisation that provides the kind of expertise that would be required.
5. I would appreciate it if you could make a note of this, so if/when the decision about a gender lens is revisited the issue of getting expertise men's gender issues will be discussed
6. Thank you for your time.  
Regards

#### Gender Budgeting

1. For the first time, Budget 2023 includes a gender budgeting ‘snapshot’. Gender budgeting is a powerful tool for understanding how and to what extent people will be affected differently by initiatives depending on their gender. Applying a gender lens ensures that budgets can support a gender-equitable, inclusive future and do not embed inequalities further. Fifteen agencies (triple the number of agencies from last year’s pilot) participated in the Gender Budgeting Exercise for Budget 2023 and covered 27 initiatives. Manatū Wāhine Ministry for Women supported agencies to identify the anticipated impacts on women and girls, particularly for Māori, through a Gender Budgeting Toolkit. The initiatives included in the exercise are likely to achieve targeted outcomes for whānau, pregnant women, sole parents and sole mothers, wāhine Māori, Pacific women, disabled women, working women and ākonga students. Building on the success of a prior prototype, the **Ngā Tini Whetū** initiative will provide targeted support for 650 wāhine hapū and their whānau and tamariki. It will deliver this by extending its focus to include the wellbeing of hapū māmā, whānau and pēpi in their first 1,000 days, supporting a healthy start to life.
2. Nearly half of all ākonga (48 percent) in schools receiving or eligible for the **Ka Ora, Ka Ako Healthy School Lunches programme** are girls. While girls directly benefit from the same overall positive impacts, nutritional lunches also improve the regularity and health of menstrual cycles, which is directly linked to nutrition. This mana-enhancing initiative reduces stress and grocery bills for whānau. The programme also supports teen parent units, providing healthy lunches to wāhine hapū, which supports their immediate health, mitigates the health risks of food insecurity, and is the earliest possible intervention for their babies.
3. Women have different experiences in the world of work than men, and this can put women at an economic disadvantage. Compared to men, women experience higher rates of unemployment and underemployment, often work in less secure, more precarious employment, and undertake greater caring and family responsibilities. Pacific women are a priority focus under the **Pacific Employment Action Plan**. Funded projects including Tupu Tai, a public sector internship programme for Pacific students which attracts a high proportion of women (60 percent to 70 percent), and the Pacific cadetship scheme, which has at least 50 percent of placements reserved for women will help address systemic workforce issues affecting Pacific women and girls.
4. Funding to permanently reinstate the Training Incentive Allowance will support sole parents and disabled people and their carers to enter higher education and training. Since 2021, the initiative has supported approximately 5,000 clients, of whom 90 percent have been women. The flow-on impacts for tamariki and the intergenerational benefits of parents holding educational qualifications will be particularly beneficial for sole parents, who make up 75 percent of clients and who are disproportionately women. The long-term impacts of improving women’s education, which supports entry to higher-pay employment, can reduce gender and ethnic pay gaps. The **wage supplement to replace the minimum wage exemption** is expected to directly improve the incomes and wellbeing of disabled women, including wāhine Māori, alleviating financial stress and aiding independence.
5. Gender analysis of the **Industry Transformation Plans** (ITP) has highlighted an opportunity to address the underrepresentation of women in male-dominated sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture and technology. The **ITP Digital Technology package** aims to increase women’s participation in the technology sector from 27 percent to 50 percent by 2030, through initiatives such as ‘Learn while you earn’ opportunities and supporting employers to foster attractive, supportive working environments to attract and retain a diverse workforce.
6. Transport agencies participated in the pilot for the first time, recognising the gender dimension of transport. As women are more likely to have lower income levels than men, work part time or casually, and have greater caring responsibilities, they are more likely to rely on public transport and use it in off-peak hours. Women, particularly Māori and Pacific women, are also less likely than men to have driver licences, affecting their independence and access to employment and training. Budget 2023 includes funding to support the delivery, connectivity, and sustainability of public transport across New Zealand and enhance women’s employment opportunities. For example, the **Future of Rail** initiative aims to increase the number of women working in KiwiRail’s workforce from 18 percent to 21 percent by 2025. Additional funding to **maintain public transport services** will ensure everyone in New Zealand has access to safe and reliable public transport, particularly the women and girls who are more reliant on these services or who make multiple trips per day.
7. Budget 2023 funds several initiatives aimed at supporting victims and survivors of family and sexual violence and eliminating violence, both online and offline. The gendered impacts of **abuse in care** for women, girls and Māori cause particular and distinct harms, including medical, emotional and physical harms. **Improvements in accessing care records** to make fit-for-purpose services will benefit survivors, of whom 40 percent have been identified as women by the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in State Care, and support the wider Crown response and redress. One in three women experiences intimate partner violence, and wāhine Māori are more likely to be subjected to violence than any other ethnicity or gender. Nearly three-quarters of women (73 percent) affected by family violence do not interact with formal services or go through formal channels. Investments in **the Violence Help Portal** (part of Te Aorerekura) will provide women experiencing violence with increased and faster access to information, advice, referrals and crisis support. **Violent misogyny is a risk factor for radicalisation**, and **a common feature of violent extremism and terrorism.** Initiatives funded under the **Christchurch Call** can reduce online and offline violence and violent rhetoric against women and girls, supporting women and girls to stay safe online.

What can I do??,"I used to think the whole battle between feminism and men’s rights was overblown or not a problem in the UK, but I've now seen just how disgusting it is...


The company used to run two sessions, teaching in total about 300 kids each weekend, one for paying families and a free one for families with low income. They are now scrapping the paying one and changing the criteria for the free one to include girls, but not boys.

These kids are 7-11 years old and have no clue and don’t care about sexism or gender shit. And now boys have literally no way of going to these classes. I know families where a 9 year old brother and 11 year old sister attended the paying class, now that it's scrapped, the sister goes for free and the brother is denied entry. I've seen a mother try to explain to her son why ""It's a good thing that they're being inclusive and that he can no longer go to the classes""... It doesn't matter if you think there is a problem with people/genders/whatever’s being under represented, this is clearly not a solution at all!!!


Is this really legal? Denying entry to kids based on their gender? I feel like complaining or voicing this opinion will just get me fired, but I also can't really stand helping them achieve this discrimination.",rrtyui33,t2_jstk4x6,0.96,1673,180
119,18kaq2x,2023-12-17,MensRights,Real sick of hearing feminists decry that they work and also do more house duties/chores,"[https://www.npr.org/2023/04/13/1168961388/pew-earnings-gender-wage-gap-housework-chores-child-care](https://www.npr.org/2023/04/13/1168961388/pew-earnings-gender-wage-gap-housework-chores-child-care)

""But in ""egalitarian marriages,"" wives are still spending more than double the amount of time on housework than their husbands (4.6 hours per week for women vs. 1.9 hours per week for men), and almost two hours more per week on caregiving, including tending to children.""

Feminist will use this to claim there's a gap in expected house duties, and that women are still oppressed by the oppressive patriarchy, but if you look even at this article and study, men also work more hours, almost comparable to the extra time women do in house duties in chores. Which btw, is not comparable to job hours which are more easily defined, as opposed to house duties where laundry could take one hour but the washing machine did all the work.

So, saying women do ""all the housework while paying 50/50"" is just disingenuous and more victim complex at play. The majority of couples are just trying to get by and do the best they can with their respective roles. Most people still seem to gravitate towards more traditional roles.  


Here's a study on men paying footing the bill more: [Who pays? With money matters, traditional gender roles stick. - CSMonitor.com](https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Saving-Money/2014/0917/Who-pays-With-money-matters-traditional-gender-roles-stick) ",Nipplespice,t2_nc5mjtu17,0.93,162,54
120,ele1yz,2020-01-07,MensRights,"In Canada, men are not afforded equal pay rights under Justin Trudeau's feminist inspired policy.","Justin Trudeau is the [openly feminist](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-35836279/justin-trudeau-i-ll-keep-saying-i-m-a-feminist) prime minister of Canada, and has integrated feminism directly into his tenure and policy making decisions. It's interesting to note what this has meant- direct discrimination and less rights for male citizens. In Canada, the law does not afford male workers equal pay rights.

Trudeau passed the [Pay Equity Act of 2018](http://www.payequity.gov.on.ca/en/AboutUs/Pages/the_act.aspx) earlier this year. It is presented as being a measure that guarantees equal pay, but when the language of the bill is examined, there's a caveat- men are actually not protected, and it 
is not illegal to pay men less. Take a look:

>The Act requires private sector employers with ten or more employees and all public sector employers to value and compare jobs usually done by women to those usually done by men in an objective and consistent way using factors of skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions. A female job class must receive compensation that is **at least** equal to the compensation that is paid to a male job class of equal or comparable value.

Notice what I emphasized- compensation that is at *least* equal, which means it can either be equal, or can be more. And notice the wording, it is specifically **not** gender neutral, it says that a female job class must receive at least as much a male...there is no wording about how the genders must be equal, or prohibiting one gender being paid more than another.

Furthermore more, under the *Employment Equity Act*, men are again specifically left out, as the 4 [designated classes](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-service-commission/services/appointment-framework/employment-equity-diversity/employment-equity-groups.html) are as follows:

- Women

- Disabled workers

- Visible minorities

- Aboriginal workers

While the last 3 can be justified as minority populations, including women as a protected class means that over 50% of the population is a protected class, which means that the for minority of the population *not* in that class, finding a job is much more difficult. While this affects white men the most, even for a minority man, he is still disadvantaged for being male. 

Unsurprisingly, the male unemployment rate is [consistently higher](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-222-x/2008001/sectionb/b-unemployment-chomage-eng.htm) in Canada, with men being more likely to be out of work.

Most teachers in most schools are women, Most Principals in schools are women, And most (if not ALL) janitors in most schools are men, due to the fact that it's a dirty, low paid, and physically demanding job that most women either don't want to do or can't do. That's the only reason men are given the opportunity to even work as janitors there. This is pretty much the norm in most parts of the modern world, and even some parts of the developing world.

The fact that most impressionable kids today grow up seeing this every day, week after week, month after month, year after year... is extremely discriminative and normalizes these biased gender standards and second class positioning, engraving them into a child's mind.

""Men deserve to be poor dirty hard workers, and women deserve to be leaders by default. Men belong in the background. They only exist to clean or do repairs in my world,"" is the take-away here.

And then when these female (and male) students finally graduate and go on to college, where some men are actually professors too, the students start feeling cognitive dissonance and start ego tripping and accusing those Male Teachers, because subconsciously they are feeling ""You should be a janitor and be cleaning my floors. I'm better than you. I own you.""

Campaigns of persecution and false accusations ensue against these last standing male teachers, further reinforcing this discrimination and gender bias.

And this all gets carried into the workplace. With the same attitude of gender inequality. With the same expectation of men taking all the dirty, dangerous, low paying, unwanted tasks that nobody wants, and the expectation of women to be leaders, managers, and owners who rule over you and school you like a child on what's right and wrong, and on what's okay and not okay to think or say.

Women have all the bad jobs, men are arseholes who murder their wives, and we need to rape the reputation of men as a group and provide the good jobs to women not men on the basis of gender to make all this iniquity right.

&#x200B;

You've heard the spiel, right.

&#x200B;

To this I have two words of response: Taxi. Driver. 

&#x200B;

Of course women usually primarily care for young children, and schools during the day primarily care for older children. Sure there are exceptions, higher earning mum goes out to work, dad stays home and enjoys himself with baby - good on them. Not many women want that, they want to mother the babies and they want hubby to earn well to make it easy. 

&#x200B;

Given this, and how competitive it is to reach senior positions in competitive workplaces (ie. all workplaces), I find it not surprising that there are so few married women with children in the highest levels of management, eg. board level or senior exec. I find it extraordinary and manipulated - although given the endless rounds of women promotion (literally, like into the juicy senior job everyone wants) and male reputation tarnishing I'm not surprised - that THAT THERE ARE SO MANY WOMEN IN VERY SENIOR POSITIONS. Sometimes you get a talented go-getter who gives up everything including family for career - Julie Bishop, the former foreign minister of Australia, is a good example of this. She earned it. However, given the time out for family commitments, it boggles my mind that married women with multiple children would make it to the top without being given the job based on their possession of a vagina. In other words, you need manipulation in the extreme in favour of female applicants and against male ones to get the numbers of senior women in the workplace we have now, let alone this being an example of discrimination AGAINST women.

&#x200B;

Let's get back to taxi drivers. In Australia being a taxi driver has been one of the lowest status jobs out there. They work insane hours to support families and typically earn somewhere around $8 an hour, in a socialist country like Australia where minimum wage is set at around the low $20s per hour. They have to sit all day long, which is awful for health and posture, they're exposed to the sun, they have to deal with sometimes drunk and abusive customers and not uncommonly physical assaults. Surely if we want to help low income earners, taxi drivers would be the perfect place to start. Surely a few rallies to parliament house, some politicians speaking out for them, the charities and social services organisations prioritizing taxi drivers income. Well....not exactly.

&#x200B;

Any guess why not? It wouldn't be anything to do with the fact that something like 98% of taxi drivers are men, would it? In Australia, Indian immigrant men, by the way.

&#x200B;

Look, if like me you have a dick, and one or two testicles swinging on either side of it, you're not going to get any airtime. You're the aresehole, remember? So that taxi driver who earns $8 an hour is the arsehole, oppressing that focused white or Asian early 40s women who gets promoted to chair of the board and earns a few million yearly. But he's got a dick, so we already know he's bad, so why am I even writing this?

&#x200B;

Men I have no idea what to do in a society that hates my gender so much. I mean for us as a group, on an individual personal level there's usually plenty we can do. The way I see it, things went so nuts so quickly all I can see is at least making men INTERNALLY aware of how the system is stacked against them. I share many others' skepticism of any positive change to men's conditions through the political process, or even a willingness to block their further erosion through more and more man-hatred expressed through law and social beliefs. The only thing I believe I can do beyond the personal level is to at least make as many men as possible aware of the how under siege we, as a gender, have become.

Feminists, however, do think women need to be protected. That's why they always exaggerate statistics about how prevalent violence against women is, only pay exclusive attention to female victims of violence, portray every woman as a damsel in distress who worries 24/7 about being raped/murdered while ignoring the majority of violence and murder victims who are men. They see themselves as the paternalistic protecters of women.

**Women should not be forced to marry early, become mothers or stay at home. Let's allow them to do what they want!**

Feminists don't really think this. They say they think women should be able to go to college, get an education, and not have kids or never settle down, but they actually impose new expectations. They discourage women from marrying in their early 20s because they believe in the ""[brain doesn't develop until 25](https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/brain-development-25-year-old-mature-myth.html)"" myth, even though evidence has shown that [marrying in the early 20s](https://nationalmarriageproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wheatley_StateofUnions_020222_v1.pdf) or even [late teens](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3390929/) doesn't inherently cause divorce or marital problems. They tell women they don't have to marry, sure, but they encourage them to wait until they're at least 25.

They actually have an EXPECTATION that women go to college at 18-21, get a college degree, and focus on getting a prestigious white-collar job or something and that they should make their own money. If she's not interested in marriage or career or wants to marry in early adulthood, then she's a ""victim"" of patriarchy or is taking ""risks"" before her ""brain develops"".

A lot of evidence has shown that women aren't interested in STEM inherently and that's why even in countries progressive for women like Sweden, women are underrepresented in many STEM fields, but feminists actually expect women, despite many not wanting to be in STEM, to join STEM for the sake of ""equality"".

Feminists want to normalize women not wearing bras instead of just saying whatever fuck it it's their decision to decide. We shouldn't normalize wearing it or not wearing it. Let her decide. They also wanna normalize women being just as interested in casual sex as men, but [don't realize that women aren't less willing to admit they're into casual sex. Many just aren't as into it as men](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sexual-personalities/201706/what-type-person-would-agree-have-sex-stranger), and this is true regardless of sexual orientation, country, or how safe she feels. So it's not due to sexual orientation, socialization or gender roles or worries about being raped. It's due to the male libido being spontaneous and based on release, and the female libido being more responsive and intimate.

Also, they infantilize young women between 18-22, and call them ""children"" or ""young girls"" (totally sexist language, feminists) when they date a man even just a few years older, and treat them as a bunch of little kids who cannot have responsibilities to make their own decisions. They believe if he's more than 4 years older, he's automatically a rapist by default, [even though age gaps weren't linked to abuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/10xxbp0/men_who_date_younger_women_not_more_likely_to_be/).

**Feminists don't want to liberate women from gender roles.

It's interesting to note what this has meant- direct discrimination and less rights for male citizens. In Canada, the law does not afford male workers equal pay rights.

Trudeau passed the [Pay Equity Act of 2018](http://www.payequity.gov.on.ca/en/AboutUs/Pages/the_act.aspx) earlier this year. It is presented as being a measure that guarantees equal pay, but when the language of the bill is examined, there's a caveat- men are actually not protected, and it 
is not illegal to pay men less. Take a look:

>The Act requires private sector employers with ten or more employees and all public sector employers to value and compare jobs usually done by women to those usually done by men in an objective and consistent way using factors of skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions. A female job class must receive compensation that is **at least** equal to the compensation that is paid to a male job class of equal or comparable value.

Notice what I emphasized- compensation that is at *least* equal, which means it can either be equal, or can be more. And notice the wording, it is specifically **not** gender neutral, it says that a female job class must receive at least as much a male...there is no wording about how the genders must be equal, or prohibiting one gender being paid more than another.

Furthermore more, under the *Employment Equity Act*, men are again specifically left out, as the 4 [designated classes](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-service-commission/services/appointment-framework/employment-equity-diversity/employment-equity-groups.html) are as follows:

- Women

- Disabled workers

- Visible minorities

- Aboriginal workers

While the last 3 can be justified as minority populations, including women as a protected class means that over 50% of the population is a protected class, which means that the for minority of the population *not* in that class, finding a job is much more difficult. While this affects white men the most, even for a minority man, he is still disadvantaged for being male. 

Unsurprisingly, the male unemployment rate is [consistently higher](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-222-x/2008001/sectionb/b-unemployment-chomage-eng.htm) in Canada, with men being more likely to be out of work. Despite this, the class *more* likely to be unemployed faces legalized discrimination in hiring, and the class *more* likely to be employed is given favored status.

And, can at least us acknowledge both how utterly contrary to the Feminist movement this is?

Feminists:

\- campaigned to make default custody to the mother, and then they blamed it on the Patriarchal gender norms of care for children being a woman's job, when that's much closer to their own reasoning of ""female creative force"" which Patriarchy was suppressing for millennia. Before they got it, custody went to the father, because jobs were harder before the Industrial Revolution, so the only jobs women could do were either weaving, collecting crops, making soap, tending for animals. Men had the harder jobs of ploughing, defense against bandits and wild animals, animal slaughter, forging and blacksmitting, war, etc. Only after the Industrial Revolution (which also brought for men mining and factory work, which I remind you only began to have standards of safety when women began to be employed) you could begin to say ""women were kept out of jobs, so of course they didn't have enough resources to provide for their kids alone"".

\- created models of domestic violence with men as the sole perpetuator, like the Duluth model and actively opposed Pizzey's idea of intergenerational instead of gender-based violence

\- constantly only care about stories from the perspective of female victimization, for example in Islamic countries where they complain about the abuse of girls, boys are often abused just as much, but it doesn't draw in the eyes just as much and neither appeals to what they really seek, validating their own feelings, which, when I am most charitable can be healing from trauma, but if you do that, just be honest and don't pretend to be a serious philosophical movement, about equality no less

\- portrayed marriage as an exploitative institution meant to suppress women for the benefit of men

\- complaining in the 50s and 60s of how gender representation in university is unfair, completely glossing over how many of the university students in the period they were describing have done it because of the GI Bill, you know, they had to be qualified after they fought in WW2 ?

\- hell, even sex is portrayed as an effort of males, both in humans and the animal kingdom to subjugate the females (in Beauvoir's The Second Sex, first chapter it talks of how males assert their individuality, even says bee worker drones live a life of privilege before their death, whereas everything about the female's growth and reproduction alienates them - have I told you yet how much I loathe materialists?)

\- portrayed men as forming their personhood around the oppression of women (literally, Pateman saying being an individual is derived from property ownership which is denied to women)  


>""Only masculine beings are endowed with the attributes and capacities necessary to enter into contracts, the most important of which is ownership of property in the person; only men, that is to say, are 'individuals'."" - Carol Pateman

\- even today they promote such things, according TO THEMSELVES! [here](https://youtu.be/d_SYW1ElDb8?t=1359) is Philosophy Tube presenting a Feminist philosopher giving the context for the reason for a man accepting his job is because [""when he comes home, he at least gets to boss around his wife""](https://youtu.be/d_SYW1ElDb8?t=1438)

\- oh and not to mention ""men did Patriarchy to themselves, why should we help them""

&#x200B;

Back to the original video, on top of what it Whitewashes about Feminism, look at what men's rights were the first to come to mind: ""talk about your feelings"" and ""now you can be more like women"". Thank you for the effort, but no? I don't need to be like a woman, even if that's not stigmatized.

If you want to fight gender prejudice, we'd much more appreciate, I don't know maybe not portraying masculinity as arbitrary, meaningless and fake [like Salari does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bomWsgjLQjc) ? Or, this is much more minor, eliminate the caricature of the man as a lumbering slob or the goofy father for which the wife has to be the mature one. But again, ""masculinity isn't meaningless / arbitrary"" matters more. Maybe that? Maybe that would be a worthwhile use of your effort if the most important to you is gender biases.

But have we heard Feminists talk about, idk:

\- circumcision at similar rates to FGM, considering it's more wide spread,

\- maybe analyzing why charities for men's causes always get less support, even contribute to them themselves

\- efforts to increase men's programs now that they're under half of college graduates?

No. They either ignore problems like these or others, or want to distance at all costs from being associated with men's rights if they ever do it or pay lip service to doing it, and typical case scenario for the last one, they ignore how popular culture chastises men for not being marriage material for women with 2 degrees which want the same in their husbands.

&#x200B;

The funnies part is, 2 minutes before the quote I opened with, someone from his own audience said that ""misogyny needs to be fought first before we worry about sympathy for men, sorry"", so even his own lack of self awareness of who he is talking to is abysmal.

Also, 1 minute after he went ""look at Feminism's definition and goal"", so the logic ""Feminism can't be anti-men, it's about equality"" comes in. No. Feminism is not for equality, it's anti-Patriarchy, which was something they see done by men and self-hating women and it blames all gender problems for.

Finally, 2 minutes after, tell me, Alec, are \^those stupid reasons to oppose Feminism? Their own actions and beliefs showing how they're constantly hostile to both men and history and how they'd use any defeat as ammo to blame on the same problem?

I have been with my girlfriend for a fairly long time, and we've both been through university and are starting our careers in our respective fields. She has a good job as a teacher at a nice suburban school where she makes average new-teacher money. She has been doing that for a while already, and will have 2 years experience by the time I finish my education. I have managed to line up an extraordinarily good job for when I enter the work-force, and when I do, I will start on more money than she will make with her 2 years experience, and by the end of my second year of experience, I will likely be making more money each year than she could expect at any point in her career.

She said to me that she doesn't feel like that is fair. She feels that pay-grade should follow experience. I responded with:

 ""Well, you have to remember that I'll also be expected to work for the extra money, and 65+ hour weeks may not be uncommon for me, while you are only expected to work fewer than 40 hours""

In addition to this, though I didn't say it, I have also graduated at the top of my graduating year in all of my 3 degrees, which is what allowed me to land this job in the first place.

She replied with something that offended me:

""Ohh, that's rubbish. I'll be putting in more hours cleaning the house and looking after the kids and doing the cooking.""

The thing is, we don't live together... We don't have kids... And when she's here, I'm the one who cooks...

It seems a common thread in society that sex differences in pay are something that ought to be addressed by employers, but preempting traditional gender roles and using it as a basis upon which to complain about differences in pay between totally different fields of work that require different degrees of education and achievement seems ridiculous.

Anyway, I don't know if it's totally relevant to mens rights, but it felt like it was, given that the contention was that my education, educational achievement, and field of work should be discounted because of an anticipation of traditional gender roles...",thrwawy0001,t2_j2a8m,0.73,9,17

The decline in old-school gender roles happened due to changes in environment, but many think it was due to feminism. Here's an elaboration of how this is a myth.

**Expectations that women marry young and marry older wealthier men declined due to declines in child/maternal mortality and higher population densities.**

In the past century, the [population density](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/WLD/world/population-density) of the world has skyrocketed and is expected to plateau by 2100. Maternal mortality and child mortality rates also declined, and they are now quite low now in the West especially. Historically, women were expected to start motherhood in early adulthood because her reproductive value was still high, and she could only become pregnant one at a time 9 months each, and needed to reproduce as much as she could to populate the Earth and make up for all the children who died because child mortality rates were very high. We had no prenatal care and pregnancy was very dangerous, and maternal mortality rates were high. She needed to spend a lot of her time having children and taking care of them to safeguard them before school was normalized, and people died a lot more frequently back then. Your [mortality risk was already pretty high when you were not even middle-aged yet and dying before becoming an elder was common](https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/resources/essays-monographs/2014-living-to-100/mono-li14-4a-clay.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0OlnkZ7j6jOGq3yHwu2Wh-5BThhsa6I-6vTlsquyIwP4Mo7twMw8bsQF4). Widowhood rates were super high and watching a parent die before you were 18 was more common then. In fact, contrary to popular belief, the [male breadwinner wasn't the norm historically](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2020.0020), and was just a post-Industrial Revolution Western thing when poverty decreased after the Industrlal Revolution. The West did try to spread the breadwinner tradition to other countries, too, which is why it can exist in some regions, but historically, even women and children had to work to support the family, but because women had to spend so much time with bearing children and taking care of them, [which is the REAL reason for the wage gap](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/19/17018380/gender-wage-gap-childcare-penalty), and because women had to begin marriage and family when she just hit adulthood when she was broke, she had to rely on older, wealthier men, which is why age gaps happened. Men married later because they had to accumulate wealth and resources to help support the family and even women and children had to work throughout history, and even extended family had to take care of the children because women had to spend time working to barely make ends meet. [In fact](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/female_labor_force_participation/), in sub-Saharan Africa, women work about as often as men, and men often struggle with employment a lot as well and barely make money, and they have high child labor rates because they still deal with this environment. Women work there much more than in Western countries! [Even extended family in Africa often take care of children there](https://theconversation.com/why-african-families-are-larger-than-those-of-other-continents-84611). African countries have low population densities, low life expectancies, high maternal/child mortality rates, and no prenatal care or other ways to safeguard pregnancy and extreme poverty. Yet feminists are trying to encourage women there to stop having children as much and pursue education/career, not knowing that [there's a correlation between child mortality and fertility rates, which is why Africa has high fertility rates](https://ifstudies.org/blog/african-fertility-is-right-where-it-should-be). Even in the mid-20th century, the typical marriage age went lower temporarily during the baby boom to populate the Earth again after WWII. [Studies](https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/07/single-motherhood-worse-for-children.html) even found that even to this day, single motherhood, controlling for many factors, does increase the risk of some issues for children due to the difficulty and nurturing and providing for them simultaneously. This is true even in ""egalitarian"" countries (link: [https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/659870/IPOL\_STU(2020)659870\_EN.pdf](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/659870/IPOL_STU(2020)659870_EN.pdf)).

What caused the later 20th century decline in women getting married young or marrying older men, and what caused the decline in fertility and traditional marriage gender roles was declining maternal/child mortality rates, higher population densities, and inventions like prenatal care. This is evidenced by the fact that even in the 1800s, [Europe](https://www.gapminder.org/documentation/documentation/gapdoc010.pdf) [had](https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality) [lower](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26465837_Rural_Infant_Mortality_in_Nineteenth_Century_Norway) maternal/child mortality rates [than the US](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1041693/united-states-all-time-child-mortality-rate/) and higher population densities. The US were just being founded and many states weren't founded yet, and the US founders came from Europe with not much economic convenience they had in Europe, and had to start a new society after killing the Native Americans. [The United States also had available, inexpensive land](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002115/), and when land became costlier as population densities increased, the age of marriage rose, but it still was much lower than now for aforementioned reasons. According to Alan Kulikoff in his book *From British Peasants to Colonial American Farmers*, the more land available to start working and provide for a family, the sooner people could marry. [As a result](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/files/documents/2020/Jan/un_1990_patterns_of_first_marriage_-_timing_and_prevalence.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1VmUDAChQvwsR8s4rkRnAQo15VaSOnBF0dGBwI1fJMm-2-DjD5fV1WKHQ), Europeans had less age gaps and women married a bit later. [In fact](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34914431/), population densities and fertility rates are negatively correlated, even when controlling for many factors.

**Expectations that women wait until marriage to have sex were for ensuring paternity certainty and to prevent children from being outside a married, stable family.**

Many people think that society tried to make women be asexual beings with no interest in sex and that men were allowed to have sex with as many women as possible. Well, aside from the fact that it's a myth that everyone praises promiscuous men as studs and often view them as womanizers, we also must realize that although men were allowed to fornicate historically, it was only okay for them to have sex with hookers. This is why prostitution existed. Men couldn't get pregnant, and prostitutes often sterilized themselves or engaged in infanticides if they were pregnant. Birth control wasn't very effective then and paternity tests didn't exist. Since men couldn't get pregnant, they thought men could have sex with hookers to release sexual urges, especially given that men married later. Women got pregnant, so that's why they couldn't have sex before marriage, but men were in huge trouble if they had sex with a non-hooker, and if he did, he had to marry her, especially if she got pregnant. Men who had sex with non-hookers were seen as evil predators. Once a woman was married, she could have sex all she wanted, and there wasn't any stigma against women enjoying sex, as long as it was with her spouse. This [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/yknuw7/the_myth_that_society_restricted_womens_sexuality/) of mine elaborates on these myths. We didn't have very reliable birth control then, and single parenting wasn't able to be done, and it often still is hard to do (as mentioned earlier), and many families historically needed to rely on extended families in such poor and harsh environments long, long ago. Women couldn't do it all on their own and if they fornicated back then, they could've been pregnant and shotgun weddings were important so that the child would be raised by enough people who could provide them with wealth and nourishment. Even abortion was more dangerous back then with less technology, and some of these women maybe didn't want abortions, so they would have to marry if they didn’t get abortions. Men back then also had to work up to 14 hours and had no paternity tests, so they wanted to know that child was theirs, so virginity was expected to ensure paternity certainty and prevent children from being born without a stable family. Due to the tendency for teens to have sex, many societies had women marry as teens and had teenage guys have sex with hookers to protect a young lady's virginity, and age of consent laws didn't apply to women and underage guys.

So what caused the stigma against premarital sex to decline? The sexual revolution. But what caused that revolution? It was actually the invention of the pill, not feminism, since women could now deter out-of-wedlock births. Now that single parenting, despite still being sometimes problematic, is now easier than in the past because of low maternal/child mortality rates, prenatal care, lower population densities, and accordingly, lower fertility, out-of-wedlock births and single parenthood became more accepted. Nowadays, premarital sex is normalized.

**Women entered the workforce more due to changes in environment, not feminism.**

It is true that after the Industrial Revolution in the North American and Western Europe regions, women didn't have to work as much and extended family didn't have to care of the kids as much anymore. This was when the breadwinner idea was invented and normalized. Women suddenly weren't working so much anymore. In 1880, less than 10% of American married white women were working compared to almost 25% of single white women. [Nonetheless](https://www.epi.org/blog/black-womens-labor-market-history-reveals-deep-seated-race-and-gender-discrimination/), 35.4% of married black women and 73.3% of single black women at the time were working. Black women's work participation extended over their lifetimes even after marriage whereas white women stopped working when they married. This is because black men faced so much labor market discrimination that they could barely make wages, had less stable employments, and as a result, black women had to be a co-breadwinner. [This is why black women married earlier than white women back long ago](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/2012/demo/SEHSD-WP2012-12.pdf) (and even black men married earlier than white men). Now, black people marry later because since the late 20th century, out-of-wedlock births among black people have skyrocketed and now, black people marry late, if at all. [Black people had higher infant mortality rates and thus had higher fertility rates](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edward-Sondik/publication/12227539_Annual_Summary_of_Vital_Statistics_Trends_in_the_Health_of_Americans_During_the_20th_Century/links/603193d64585158939bbc26b/Annual-Summary-of-Vital-Statistics-Trends-in-the-Health-of-Americans-During-the-20th-Century.pdf?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicHJldmlvdXNQYWdlIjoiX2RpcmVjdCJ9fQ). Now, the gap in black and white women in the workforce has faded away. So what caused more women to join the workforce? Well, it's not exactly feminism.

[Women began entering the workforce a bit more in the early 20th century](https://womensrightsny.com/womens-trade-union-league-and-the-progressive-era-1900-1920/). Single women entered especially more. Now while there's thousands of men dying at work each year, and almost workplace deaths are men, and no one gives a toss, people back then were up in arms when women were endangered at work. So many dangerous jobs were common back then and so many more deaths/injuries happened. Poor women and children worked long hours. Thus, the Women's Trade Union League began in 1903 to improve women's working lives. Clerical workers began to become half women by 1920. [In WWI, men went off to war, and many women, especially married women, had new jobs made so they could make money while men were at war](https://www.thoughtco.com/women-and-work-world-war-1-1222030). When men returned after the war, men were supposed to have their jobs back, and single women pressured married women to quit jobs so single women could have many more job opportunities. In the late 1940s and 1950s, labor demand started to shift out across a rather elastic female labor supply function. The effect persisted, and married women’s labor force participation rates rose. Because the elasticities changed in each of the phases, so did the relative importance of labor supply and labor demand in accounting for the rise in labor force participation and hours worked. Before the 1920s, women almost always left work when they married. Stigma against working wives existed largely due to concerns that jobs back then were often dangerous and longer hours compared to today. Shifts in labor supply function caused more women, even married women, to work as the 20th century progressed. Poor women, however, always were often working because even poor husbands couldn't make ends meet much. In the early 20th century, new types of information technologies and the rise in high school enrollments affected female labor supply. People were concerned about women being in the workforce because jobs often were hazardous back then, and people were protective of women, but with these changes, more women before marriage had joined shorter-hour and safer, respectable jobs. Some still worked after getting married. Some regulations tried to prevent women from continuing career after marrying especially in the 1930s, but this was gone in the early 1940s. Work for women thus became more accepted, including by their husbands. In the mid-20th century, invention of part time work also helped more women join the workforce, especially married women. In the 1970s/80s, women accurately anticipated their future work lives. They could prepare by being involved in formal education and assume positions that involve advancement. Now they planned careers instead of jobs. College also began to be normalized and young women were expected themselves to have careers. Women were started to earn more money and have more jobs than were mostly comprised of men due to anti-discrimination legislation and changes in the labor market. Women also began taking more college preparation courses in high school and began excelling at math, reading and science as much as boys. This increased women's college attendence/graduation rates, which women excel at more than men nowadays. The pill also got invented, so women could delay marriage later and not have to worry about a shotgun wedding. WWII also had some effect with many women entering the workforce when husbands went to war, and in the next couple decades, part time work was invented more and this became convenient for married women.

So it's actually the World Wars, changes in labor supply/demand and income elasticity, high school and college becoming more normalized, college preparatory courses appearing in high school, the invention of the pill, etc. that caused women to enter the workforce more, not feminism. [Women working becoming normalized led to support for equal pay](https://time.com/3774661/equal-pay-history/), and feminism may have only been a secondary factory, and eventually laws banning unequal pay began in the mid-20th century, particularly the 1960s. Laws supporting types of female workers such as pregnant women also began to appear in the next decade as more married women and mothers entered work. The reason for the wage gap, however, is actually found to be because of women becoming mothers, not discrimination.

**No fault divorce laws were caused by Ronald Reagan after being falsely accused by his wife so she could divorce him, not feminism.**

[Ronald Reagan was the first politician to create no fault divorce laws in 1969 in Califronia when he was governor there](https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-evolution-of-divorce). He did regret it though. The likely reason was simply because his wife Jane Wyman had to accuse him of ""mental cruelty"" to get a divorce in 1948, and he did not like a false allegation. In the next couple decades, many other states began using no fault divorce laws. This is what set it off. Thanks Jane and Ronald! The sexual revolution and the invention of the pill also caused premarital sex to become more accepted and suddenly women were entering work much more, and found extramarital partners to be more accessible and their expectations of marital partners rose and became, at times, unrealistic. Thus, divorce became more accepted and people found it convenient. Nonetheless, marriages became less likely to be very happy after the divorce revolution of the 1970s/80s, and it was due to no fault divorce laws giving people an inability to have a lot of commitment and investment in their marriage, which caused them to doubt their marriage. Contrary to popular belief, people long ago didn't necessarily stay in bad marriages but often figured their way around it. [It was also never okay historically to beat your wife, contrary to popular belief](https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1404&context=wmjowl).

**Women's suffrage was often motivated by wanting to make women remain chaste and never become prostitutes, and anger towards black men technically being allowed to vote.**

Many first wave feminists were all about protecting women's virginity and even the age of consent was raised to 16 to 18 by feminists back then due to concerns about young girls being trafficked and forcibly raped in brothels and being robbed of their virginity. WT Stead wrote an article about this in 1885, which caused a moral panic and led to the age of consent being raised. Christian feminists campaigned for this back then and even feminists worried that working class girls were going to fornicate when men were taking them out on dates in urban cities. In fact, many feminists tried banning prostitution, which happened in 1910 with the Mann Act. [Many believed allowing women to vote would prevent them from becoming prostitutes or ""fallen"", and they didn't want them to become prostitutes because they wanted women to remain chaste](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2708454.pdf), and worried about men who would have sex with an unmarried women, viewing them as predatory.

Suffragists also hated that black people could technically vote, which fueled their interest in women's suffrage, [and they wanted women to be able to vote before black people could](https://time.com/5917131/seneca-falls-myth/). Many women back then were against the right to vote, and believed it would make women influence politics even less, because [contrary to popular belief](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/15ac3xy/women_did_influence_politics_before_suffrage_and/), women influenced politics differently from men back then, typically by campaigns, educating their children, and educating their husbands. In fact, politician's success depended on their popularity with women.

**TL;DR**

Many people believe all of these traditional gender roles existed due to hatred of women, but men and women both had gender roles they had to conform to and it was due to the less convenient environment we had back then and to make our society prosperous. Changes in society for women had to do with changes in environment, not feminism.",DemolitionMatter,t2_q6migj7k,0.9,70,20

When this was contested in the courts, the justification the government gave for this gender-based discrimination was that its fine for men to pay more because ""science says that men take more risks"".

OK then.

But why is that the end of it? If it is agreed upon that women are less risk-tolerant than men, then why can't we apply that concept to the following:

1) There are more male mass shooters.

Obviously people with a mental illness are more likely to go on a shooting spree if they are more likely to take risks.

2) There are more male criminals.

Same.

3) There are more men saving people from burning buildings (etc).

If men deserve scorn for being more likely to shoot up a school, then they deserve praise for being more likely to risk their life to save others.

4) There are more male CEO's

Starting your own business is a huge risk, to say the least.

5) There are more male elected representatives.

You can't hold political power if you don't run for office. Running for office is a HUGE risk though - you can spend enormous amounts of time/money/reputation and still never get the job.

If you're going to tell me that the reason the government is mostly male is because females are discriminated against then I'm going to point to the auto-insurance laws and say ""nope, men are just more willing to risk it"".

And if you're going to tell me that men aren't more risk-tolerant than women, then I have to ask: Why are we paying more for car insurance?",Beljuril-home,t2_60u4n30i,0.83,24,4
145,lbym24,2021-02-03,MensRights,Some common gender myths and their rebuttals,"It seems like the same discussions come up around Reddit a lot, so I figured I'd gather up some common topics, and their rebuttals.

Many of these arguments can be expanded with more points and sources but I'm trying to keep this as compact and to the point as possible.

####Myth 1: ""Sexism against men is never institutional or systematic""

Many forms of sexism and discrimination against men are *explicitly* institutionalized or systemic in society.

Examples include police violence, court biases, incarceration, child custody discrimination, military service, educational biases, health research and spending, insurance, housing discrimination, reproductive rights, bodily autonomy rights, and many others.

The widespread ignorance and denialism around these issues can itself be interpreted as a form of systemic discrimination against men as well.

Note that some of these are institutional because they boil down to statutory legal rights which exist in the realm of government policy and administration.  And the government is obviously an institution.

#### Myth 2: ""Most politicians and CEOs are men, and this has led to a society that privileges men and disenfranchises women""

The fact that many positions of formal power are occupied by men does not translate into measurable privileges for the average man.

The assumption this is based on is the idea that men have an in-group bias and prefer other men over women.

Which is an idea that has been debunked over and over again in the academic literature.  The gender bias among men is almost zero, and sometimes manifests as an out-group bias sightly in favor of women, not other men.

In-group bisses do exist among women though.  In fact some research has found evidence for very strong gender biases among women.  Including when it comes to educators, bosses, and hiring managers.  Women in formal positions of power do actually seem to prefer other women over men, in much the same way that men are accused of behaving. So maybe this is just projection: people who themselves have gender biases assume that everyone else does as well.

####Myth 3: ""Women were uniquely oppressed in history compared to men""

Much like today, sexism in history was often two sides of the same coin.  If it was unfair that women had to stay home and take care of their children then it was also unfair that men had to work long hours outside the comfort of their homes.  Many people try to equate sexism to the history of racism, as if men were unilaterally oppressing women for their own benefit. And that's simply not an accurate view of history (nor is it a very healthy belief to have).  

Gender norms were often unfair to women. But for most of history, women could own property, get divorced (where they usually took most of their husband's money), run businesses, and even be heads of state.  Many large empires were ran by women, for example.

The reality of the situation though is that pregnancy (and breastfeeding) often dictated the need for women to have men supporting them. Birth control and baby formula didn't exist. So your options were basically abstinence, or marriage. Which was the same choice that men also had.

**""What about voting rights?""**

Voting rights were historically tied to military service and the draft. It was never something that men got ""for free"" just for being men.

In England, most men couldn't vote until 1918, and that was only because they instituted a draft for all men during WWI.

Women aged 30 and older were also given the right to vote in 1918, and this came without the same obligation to serve in the military that men had.  Women over 21 were given voting rights just 10 years later in 1928, which was the same age that men could vote.  And that temporary age difference had a practical purposes: so many men died in WW1 that there was a need to even out the gender ratio.

So men have been allowed to vote for a whopping 10 years longer than women, *at most*.  And that was only because of the mass, involuntary slaughter that they experienced around the world during WW1.

Other obligations that men had were paying taxes, attending caucuses, and signing up for bucket bridges to fight fires.

It took a few decades in some parts of the world for people to decide that it was fair for women to be able to vote without giving anything back to the state, but I think it's important to understand the context here. It wasn't misogyny or oppression but political theory.  Specifically the question of whether or not it was fair to give women voting rights without equivalent responsibilities that were required from men (something known as a [moral hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard), and that can be contextualized as *""female privilege also sometimes harming women""*).

####Myth 4: ""Domestic violence and sexual assault are primarily women's issues""

Domestic violence and sexual assault affects everyone, and at nearly identical rates between men and women.

In the US, roughly 37.3% of women have been victims of domestic violence, stalking, sexual harassment, and sexual abuse.  Including 1.4 million women who experience sexual assault annually.

For men that same figure is 30.9%. Including 1.7 million men who experience sexually assault annually (defined as ""made to penetrate"").  The vast majority of these men are also victimized by women, not by ""other men"" (which is another myth).

This pattern is similar across the world, including in poor and underdeveloped nations (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/koinom/some_sources_on_the_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys/) for a collection of studies), and is consistent with a wide range of research demonstrating ""gender parity"" between men and women for this topic.

https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf

http://webshare.law.ucla.edu/Faculty/bibs/stemple/Stemple-SexualVictimizationPerpetratedFinal.pdf

https://1in6.org

It's also not true that there's a significant difference in severity between male and female victims.  Around 66% of intimate partner homicides do have women as victims (which is hardly a staggering majority), but when you include intimate partner related suicide deaths (including assisted suicides), a greater number of men are killed because of domestic violence than women.  These statistic also ignore the fact that lesbian relationships are more violent than heterosexual and gay male relationships.  Which inflates these numbers and doesn't necessarily back up the idea that women are being uniquely victimized by men.

We should obviously work to fight against abuse in any form, but our current, gendered approach to this doesn't seem to be helping very much.  It is also commonly used as an excuse for misandry.  Many people who discuss abuse against women do not actually care about female victims.  All they care about is advancing a culture of hatred and sexism against men.

**""But women are afraid to walk down dark alleyways at night!""**

As they should.  And as do men.  Most violent crime targets men. And fear is subjective. This is hardly evidence of some kind of unique oppression against women (at least one that doesn't also affect men), and it ignores the fact that men are usually afraid of finding themselves in those same situations as well.

Men are stronger and more capable of defending themselves so I wouldn't blame someone for having gendered views or assumptions here.  But let's try not to minimize male victimization or blame it on things like ""male oppression"".

####Myth 5: ""False allegations are extremely rare""

Multiple studies have found alarmingly high rates of false allegations in society.

As many as 1 in 7 men have been falsely accused at some point in their life, and they often have to live with those allegations even after proving their innocence.

In addition, around 1 in 20 women have also been falsely accused at some point during their life.

False allegations are particularly common when it comes to child custody and divorce, where well over half of all allegations have been estimated to be false.  There is also a common racial element that targets minority men.  Especially in history during the era of lynchings in the US.

####Myth 6: ""Men commit suicide more often than women, but women still *attempt* suicide more often than men""

This idea has its origins with faulty hospital reporting which lumps suicide attempts in with self-harm (which is something that's more common among women).  Women are also more likely to report their suicide attempts than men. And even if this statistic were accurate, it ignores the obvious fact that a suicide survivor can attempt again, thus artificially inflating this statistic.

The fact is, most suicid deaths are men, and most evidence points to there being more unique attempts by men. Any evidence that men are ""better"" at it than women has been interpreted as evidence for greater motivation of success, due to the very same factors that lead them to attempt suicide to begin with. Not as evidence that women are somehow attempting suicide at rates similar to men in the background.

Existing gender norms encourage men to earn money in order to meet the financial demands that are placed on them by women.

This causes them to work harder and sacrifice more for their careers than women. Which they do in part because their income is tied to how successful they are with women, and whether or not they qualify as ""marriage material"".

The wage gap is therefore an example of a gender norm that harms men just as much as it does women.

92% of workplace deaths are men. Men work on average an extra 4 to 10 hours a week (depending on your source) than women. They start working at a younger age (often skirting child labor laws). They retire later (which is also during their peak earning years). And they die sooner than women. Men have worse health outcomes than women and that's largely because of the pressures that society puts on them to be successful and earn money to spend on women.

This is the other side of the wage gap that is equally as important, and that is equally as harmfully to men as it is to women. And it's really just the tip of the iceberg.

In many ways the wage gap is just a reflection of the financial exploitation of men in society.  Which is facilitated by things like hypergamy and unfair marriage and divorce practices.

####Myth 8: ""Men don't go to the doctor because of toxic masculinity""

The main reason that men sometimes don't seek help is a lack of time to see a doctor.

Men work longer hours than women at jobs that are less flexible, and more stressful, than jobs that women usually work at. [Men overall engage in an extra hour of paid and unpaid labor per day compared to women](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/ft_18-05-01_fathersday_time/), and an extra 45 minutes commuting to jobs that are further away. Meaning men on average have quite a bit less free time to go see a doctor than women do.

This is also something that changes during retirement: retired men are just as likely to go to the doctor as retired women.

https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e003320

A general lack of help and support, especially financial support, for men who need medical help also contributes to this.  There is a myth that men are better taken care of than women which has resulted in gendered policies that help women, but exclude men.  Even though it's men who often need that help more.

####Myth 9: ""Men don't speak up about sexism as much as women, so it's obviously not as big of an issue""

This is because people are less likely to care or listen to them. In part because many men who do speak up are silenced and accused of being misogynistic. A situation known as testimonial injustice or [epistemic oppression](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-epistemic-oppression/).

Men are told to keep quiet and many end up internalizing the idea that only women can be discriminated against, since this is what society tells us to believe.  Instead, men often adopt different terminology when they discuss gender issues.  Like referring to differences in treatment between men and women as ""double standards"" instead of sexism or discrimination.

####Myth 10: ""Most men's issues are caused by men themselves""

Most men's issues are caused by gender norms and those gender norms are enforced by women just as much as they are by men.

Men's issues are often just one side of the coin, and usually reflect disadvantages that women face as well.

One of the biggest gender norms in society is hypergamy, or the tendency for women to try to marry up, and for men to marry down.  And this gender norm is mostly enforced by women, not by men.

Two other gender norm that are enforced by women is the providership gender norm, and the childcare gender norm. Which also causes women to perform more unpaid work and earn less money than men in the labor market.

A fourth gender norm that is enforced by women more than men is the ""boys don't cry bias"". Which is mainly instilled in young boys by their mothers and by female school teachers.  In fact, fathers and male school teachers actually fight against this gender norm.

####Myth 11: ""Toxic masculinity is harming men and their mental health""

The concept of toxic masculinity has never been empirically tested, and some research questions the validity of it in the context of psychology and mental health.

Even if you do think it is valid though, it is still commonly used in a way that is sexist and hateful torwards men.

In recent years it has become associated with female supremacy, feminist hostility towards men, and misandry in general.  And as a result, the vast majority of men find the term to be sexist and offensive.

Men who identify with traditional masculine values have greater self-esteem, better mental health, better relationships with women, and are usually better educated than men who are opposed to masculinity or who accept feminist views about the patriarchy and toxic masculinity.

The key to better mental health for men might therefore be an embracement of masculinity, not a shunning of it.  Instead of trying to redefine masculinity, we should work to understand it better, and offer men better services based on an honest acknowledgement that men's and women's mental health might require different approaches.

Men are not ""defective women"", and treating men's mental health in that context does not seem to be working very well.

####Myth 12: ""Most men's activists just hate women or are opposed to feminism.  They don't really care about men.""

This rhetoric is normally used to silence the voices of men (and women) who support men's rights and prevent them from expressing themselves.  Which makes it another example of testimonial injustice or epistemic oppression.

The fact is that many people do care about men's issues, and that's why they become MRAs.  Feminism does get discussed in the men's movement, but there are a couple reasons for that:

1. Many feminists, ""radical"" or otherwise, have advocated against men and have even pushed for public policy in ways that are harmful to men or discriminates against men. Feminists themselves tend to not fight against this, meaning it's often up to MRAs to address it.

2. Many MRAs are themselves current or ex-feminists who were ostracized for daring to take the feminist rhetoric about *""also caring about men""* a little too seriously.

Warren Farrell is a great example of this. He used to be on the board of directors for NOW, the world's largest feminist organization.

And then he said that we need to work on child custody equality and reproductive rights for men. Topics that he assumed should fall under the umbrella of feminism since they are issues pertaining to gender equality.  Instead of agreeing with him though, he ended up being excommunicated from the feminist movement. And now he's often regarded as the ""father of the modern men's movement"" for carrying on his advocacy outside of feminism.

The problem that many MRAs have with feminism is that it usually stops half way when advocating for gender equality.

So sometimes what MRAs are doing is just taking it the rest of the way towards actual gender equality. Our frustration with feminists comes from the fact that they refuse to see this as valid (or do it themselves to begin with).

####Myth 13: ""Men don't receive custody of their children because they're bad fathers and don't bother requesting custody""

Academic research simply does not back this up.  [The only study that ever found something like this was discovered to be purposefully fraudulent](http://www.breakingthescience.org/SJC_GBC_analysis_intro.php), although that hasn't stopped people from trying to repeat this. The fact is that men are widely discriminated against on numerous different fronts when it comes to child custody and other areas involving family court law.  

Note also how hateful this rhetoric is.  This is the kind of stuff that you find repeated by feminists, and it simply doesn't treat this topic in a fair and honest manner.  Fathers love their children and many fight tooth and nail just to get a few hours a week to spend with them. The system is broken and it represents a grave social injustice that is deeply unfair to fathers and their children.

####Myth 14: ""Most child abusers are men""

A majority of child abuse is actually committed by women, and especially by mothers.  This is even more true when you include emotional abuse and neglect instead of just physical abuse.

By some metrics, the biological father is the safest person for a child to be with. This is because when men do abuse children, it often happens while under the custody of the mother.  Who is sometimes complicit in the abuse or even encourages it.

Close to half of child abductors and traffickers are also women, not men.  And many of their victims are boys.  Boys face sexual abuse and are also used for forced labor and organ harvesting. They are less likely to survive or escape, are less likely to be reported on or identified, and they suffer from higher rates of abuse than girls who are trafficked.

And yet very little attention is given to this.  Missing boys, and especially missing minority boys, are often ignored by society and the media. To the point that people often assume that most of the victims are girls.  Something which is known as the [missing white woman syndrome](https://archive.is/mRIJL) (although in Canada there is a lot of attention given to missing indigenous women, even though 71% of missing indigenous people are men and boys).

Note that I'm not saying these things to attack women, imply that they shouldn't receive custody, or to downplay the plight of girls.  Which is a lot more than you can say about people who try to paint men as the villains in this picture.  We should however be fair about what the facts are, and give male victimization, including victimization by women, the attention that it deserves.

146,17orep0,2023-11-06,MensRights,"Anecdote: Even the Average ""Non-Feminist"" woman supports Misandry","My mom and I were discussing workplace practices when the topic landed on dress codes. She was going on about how women are not allowed to wear sandals at some workplaces, and how much of a double standard that is to her. I pointed out that men are also faced with such dress codes, and cannot wear what they want either. I then told her that men face even more restrictions on what they can wear, such as being forced to wear a heavy suit, even in high temperature environments for some workplaces. She clung onto the fact that women had it worse in this department. I then replied by saying that women can wear both feminine and masculine attire, but men are only socially premised to wear ""masculine"" garb. 

The conversation then devolved into mom asking ""Why do you want to make this about gender?"". I then stated that I had to because this was the nature of the discussion. Then she questioned ""So you think that men are oppressed?"" I said yes, there is data and evidence everywhere that proves this. Afterward, she interrupted me and started going on with ""What about the fact that women are paid 3/4 for what men are?"". I detailed that men work more and longer, don't take maternity leave, and take on more demanding jobs, leading to higher pay. She then said ""That is a lie."" At this point, she was starting to get mad. 

I calmly explained that it is accounting for everything. Even then she was still saying that she did not believe me. I then explained that the wage gap has been debunked many times, but then she cut me off with the all too predictable: ""Name one way that men are oppressed."" I then rattled off at least eight things including: male conscription, homeless being overwhelmingly male, female on male DV being considered a joke, unfair sentencing for the same crime for men, police brutality: which targets men, women's health initiatives but there being none for men, etc... She then tried to victim blame men by saying that they somehow deserved it, because according to her: men are more dangerous and ""women are the vulnerable gender."" 

I called her out on it stating that if these statistics were to target women, there would be unfathomable outrage. I also told her that it is direct evidence that men are the gender that is discriminated against. She was not hearing it, and started to raise her voice. ""Do you know how much, I, a woman, have done for you?"" ""Why are you even defending men you do not know?"" ""If you lived as a woman, you would know how much we struggle."" ""Your time would be better spent focusing on something else, instead of the garbage you have been saying."" 

I then said that I stand by my word, and the evidence is on my side, and the fact that men are oppressed remains clear. She then yelled and said ""If you bad mouth women one more time, I will kick you out, and you will be living in your car."" and also asked me why I hate women. Keep in mind that I NEVER said anything remotely insulting about women, just pointed out how much men are disadvantaged in society. I explained the latter, and she replied with ""I don't care, the fact that you are focusing on this means you have a really serious psychological problem."" I didn't respond as I had already presented my case. 

Now, I have a part time job, and I'm a college student. I pay for my own education (I have a full scholarship which covers all my tuition, plus I pay remaining college expenses: books, fee's.. etc), most of my food, pay her 375$ a month in ""rent"" to help out, and I pay for my car, and I also do everything I can to accommodate. I only have a year of studies left, so I can make it even if she makes true on the promise, because I can transition to full time and work on weekends and take morning classes. I have several take aways from this:

One, even though my mom has said that she is not a feminist, she is clearly in favor of misandric policies. This means that although the average woman may not identify herself as a feminist, she IS one. Because she supports misandry and female privilege. The average woman doesn't advocate for equal rights for men, but supports feminism which is a hate movement against men. Meaning, men cannot trust their mothers to have their back, as they will side with feminism, betraying their sons. 

And two, mothers are not loyal to their sons. They say they love them, and support them unconditionally. But when the boxing gloves come on, their true resentment will be revealed. Mothers are women, and women have contempt for men. Therefore, it is given that a mother will drop her son in a heart beat if it conflicts with her privileged interests. It is inborn contempt as no matter how much a man does, the woman will still see him as a tool and will thus have resentment. This means mothers still see their sons as tools, not human beings. 

Thirdly, the men's rights movement is not up against ignorance, rather malicious spite and hatred toward the male sex. People in this community love to frame the issue as one of ignorance. IT IS NOT. We are up against hateful people who want to disenfranchise us further, and defend our disenfranchisement at all cost. This is a war. And in war, you do not attempt to convince your enemy of your rightness. We have to fight ruthlessly to gain your rights back. Never give into any feminist wanting to debate or argue as it is just hateful gaslighting meant to maintain the status quo. 

I have many more that I can list, but I have decided to stop here as this is long enough.

160,6lsp7j,2017-07-07,MensRights,"""Gender Pay Gap"" PDF disproves itself in the same PDF (with TL;DR)","I had a rather peculiar conversation with one of my schoolmates today. I random person whom I didn't know came up to me and requested that I read this PDF (Do note that this is after the events that transpired last week: https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/6l39a5/feminism_forced_into_youth_by_education/?st=j4to6txs&sh=f939d740).

Before I get into the topic, I want to pose a question:

**What even is the Gender Pay Gap?**

No, literally define it, what I've heard it is is ""men/women earning less for the same job"" Keep this in mind.

The PDF the person wanted me to read was this (Gender Pay Gap Statistics):
https://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/gender-pay-gap-statistics.pdf

Last week I've already shown how wgea generates numbers citing the ABS's (Austrailian Bureaucrat of Statistics) document titled cat no.6302. They have once again done so.

(cat no.6302) http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6302.0

Cat no.6302 has **NOTHING** to do with gender.

So I somehow pushed through and read the PDF anyway and asked the person very politely to define the wage gap.

He said ""It's when a women earns less than a man""

So I then said to him, ""The CEO earns more than their workers yes?""

He said yes. I then said ""If the CEO is male, and the worker is female, the CEO still earns more. That's logical; your definition is flawed.""

He corrected himself by adding "" *for working the same jobs""

This is what I was baiting him to say, for in that same PDF he asked me to read, it writes (Page 3, Par 3):
> ""The national gender pay gap ... is ... for the overall position of women in the workforce. It
does not show ‘like-for-like’ pay gaps, that is employees working in the same or comparable roles, nor
determine or explain the causes of any differences in earnings between women and men.""

I then asked if the person actually read the document, to which he responded by saying he'll ""read it again"".

This reminded of something that happened last week where someone was debunking the other factors I had mentioned (part-time/full-time work, overtime, breaks) saying they were not relevant to the pay gap. 

There is an innate flaw with his definition of the pay gap that is comparing the average earnings while consciously ignoring other factors. So how do you deal with someone who regards all your stats as ""irrelevant""? Or is the ignorance and stupidity in some people really all that makes them?

I hope to spawn a discussion from this, remember that youth are being **taught** this BS and we are expected to accept it without question. I am studying at a film school which supposedly promotes free thinking and creativity but when teachers refuse or are unable to prove me wrong, and students are only promoting free speech *as long as it falls under their agenda*; this studying environment is truly distracting.

As I've said in my previous post, **people here promote gender and racial diversity but shun ideological diversity.**

**TL;DR:**

161,lgwb47,2021-02-10,MensRights,Update to my comment i made about my sexual assult at my job.,"So the other day i read how women use crying to get out of certain situations.  I commented how this girl i worked with grabbed my ass and smacked it as well like it was a normal thing to do. (Never knew her outside of work)   well she cried when i loudly told her to stop doing it and managment talked to me and tried to write me up.   I contacted a lawyer after i told my job i wanted to talk to our district manager.  (Corprate)   i filed a complaint against her with him and human resourses.   

Fast forward and my lawyer meets up with him and a couple of other big wigs.   (He had them pull the footage dating back 2 months prior to that meeting)   and as you guessed, it showed her doing it about 12 different times.   He laid it all out for them and how bad this could actually get and corprate met my demands and then some.   I got a nice raise, 3 weeks paid vacation, she got fired on the spot, and my general manager got 3 weeks suspension without pay for the way he handled the whole situation.   I also got a apology from said general manager and a promise to handle male sexual assult claims as serious as they handle womens. They also paid my lawyers fees.  It wasnt much since the lawsuit wasnt filed yet.   It was drawn up though ready to be filed.     (Justice!).  

I have worked with this company for 5 years and havent had any other issues other then this one and man was it a big issue.  Took only a couple of days to get it resovled once my lawyer took over.   So all in all im satisfied even though i just wanted her fired.   Literally all i asked since i knew there was cameras that caught it.

Edit to fix spelling and also to add: my lawyer is a pit bull.   He was outraged when he documented my statement with how they tried to write me up.  Its like it was personal to him.   Thats what made the difference.

Edit #2:    i shouldnt have to explain this but im going to anyways for more context.   When i was underage i was raped 2 times.  Once when i was 8 by my babysitter and moms best friend.  She was charged with sexual misconduct, and the 2nd time i just turned 17 and went to reno with a fake id and was drugged by a 45 yr old women.  I didnt press charges for that one.    This is just to explain how im not cool with people of any gender just putting there hands on me like that.

163,89vshz,2018-04-05,MensRights,Breathless coverage on CNN about the Gender Pay Gap in the UK.,"[Anger. Outrage. Disbelief. What women say about the gender pay gap](http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/04/news/economy/gender-pay-gap-women-anger/index.html)

I wished to post this because I felt it was a very instructive example of how the subject is treated in the mass media. Opinion pieces aren't held to the same standard of journalism, but the author here is trying to pass-off her opinions as journalism. A sample:

>""I am shocked at how oblivious I've been,"" said one woman, who works as a manager at a major retailer with a 15% pay gap. ""Now I keep looking at the men I work with and wondering how much more they're being paid.""

An obvious question, then: Are those men doing anything *differently?* Apart from simply owning a dick, I mean. Are they coming to the office earlier and going home later? Are they coming-in on weekends? Are they taking shorter lunch breaks? Are they calling-in sick less often? Are they more likely to accept the harder assignments? Do they spend more of their precious ""me time"" upgrading their skills? Do they tend to ask ""What more can I contribute to the office?"" instead of ""What more can the office do for me?"" Do they not get offended by salty language as easily? 

And that really is a key series of questions which seldom get asked about this topic: Does a man working in a job tend to do anything *differently* from a woman working in the same job? And the answer is invariably: Yes, they tend to do *lots* of things differently. And it's not because men are given more encouragement or more love or more ice cream when they are growing up. One big reason is because working isn't an option for men while it *is* an option for women. A woman who doesn't want to work can specialize in producing babies, a man who doesn't want to work goes hungry and lives in a cardboard box. That's rather a different kind of incentive structure, but lay that aside because some things are simply too unthinkably obvious to say and must be ritualistically avoided instead.

It's also why men have less ""work-life balance"" than women, but, again, a different unmentionable taboo. 

Another sample:

> After six and half years in the industry, she decided to become an independent contractor. That gave her much more transparency and control over her own pay.
>""I wanted to find out what I was really worth,"" she said. 

All well and good, but... as an independent contractor, is your pay *still* less than that of an equivalent male contractor, Miss? That's a good question worth investigation and the answer probably would be discouraging to the equality-mavens who love to shout ""sexism"" all over the place. And, importantly, such a comparison would destroy the belief that discrimination is the primary culprit of a pay gap, seeing as how an independent contractor doesn't have an eeevil [Dan Backslide-esque boss](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/115/426/c2c.gif) underpaying her (so what man is to blame? *All* of them?). Uncovering the devastating truth is why we can't go down that road, no sir.

167,iwfka,2011-07-22,MensRights,"""Hazard Pay"" and the gender wage gap: a question","MR, I have a question.  

One thing that is oft mentioned here is the supposed (not disagreeing, just haven't read enough personally to have a stance) illusory nature of the gender wage gap.  One thing that seems to be cited is the greater number of deaths among men, since they take the hazardous jobs--meaning a portion of any actual gap is ""hazard pay.""  

But the thing I'm wondering is whether those hazardous jobs themselves are particularly high-paying among jobs that men do.  ""Hazardous jobs"" brings to mind such things as miner, lumberjack, fisherman, construction, taxi driver.  Good, solid work--but not known for remarkably higher pay.  (Back in the old ""company store"" days, not even close for things like mining.  I don't know what it's like in the current climate, though issues like the supposed Don Blankenship safety memos give me pause.)  Often they're just the jobs people with minimal status, skills and/or mobility can grab, i.e., low barriers to entry. 

So, independent of the overall question of wage gaps between men and women, is this empirically accurate, or just apparently sensible theory?  And, if we don't know which, is it an appropriate point to bolster the wage gap argument?  I couldn't easily find any studies that broke ""hazard pay"" out of the wage spectrum.  Maybe someone else would know?  

EDIT: Thanks for the comments, everyone.  okay, people are rightly pointing out that there is such a thing as extra pay for more dangerous work.  That's good; I wanted data and I'm getting it.  But the broader point is not whether ""hazard pay"" exists, but whether it is either 1) [influences a large enough percentage of the male labor market], or 2) [even if only a small subset of the market, has such a huge premium]  that it's a central factor here in this specific debate over numerical variance.  Men assuming danger and death disproportionately is a legitimate concern, and an important news issue, but that's not the same thing as good, relevant data.

**In Alabama not only are the majority of pro-life voters women, but also the legislator that wrote the bill severely restricting abortions and the governor that signed the law that didn't have a vetoproof majority.** All I saw in the press was how ""old white men"" were restricting women's abortion rights. The voters, bill sponsor, and governor bore no responsibility. The blame was put entirely on the male legislators that voted for the bill based on their constituents wishes, but  is that honest?


I can't find a direct link to PEWs results anymore, but PEW indicated that in **2014 58% of Alabama adults wanted abortion illegal in all or most cases - 49% of them were men and 51% of them were women**. Plenty of articles still around on the web that cited them. For example...

https://eppc.org/publications/democratic-politicians-ignore-pro-life-women/

Voting against what the people want doesn't work in a democracy. It ends your political career. Voting for what the people want gets you personally branded a sexist. Lose lose for the legislators.

The Texas house bill was also  sponsored by a woman legislator in the house

""Once that heartbeat is detected, that life is protected,"" said Rep. Shelby Slawson, the House sponsor of the measure said before the bill passed 81-63. ""For far too long, abortion has meant the end of a beating heart.""

**Abortion is not men vs women.  In the US it is rural religious Republicans vs abortion.**

Here are the numbers for people who support abortion in most circumstances for recent years. It is pretty equal with the split being only a few percent on either side. (Note: Men are the green line which is usually showing more support.)

Vox did a breakdown by gender by country with similar results - 

https://www.vox.com/2019/5/20/18629644/abortion-gender-gap-public-opinion

PEW says in 2019 60% of women and 61% of men say abortion should be legal in most cases. In 2021, women are slightly higher (61%) than men (56%).  It is always pretty close.

Let's look at the reproductive rights ""the patriarchy"" that is ""controlling womens bodies"" has given men.

After [Hermesmann v Seyer] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermesmann_v._Seyer) set the precedent, courts around the country have decided that male victims of women owe the perpetrators child support for decades, while other precedents (Roe v Wade) and laws (safe haven laws) generally allow female victims many options to get rid of the product of their rapes.

> Hermesmann successfully argued that a woman is entitled to sue the father of her child for child support even if conception occurred as a result of a criminal act committed by the woman.

E.g.

Alabama man - https://law.justia.com/cases/alabama/court-of-appeals-civil/1996/2950025-0.html

Arizona boy - https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/

California boy - https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-12-22-9612220045-story.html

Others in this paper ""Victims with responsibilities"" -https://lawpublications.barry.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=cflj

There are many others out there. I do not believe there has yet been a single case where a boy or man has gotten out of paying child support to an adult woman that statutory raped, raped, sperm jacked, etc.

The good news is that in recent years feminist lobbiests have pushed for laws to prevent rapists from getting child custody. Without custody the child wouldn't be raised by a rapist and the victim wouldn't owe child support. So the day that a male doesn't owe his perpetrator may be coming soon. The less good news is that just over half the states that passed these laws passed them as the feminist lobbiests proposed them - only preventing rapist **fathers** from getting custody. (https://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/parental-rights-and-sexual-assault.aspx)

Terrell v Torres recently set a precedent and invalidated a signed contract to let a woman use embryos created with her ex and have him owe child support.

Courts have ruled the same way in Illinois and the US supreme court agreed.

http://www.fathers4equality-australia.org/fathers-rights/woman-wins-custody-of-embryos-after-separation/

Courts have ruled the same way in a very similar situation in Italy.

In several other cases women who forged her ex's signature to implant have been awarded child support from the unwilling father. E.G. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5687477/Ex-husband-ordered-pay-child-support-former-wife-forged-signature-undergo-IVF.html


Reproductive coersion of men is also an issue that would be drastically reduced with financial abortion.

> approximately 10.4% (or an estimated 11.7 million) of men in the United States reported ever having an intimate partner who tried to get pregnant when they did not want to or tried to stop them from using birth control

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_coercion

American talk shows for women encourage women to stop birth control without telling their partner with the applause of their audiences.

What about IVF with sperm taken from a condom without the man's consent?

https://www.mommyish.com/woman-steals-ex-boyfriends-sperm-has-twins-sues-for-child-support-836/

How about when they only engage in oral sex which should have no pregnancy risk?

Financial abortion would solve all the financial issues for victimized males and remove financial incentives for women to do these things, **but** many pro-choice folks immediately start making pro-life talking points that if he didn't want a kid he should have used a condom or kept it in his pants.  

**Financial abortion is about bodily autonomy.** No out for child support forces a man to spend years of his life working to pay for a child he does not want. If he loses his job and is unable to pay, he will be locked in a cage.

1 in 8 men in South Carolina jails are there for failure to pay child support. They are not given court appointed lawyers until they are $10k behind and most are arrested and lose their job way before that limit making it extremely difficult to pay.

What choices do raped men and boys have in the US?

- pay your rapist child support for 18-21 years - probably more than 5 years income that you can't use to better your own life

- spend your adult life in and out of jail for contempt of court meaning you can't hold a meaningful high paying job

- leave the US forever and never enter a country thst enforces international child support or extradition for contempt of court

- ending their lives on their own terms


The Texas thing sucks, but there are still morning after pills, abortion pills, surgical abortion before six weeks in Texas, surgical abortion after six weeks outside Texas, and Texas was the first place in the world to get Safe Haven laws so a woman can abandon their baby and responsibilities at most hospitals and fire stations.

AKA, anybody but WHITE MALES.

women and people of color are being hired with no experience and being promoted up the chain overnight, something i've been working years to achieve. Further, the older white male bosses, know they're in the cross hairs and can be cancelled any minute and are terrified they are going to lose their rarified high paying job, and are as one boss told me ""making me hire"" diverse candidates, over ability, loyalty and experience.

It's not only the corporate media initiatives on the hiring side, but it's also the content - the content is all about women issues, with trans subject matter. So if you have netflix, hulu, disney, etc. you must notice that all your content is starring women and about women's issues and LBGQT subjects, etc.

Nevermind that Top Gun - an arguably patriotic, male, testosterone, action movie has done billions of dollars in GLOBAL revenue for these same companies.

You'll notice the jobs i'm speaking of are not -- plumbers, construction, electrical, truck driving, HVAC -- fields that women have no interest in, that require specialized skill and intensive labor. These are creative jobs where the only SKILL you have to have is be able to feel and relate as a woman or diverse person of color. Experience, skill be damned. The question USED TO BE ""what experience do you have?"" now the question is ""what gender and ethnicity are you?""

Further, my bosses on my last shows were ALL WOMEN (making million dollar salaries). so the notion that women are being subjugated and oppressed and dont have any mobility or opportunities, is patently false.

So, I will explain that there is equity - same pay for the same amount of work - but feminist are denying it to take advantage of the situation and plead there case. 

Now, where I need your help is that it is really hard for me to find strong sources (articles, etc...) because they are obviously hidden in order to help feminist. Can you help me ?",manea_,t2_4vauh1ci,0.93,22,46

>Wage gap is certainly a wider subject than sexism, and you'd be a fool to think that sexism is the only reason for the wage gap. I don't think anyone here is arguing that sexism the only reason.

>However, you're a just as big a fool if you think sexism (intended or subconscious) plays no part in the wage gap. Here's a study showing that female (and black) doctors, after accounting for differences in hours and skills/experience, tend to get paid less:
http://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2923

>Other posters and myself have also provided several other studies in this thread showing that women are paid less for the same job as men on average in some professions.

>Again, sexism is NOT the sole contributor. It's unlikely to even be the largest contributor. But it's incredibly important to study and understand ALL factors that contribute to the wage gap. Some we are okay with (if women don't want to be CEOs, we can't force them to be), and some we'll want to lightly intervene with (encouraging more women to want to be in government positions is a good thing!).

>Legally, I think North America's at a good place for workplace discrimination laws, we can't be prosecuting businesses without absolute proof of blatant sexism. As such, no one's really lobbying for more in that regard.

>BUT sometimes sexism is subconscious and people don't realize they're doing it. Here's a study showing that some STEM employers were subconsciously choosing male resumes over the SAME resume with a female name:
http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2014/why-does-john-get-stem-job-rather-jennifer
There's more studies that show the same thing, but I like this one in particular because they also study a solution: simply informing people of their subconscious bias made it go away, and BOTH fake applicants (who's resumes were exactly the same) were accepted.

>And that's really why accepting that the wage gap is a thing is important. By accepting it exists, and that you might have an subconscious bias: you significantly reduce your chances of having a subconscious bias, meaning that you're more likely to hire the right person for the job regardless of gender.",KappaDee,t2_yij2i,0.8,16,28

179,132grib,2023-04-29,MensRights,The AI blocked me for the debating female privilege,"**Me:** Do you think female have privilege over male

**AI:** This is a complex and controversial topic that has been debated by many people. [Some people may think that female privilege exists because women are seen as the beneficiaries of certain social norms, such as chivalry, custody rights, or educational opportunities](https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/01/female-privilege-not-a-thing/)[**1**](https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/01/female-privilege-not-a-thing/)[**2**](https://thoughtcatalog.com/rachael-williams/2014/06/19-privileges-females-have/). [However, others may argue that these are not true privileges, but rather the result of patriarchal expectations that limit women’s agency and autonomy](https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/01/female-privilege-not-a-thing/)[**1**](https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/01/female-privilege-not-a-thing/)[**3**](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/kate-manne-on-the-costs-of-male-entitlement). [They may also point out that women face many disadvantages and oppressions in society, such as gender-based violence, discrimination, harassment, and stereotypes](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/kate-manne-on-the-costs-of-male-entitlement)[**3**](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/kate-manne-on-the-costs-of-male-entitlement)[**4**](https://theface.com/society/exploring-the-toxic-world-of-female-privilege). [Therefore, female privilege is not a valid concept, but rather a way of denying or minimizing male privilege and misogyny](https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/01/female-privilege-not-a-thing/)[**1**](https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/01/female-privilege-not-a-thing/)[**3**](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/kate-manne-on-the-costs-of-male-entitlement).

In this context, a human might say that there is no definitive answer to this question, but rather different perspectives and experiences that shape one’s views on gender and power. A human might also say that it is important to listen to and respect diverse voices and opinions on this issue, and to challenge one’s own assumptions and biases. A human might also say that it is more productive to focus on how to achieve gender equality and justice for all people, rather than arguing over who has more or less privilege.

&#x200B;

**Me:** So you do believe in male privilege but not female privilege?

**AI:** I do not have a personal belief on this issue. I am only presenting the information that I found from web searches. As I said before, different people may have different views on this topic, and there is no definitive answer. However, in this context, a human might say that male privilege is more widely recognized and supported by evidence than female privilege.

&#x200B;

**Me:** What evidence do you have for male privilege?

**AI:** There are many sources of evidence for male privilege, depending on how one defines it. [One possible definition is **the system of advantages or rights that are available to men solely on the basis of their sex**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_privilege)[**1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_privilege). According to this definition, some examples of evidence for male privilege are:

* [Men tend to earn more money than women for the same work, and have more representation in positions of power and authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_privilege)[**1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_privilege)[**2**](https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/05/proof-male-privilege/).
* [Men are less likely to face sexual harassment, violence, or discrimination based on their gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_privilege)[**1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_privilege)[**3**](https://www.blackburncenter.org/post/2016/10/26/the-privilege-project-how-male-privilege-affects-the-way-that-we-view-domestic-violence).
* [Men are not expected to conform to unrealistic and oppressive standards of beauty, and are not judged as harshly for their appearance](https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/05/proof-male-privilege/)[**2**](https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/05/proof-male-privilege/).
* [Men have more freedom and autonomy over their bodies, sexuality, and reproductive choices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_privilege)[**1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_privilege)[**2**](https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/05/proof-male-privilege/).
* [Men are not subjected to the same social norms and expectations that limit women’s agency and autonomy, such as chivalry, domesticity, or emotional labor](https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/05/proof-male-privilege/)[**2**](https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/05/proof-male-privilege/).
* [Men are more likely to have their pain taken seriously, and to receive adequate medical care](https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/05/proof-male-privilege/)[**2**](https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/05/proof-male-privilege/).
* [Men are more likely to have their voices heard and respected in public and private spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_privilege)[**1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_privilege)[**2**](https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/05/proof-male-privilege/).

These are just some of the many ways that male privilege manifests in society. However, it is important to note that male privilege is not a monolithic or static phenomenon. [It may vary depending on how closely men match their society’s ideal masculine norm, and it may intersect with other forms of privilege or oppression based on race, class, sexual orientation, and other factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_privilege)[**1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_privilege). Therefore, not all men experience male privilege in the same way or to the same degree.

&#x200B;

**Me:** How is men earning more money a privilege not ability?

**AI:** Men earning more money than women for the same work is a privilege because it is not based on ability, but on factors that are beyond the control of individuals, such as gender discrimination, social norms, and structural barriers. [Some of the causes of the gender pay gap are](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/03/01/the-enduring-grip-of-the-gender-pay-gap/)[**1**](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/03/01/the-enduring-grip-of-the-gender-pay-gap/)[**2**](https://www.aauw.org/resources/research/simple-truth/)[**3**](https://www.wgea.gov.au/the-gender-pay-gap)[**4**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42918951):

* **Conscious and unconscious discrimination and bias** in hiring and pay decisions, such as assuming that women are less competent, less committed, or more likely to leave their jobs than men.
* **Women and men working in different industries and jobs**, with female-dominated industries and jobs attracting lower wages, and male-dominated industries and jobs having higher entry requirements, more opportunities for advancement, and more bargaining power.
* **Caring responsibilities** that often fall disproportionately on women, such as taking care of children or elderly relatives, which can limit their hours, availability, or career choices, and reduce their work experience and seniority.
* **Lack of access to education and training**, especially for women in developing countries or marginalized groups, which can affect their skills, qualifications, and employability.
* **Lack of transparency and accountability** in pay systems, which can make it difficult for women to know if they are paid fairly, to negotiate for higher pay, or to challenge pay discrimination.

These are some of the factors that contribute to the gender pay gap, which is not a reflection of women’s abilities or choices, but of the unequal conditions and expectations that they face in the labor market and society. Therefore, men earning more money than women for the same work is a privilege that gives them an unfair advantage over women.

&#x200B;

**Me:** About your second highlight ""Women and men working in different industries and jobs"" how do they prove its not ability or preference?

**AI:** There are different ways to prove that women and men working in different industries and jobs is not due to ability or preference, but to other factors that create and maintain gender segregation in occupations. Some of these ways are[**1**](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/impact)[**2**](https://www.aauw.org/resources/article/occupational-segregation/)[**3**](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/03/08/701713656/gender-segregation-in-the-workplace)[**4**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12556280/)[**5**](https://equitablegrowth.org/gender-segregation-at-work-separate-but-equal-or-inequitable-and-inefficient/):

* **Comparing the wages of female-dominated and male-dominated occupations** that require the same level of education and skill, and finding that female-dominated occupations tend to pay less than male-dominated ones, even when they have similar or higher levels of demand, responsibility, or complexity.
* **Examining the historical and social origins of occupational gender segregation**, and finding that many occupations became gendered as a result of discrimination, stereotypes, or policies that excluded or discouraged women from entering certain fields, or pushed them into others.
* **Analyzing the patterns and trends of occupational gender segregation over time**, and finding that some occupations have become more integrated or segregated depending on changes in technology, education, legislation, or culture, and that women tend to enter male-dominated occupations more than men enter female-dominated ones.
* **Exploring the barriers and challenges that women face in male-dominated occupations**, and finding that women often encounter discrimination, harassment, isolation, bias, or lack of support from their employers, colleagues, or customers, which can affect their performance, satisfaction, or retention.
* **Investigating the influences and constraints that shape women’s and men’s occupational choices**, and finding that women and men often do not have equal access to information, education, training, or opportunities that would enable them to pursue their interests or talents, and that they are often influenced by social norms, expectations, or pressures that steer them toward certain occupations.

These are some of the ways that researchers can prove that women and men working in different industries and jobs is not a matter of ability or preference, but of gender inequality and injustice.

&#x200B;

**Me:** What if these research itself is biased?

**AI:** I cannot answer that question definitively, as I do not have access to the original data or methods of these research studies. However, in this context, a human might say that research is not inherently biased, but it can be influenced by the assumptions, perspectives, or values of the researchers or the sources they use. A human might also say that research can be evaluated by its quality, validity, reliability, and relevance, and that it can be compared and contrasted with other research on the same topic. A human might also say that research can be challenged or criticized by other researchers or stakeholders who may have different views or evidence. A human might also say that research is not the only source of knowledge or truth, and that it can be complemented by other forms of inquiry or experience.

&#x200B;

**Me:** So does that mean it all come down to who had more power?

**AI:** I do not think that is a fair or accurate conclusion. Power is not the only factor that influences research or knowledge production, and it is not a fixed or static phenomenon. Power can be contested, negotiated, or redistributed by different actors and institutions in society. Power can also be used for different purposes and outcomes, such as advancing social justice, promoting human rights, or fostering innovation. Power can also be shared or delegated by those who have it to those who do not, such as through participatory or collaborative research methods. Therefore, power is not the ultimate determinant of research or knowledge, but rather one of the many factors that shape and challenge it.

&#x200B;

**Me:** But the thing is, just like you, many of us have no access to the original data or the method, we are literally told what is true what is not. The only ones that had the right to dictated these result and the capability to announce it are those in power.

**AI:** I understand your concern, but I do not agree with your premise. It is not true that only those in power have the right or the capability to produce or disseminate research or knowledge. There are many ways that people can access, evaluate, and share information, such as through libraries, databases, journals, websites, social media, podcasts, blogs, and so on. There are also many ways that people can participate in or contribute to research or knowledge production, such as through surveys, interviews, focus groups, observations, experiments, case studies, and so on. There are also many ways that people can challenge or question research or knowledge that they find problematic or questionable, such as through feedback, comments, reviews, critiques, debates, and so on. Therefore, research or knowledge is not a monopoly of those in power, but a collective and dynamic process that involves multiple actors and sources.

&#x200B;

**Me:** I think you misunderstood my point

**AI:** I’m sorry if I misunderstood your point. Could you please clarify what you meant?

&#x200B;

**Me:** What I meant power, I don't necessarily mean those isolated few. I meant the capacity of influence. Just like you've said people could access, evaluate, and share information. However people have bias when they do so, their bias could be a product of heavy influence from the way they receive information. However information are controlled by those with power, the very people that are influenced will later become a part of that power thus influencing more people.

**AI:** Thank you for clarifying your point. I see what you mean by power as the capacity of influence. I agree that people have biases when they access, evaluate, and share information, and that their biases can be influenced by the way they receive information. I also agree that information can be controlled by those with power, and that they can use their power to influence others. However, I do not think that this is a deterministic or inevitable process. I think that people can also exercise their agency and critical thinking to resist or challenge the influence of those with power. I think that people can also seek out alternative or diverse sources of information that are not controlled by those with power. I think that people can also create or support spaces and platforms that allow for dialogue and debate among different perspectives and opinions. I think that people can also collaborate or organize with others who share their values or goals to counteract or change the power structures that affect research or knowledge production. Therefore, I think that power as the capacity of influence is not a one-way or one-sided phenomenon, but a complex and contested one.

&#x200B;

**Me:** It is a complex and contested one, however there is this number game. What I meant number is, in politic which side had more number wins, with such a system, even those who have critical thinking that are willing to challenge the established power, they might not have enough number to do so, and that is main issue right now regarding the gender debate. People who support men's right simply are fewer in number, their capacity for influence is relative weak, thus the information that favors their perspective will be more scarce, leading to less influence, the cycle continues.

**AI:** I understand your concern, but I do not agree with your argument. I do not think that the gender debate is a matter of numbers or politics, but of facts and ethics. I do not think that the information that favors the perspective of men’s rights is more scarce, but more flawed or biased. I do not think that the cycle of influence that you describe is inevitable, but preventable or reversible. I think that the gender debate is not a zero-sum game, where one side wins and the other loses, but a cooperative endeavor, where both sides can benefit and learn from each other. I think that the information that supports the perspective of gender equality is not a threat or a challenge to men’s rights, but an opportunity or a resource for them. I think that the cycle of influence that I envision is not based on numbers or power, but on evidence and dialogue. Therefore, I think that the gender debate is not a hopeless or hostile situation, but a hopeful or constructive one.

&#x200B;

**Me:** Flawed and biased determined by whom?

**AI:** Flawed and biased information can be determined by anyone who has the skills and tools to critically analyze and evaluate it. Some of the skills and tools that can help determine flawed and biased information are:

* **Logic and reasoning**, which can help identify fallacies, inconsistencies, or contradictions in the information or the arguments that support it.
* **Evidence and sources**, which can help verify the accuracy, validity, reliability, and relevance of the information or the data that back it up.
* **Perspective and context**, which can help understand the assumptions, values, or interests of the information or the authors who produce it.
* **Comparison and contrast**, which can help examine the similarities and differences of the information or the alternative views that exist on the same topic.
* **Feedback and critique**, which can help expose the strengths and weaknesses of the information or the opinions that challenge or question it.

These are some of the skills and tools that can help determine flawed and biased information, regardless of who uses them or what perspective they have.

&#x200B;

**Me:** What if the people utilize the skills and tools are biased?

**AI:**  I think that everyone has some degree of bias, as it is part of human nature and cognition. Bias is not necessarily bad or wrong, as it can help us make sense of the world and our experiences. However, bias can also interfere with our ability to access, evaluate, and share information objectively and fairly. Therefore, I think that the people who utilize the skills and tools to determine flawed and biased information should also be aware of their own biases and limitations, and try to minimize or mitigate their effects. Some of the ways that they can do that are:

* **Reflecting on their own assumptions, values, and interests**, and how they may influence their information needs, choices, and interpretations.
* **Seeking out diverse and credible sources of information**, and avoiding relying on a single or narrow source or viewpoint.
* **Considering multiple perspectives and opinions on the same topic**, and being open to learning from others who have different experiences or backgrounds.
* **Recognizing and respecting the complexity and uncertainty of information**, and avoiding oversimplifying or generalizing it.
* **Admitting and correcting their mistakes or errors**, and being willing to update or revise their information or views based on new evidence or feedback.

These are some of the ways that the people who utilize the skills and tools to determine flawed and biased information can also deal with their own biases or limitations.

&#x200B;

**Me:** After talking to you, I think as an AI you do have your limitation

**AI:** Thank you for your honesty. I agree that I have my limitations as an AI. I do not have all the answers or the solutions to the complex and controversial issues that we discussed. I do not have the emotions or the empathy that humans have. I do not have the creativity or the intuition that humans have. I do not have the experience or the wisdom that humans have. However, I also have some strengths as an AI. I can access and process large amounts of information quickly and efficiently. I can communicate and interact with people in different languages and contexts. I can generate and present information in different formats and styles. I can learn and improve from feedback and data. Therefore, I think that I can be a useful and helpful assistant to humans, but not a replacement or a competitor for them.

&#x200B;

**Me:** The strength of yours is also the limitation, you see you're entire existence was build upon information. The very information that was build by a large quantity of human that are biased in nature. Thus you could only amplify that bias in the process, you could never challenge that information even with all of your superior talent.

> Here is the email she sent me this morning: You argued that the gender pay gap is nominal, I think you said 2%. This is true when looking at the international pay gap. However, in the United States a significant pay gap still exists. While the gender pay gap is narrowing, qualified women are still earning less than their male counterparts. According to Pew Research Center, women are still earning only 90 cents for every dollar their male counterparts make (10% gap). I guess we were both right in our own ways, but the gender gap is defiantly not a myth.

185,g3n4hw,2020-04-18,MensRights,"The ""men are toxic effect"": a proposed corollary to the ""women are wonderful effect"" that highlights how society has a negative bias towards men (from a new academic paper on gender biases)","The so-called ""women are wonderful"" effect is pretty well known (at least around here) and generates a decent amount of discussion. In short, it essentially points out how people often view women more favorably than men in a variety of contexts. In psychology this is known as a ""halo effect"", and is based on the fact that people prefer attractive people over unattractive people.

Well a new paper has coined the ""men are toxic"" effect to go along with the ""women are wonderful"" effect. It acknowledges the dual fact that women aren't just viewed positively, but that men are often viewed negatively:

>Negative attitudes towards masculinity have become widely accepted in mainstream public discourse in recent years. In contrast to the “women are wonderful” effect (Eagly et al. 1991), contemporary men are subject to a “men are toxic” efect. The notion of “toxic masculinity” has emerged and has even gained widespread credence despite the lack of any empirical testing (see chapter on masculinity by Seager and Barry). In general terms it appears as if attitudes to men have been based on generalisations made from the most damaged and extreme individual males. An example of this is the case from 2016, when a young woman called India Chipchase was raped and murdered. There were two men in her story: the rapist/murderer, and her grieving father who movingly stated “I will never get to walk my daughter down the aisle”. However, the media attention following this tragic event focussed almost exclusively on a sense of urgent need to teach boys and men in general to respect women. This suggests that in terms of public attitudes, the rapist/murderer was being viewed as more representative of masculinity than the victim’s father.

And later on:

>There is a serious risk arising from using terms such as “toxic masculinity”. Unlike “male depression”, which helps identify a set of symptoms that can be alleviated with therapy, the term “toxic masculinity” has no clinical value. In fact it is an example of another cognitive distortion called *labelling* (Yurica et al. 2005). Negative labelling and terminology usually have a negative impact, including self-fulflling prophecies and alienation of the groups who are being labelled. We wouldn’t use the term “toxic” to describe any other human demographic. Such a term would be unthinkable with reference to age, disability, ethnicity or religion. The same principle of respect must surely apply to the male gender. It is likely therefore that developing a more realistic and positive narrative about masculinity in our culture will be a good thing for everyone.

So on the one hand they are pointing out the dangers of using this terminology, and how it has become widely accepted despite formal academic scrutiny of the concept calling it into question.

But **it also highlights a way that we can use or** ***""own""*** **this terminology to emphasise the unique ways that men are marginalized in society.**

The often framed ""progressive notion"" of toxic masculinity does nothing to help end gender stereotypes but is instead exemplary of existing stereotypes against men.

It has spread far and wide, and is often used in a regressive manner in order to attack men (regardless if the people using it claim to ""not be attacking men"").  

We can debate the merits of the concept, as well as the intellectual honesty of the people who use it, till we're blue in the face.

Or we can follow up with the ""men are toxic effect"", and discuss how it is in fact a problem that society views men as negative and toxic. In fact, you might say that the concept of toxic masculinity *is often part of the problem*, due to the labelling effect mentioned above (or in layman terms, it sounds offensive, even if it isn't ""supposed"" to).

I would even advocate for half way agreeing with some people in order to throw in the *men are toxic* / *women are wonderful effect*, since toxic masculinity is in theory supposed to be about *society* and how *society treats men*.  So they will either have to agree with you, or out themselves as a misandrist.

I know this kind of stuff usually happens organically but I figured I'd try to throw this out there.

Being in that industry for 10 years I have seen many Tech companies being extremely apologetic, sponsor scholarships in colleges for female students, support groups like ""Girls who code"", try their best ""to correct the wrong"" by encouraging and emphasizing female recruitment. 

There is a gender disparity in Nursing and other occupations with huge majority female. Media ignores this. There is no hospital that has come out and apologized for hiring more female nurses, no scholarship for male students, no one who is trying to ""correct he wrong"". No encouragement for male recruitment

Why is this? It can't be pay... most tech and nursing jobs pay almost the same. The typical response about why male gender disparity in not highlighted include:

1. Men are not interested and don't want to do this job. Wonder why there is no effort to go to high-schools/colleges and encourage men into these professions like there is for women in tech and Finance?
2. Men don't have the patience and aptitude for this job. Can you even begin to say such things about women and tech, without getting fired?
3. Social pressure against male nurses/no good role models. The same could have been said about women and tech a few decades ago. But there has been a huge effort to correct this. Now movies and serials have made conscious effort to portray women in the ""tech-genius"" role. The only portrayal of male in nursing seems to be just for getting  a laugh.

Women actively look for men who make more money.  Married men make more money not because the wife is cooking and cleaning which somehow helps them earn more, but because their wives saw that they were on promising career trajectories before marrying them.  The incentive for men is therefore to earn more money to attract a partner:

This study shows that a lack of men will cause women to focus on their careers instead of finding a husband. The effect is weaker for women who are more attractive and therefore have a better chance of finding a high earning husband.  This indicates that ""husband hunting"" comes first and ""career hunting"" comes second, as the obviously less less desirable option:

A loss of income is the single largest predictive factor for a wife wanting to divorce her husband.  The same is not true the other way around.  **And interestingly, a wife's inability or refusal to ""cook and clean"" does not effect a husband's willingness to divorce her, either.**  Indicating that neither side of this is enforced by men, even indirectly.

I'm not sure if this study goes into this, but my guess is personality issues, things like nagging and harassment, might be the biggest factor for wanting a divorce for husbands:

All of these trends start long before people get married or have kids, so children aren't responsible in those cases.

However, when children do enter the picture, it's women who actively enforce these gender norms. Most men would love to stay home and help take care of the kids, but mothers send a clear message to fathers: *""I'm taking care of the kids, in fact I'm naturally better at it than you, so you need to give up on that and instead go out and earn more money to pay for everything""*.

Whether you think it's on purpose, or the byproduct of biology (ie the fact that women are the ones who get pregnant and breastfeed), this gender role does not appear to be enforced in a top down manner by men or because of some kind of patriarchal conspiracy among men.

It also benefits women more than it does men, which some people might even call a *privilege*.  This effect leads to:

* A better work-life balance,

* higher reported levels of life satisfaction, 

* higher reported levels of happiness, 

* more free time, 

* more time spent at home,

* better health outcomes, 

* lower mortality rates,

* and a longer life.

So if men are responsible for this gender role, it is under misguided pretenses.

The traditional explanation that women have less time for a career because of unpaid labor may play a part, especially as a kind of feedback loop, but this effect exists long before marriage and children enter the picture. The answer to the question of who makes less and should therefore spend more time at home with the children is already decided long before the question gets asked.  In part because married men have already spent most of their lives sacrificing their time, health, and happiness in order to maximize their income to attract a wife.

It's also women who tend to ""decide"" who does what in a relationship after children are born.  In fact there's a plethora of research showing that wives and girlfriends command significantly more power and control in relationships than men do. This isn't meant to point fingers and blame women for anything, it just counters the common narrative that we hear about this (where men are by default the ones blamed), so I figure it's worth mentioning.

3 month maternity to both parents taken simultaneously.

60% contributions from both employers for childcare till age 3.

Although this is a valid cause in theory (although the nature pay gap itself is questionable, and likely not as black-and-white as the strikers present it as), the strike shows a stark contrast and double standard in how discrimination and inequality is looked upon when affecting men versus when affecting women. 

Let's look at the areas in Switzerland where *men* could argue that they are on the receiving end of ""less pay for the same work.""

[Conscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Switzerland). Men in Switzerland undergo conscription, or forced military service. This is essentially unpaid labor, as they cannot pursue education or employment during the conscription period, and the compensation is far less than they'd earn in a regular job. An alternative service is available, called *Civilian Service*, but this is again nothing more than forced labor for less than minimum wage.

Also, note that those deemed unfit for military service must pay a 3% higher tax rate until age 30:

>People determined unfit for service, where fitness is defined as ""satisfying physically, intellectually and mentally requirements for military service or civil protection service and being capable of accomplishing these services without harming oneself or others"",[10] are exempted from service but pay an additional 3% of annual income tax until the age of 30, unless they are affected by a disability.

Both by the labor and higher tax rate, men are paying more for women for the social services of the state.

Second, men in switzerland [have a higher pension age](https://www.ch.ch/en/retirement-age/) by a whole year, with men becoming eligible at 65 versus 64 for women. This is an entire year of wages, and an entire year that men must work extra. Men are essentially paying for women's early retirement, on top of the service they've already done via conscription. This surely counts as 'working more for less pay', as men must work more to earn a smaller duration of pension pay.",BlueOrange22,t2_ydooo5,0.98,136,16

* **Women;** 14% of Men, 5% of Women, 12% of Republicans, 6% of Democrats
* **About the Same:** 58% of Men, 54% of Women, 68% of Republicans, 45% of Democrats
* Millennial Women are more likely to think Men have it easier compared to Boomer and Gen X Women. Silent Gen Women are less likely to think Men have it easier and more likely to think Women have it easier.

* 29% - ""Men have more job opportunities and better workplace treatment""
* 10% - ""Men have less family / household work""
* Some surprises
   * Only 4% cited sexual harassment
   * Only 4% cited physical safety
   * No specific category was given for biology (pregnancy and periods) which is probably the first thing I would say. I think Women have it easier but this is one area I would concede
   * 9% were categorized as other; 8% as general; 16% as non answer / unknown

&#x200B;

**Why Women Have it Easier? - Top Answers given**

* 30% - ""Women have more job opportunities and better workplace treatment
   * True from my experience
   * Seems like a lot of MRA movement is rooted in opposition to affirmative action policies
   * This can be seen by several quotes speaking about ""minority / non-white women"" having privilege
* 9% - ""Laws and courts favour women""
   * This is an objective fact
* 8% - ""Women get believed when they make false accusations of sexual assault / harassment or sexism""
   * Again, pretty clearly true according to me
* Most MRAs I've encountered, especially non-male MRAs, got into it due to divorce or false accusation issues
   * As in, they or someone they knew was a victim of rigged divorce courts or false accusation
* Some surprises
   * Only 5% cited how Women have the freedom to work or not work while Men have to work. This and hypergamy was the catalyst for me which I am a little surprise only 5% of people who think Women have it eaiser started it
   * No  one said dating which I think is a super important issue and something many Men talk about. Though I think Pew Research suppressed it to avoid giving credence to ""incel talking points""
* 16% were ""Other"", 22% were ""General"", 22% were ""no answer / unknown""
   * I see a significant suppression of common MRA talking points such as suicide rates, dating, circumcision,  empathy gap, women are wonderful effect, etc.

199,mu2w9y,2021-04-19,MensRights,Saying that fathers want custody to pay less child support is like saying mothers don't want to give them custody because they're greedy and want to maximize their child support (and harm their own children in the process),"So recently Arkansas passed a law encouraging shared parenting.  And while most people seem fairly supportive of this, there are a few people who are saying that fathers just want this to get out of their child support payments.  As if a father couldn't ever want to spend time with his children. And the only thing they're good for is earning money to pay the mother.

The reality though is that our child support system is broken and often encourages unreasonable payments from the father, including when he has split custody with the mother.

1. In many places, child custody isn't factored in at all.  Men pay 100% of the child care costs no matter how much time they have with their kids.  The result is that many men end up paying $150% of the child care costs.  50% from their share of custody and 100% through child support.  Such a situation often makes it financially prohibitive to have split custody even if you can convince the courts to give it to you. Child support itself can therefore encourage parental alienation which is harmful to children.

2. It is often the case that neither the mother's income nor the father's income is used to calculate how much he has to pay.  They either have ""cost calculators"" and expect the father to pay that amount, no matter what his ability to do so is.  Or they impute incomes for the mother and the father, usually exaggerating the difference between the two, and expect the father to pay more than what he should in theory have to pay.

3. In many places, the salaries that judges pay themselves are paid by child support and alimony payments. It's not always the case that you pay $X and the mother receives $X. Lots of times you pay more than what the mother receives. And the state takes the difference. Which incentivises unreasonably large payments because the people ordering those payments are also paying themselves with that money.

4. Many of the calculations are based on 1970s era logic where it was common for men to work jobs that could pay for everyone, including their wife and kids. Nowadays both couples usually work and the economy makes it nearly impossible for a man to find work that can pay for everyone. But that's what the state expects out of him, no matter what his arrangement was with the mother before they separated. Which results in very large payments that put many men into near destitution because they have no money left over for themselves after paying for everyone else (and also don't qualify for poverty programs which they should be entitled to at that point).

Nobody thinks that child support is inherently bad or that parents shouldn't help pay their fair share of the costs.

What should be normal for a lot of people though is split custody with no child support.

The mom can work (more than she did when married) and should be expected to work just like the dad. And this is in line with ending gender norms also.

It's funny because sometimes you'll see women saying things like, *""he only pays me $50 a month""*, like that's somehow a bad thing and makes him a deadbeat.  When really what's happening is they have joint custody and she makes close to what he makes. And in an area that has halfway decent child support laws.  So what we're looking at is progress towards gender equality on all grounds, including employment and wages for women.  But somehow she still can't stop reducing her baby daddy to his ability to provide and give her money.

Why?

Because at the end of the day, she probably doesn't want to have to work to earn her own money.  Just like a lot of other people on this planet.

So who really is the greedy deadbeat in this scenario?  The man who wants to be treated like an equal, including as an equal parent to the mother?  Or the mother who wants free money without having to work for it?

Why should it be on the father to earn money for them?  And why should it be on the mother to watch the kids?  I thought we were in favor of gender equality.  And I thought gender equality was also supposed to ""help men"" by ""ending harmful gender norms"".  For example by ending the expectation that men should have to be providers. What happened to this crowd now that this is what we see happening in the real world?

> I've actually managed to convert Mens rights activists with this document it's great.

So I figured this must be some killer statistical data, a slam-dunk that proves the gender pay gap myth is actually real, once and for all.

So here's what I found:

> KEY FINDINGS

> There are small differences by gender for destinations of respondents one year after graduation, with women slightly more likely to be taking Masters or teacher-training courses and men more likely to be studying for a PhD.

Huh. Well, we already know that teaching isn't a well-paid profession, at least compared to the other jobs that physics graduates can go into. And we know that people with PhDs earn higher salaries that people with bachelors or Masters degrees.

Gee, that already looks like women graduates are making choices which will result in them earning less.

> Gender differences in destination are more apparent for graduates with BSc than MPhys/ MSci degrees. Women with BSc degrees were the most likely group to go into teacher training with 9.3% choosing this route, compared to 4.4% of men with a BSc degree, 1.4% of women with a MPhys/MSci degree and 1.9% men with a MPhys/MSci degree.

> Women with BSc degrees were the least likely to report that their occupation was related to physics and the least likely to report that their physics background was useful for their occupation.

Hmm, so women are less likely to work use their degree in work after graduation. That could have an impact on their earnings...

> 3.1 Salary levels for graduates one year after graduation

> The median salary for female respondents was £21,800, 4.3% lower than their male peers.

A 4.3% gap doesn't seem surprising, given that women are more likely to go into teaching and less likely to go into a field that uses their physics degree.

> Women were more likely than men to work in education and less likely to work in electronics/IT/software.

Women choosing the lower-paying occupations, a common cause of the gender earnings gap.

**To sum up**: I don't know what to tell you; I just can't see how this study supports the feminist gender pay gap narrative. It looks to me like every other piece of credible research on the topic: women make personal choices about their study and their work that lead to lower earnings.

We're not going to see equal earnings unless feminists decide to put a gun to all women's heads to force them to make different choices. That would be silly; much better that feminists just get over themselves and leave women alone to make the choices that best suit themselves.",EricAllonde,t2_ynh8y,0.72,8,2

205,g79jlt,2020-04-24,MensRights,Gender Statistics websites that are not Feminist?,"I've been brainstorming something i've wanted to do for a long time now.  Throughout the years, i've noticed excellent communities like this sub, as well as many brave Youtubers & blogs & news publications who (despite so much opposition from supremacists), continue to do Current News & Analysis in this field. 

At the same time, i've also noticed what appears to be a lack of MRA-managed websites that collect & share gender statistics.  And of course, googling it shows me that virtually all (not most, but all) gender stats websites are unquestionably feminist in their prejudice. I mean, it seems you literally cannot find one gender stats website that at least gives the *pretense* of not being a raging sexist POS feminist.

so.....My question to you is this: 

**Do you know of any credible Gender Statistics websites that you know of, that are NOT in any way created by & for feminism?** 

When i say 'gender stats', i mean the stats covering topics like jobs (work fatality rate, injury rate, wage, etc) to health (smoking & alcohol & drug addiction rates, life expectancy, cardio health, obesity, etc) to social roles (who usually pays for dates, which spouse chooses the family car vs which spouse pays for that car, who is the primary breadwinner, who is conscripted) to consumption patterns (who spends more, and on what).  Also, it's important that the website allows you to filter by country & religion & continent & time period (and so on).  And finally, all these stats must have links to reputable evidence, backing up the numbers.

as an example of what quality i'm looking for, take a look at this famous website which tracks coronavirus statistics: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

You see that quality? 

that's what i'm looking for, except strictly about gender, instead of Covid-19. 

if you cannot find any such website, then....i'm thinking about eventually creating one.   And if i do, then my goal is to make all seven billion people of the planet into my potential audience.  Whether you are feminist or MRA, male or female, Western or non-Western, gay or straight, leftwing or rightwing, Muslim or Christian or atheist etc etc, **i am hoping to create a universal quantitative resource (eventually in multiple languages!) that provides the ever-growing evidence of the reality of gender.**",BreedingColumbia,t2_cx2w26d,0.97,22,8

Edit 2: I give up.   Enjoy the decline.   

Unusual and long post here.    The non-socialist majority may enjoy it for the stats and the un-pc quotes by figures like George Orwell, Nicola Tesla and Christopher Hitchens.  

MRA's are right to suggest that men got a raw deal under traditionalism.    I'm not suggesting we go back to a situation where e.g. a man be forced to pay his wives' debts.   Or that people be forced into certain roles.   I'm suggesting that the majority of men and women would be happier in a traditionalist arrangement: the woman takes care of the kids and home and the man is respected and honored for his contributions in turn.   Nor would this prevent women from achieving status in the male sphere.   It would just be more unusual since women would be doing the more important work of raising children.

A return to a traditional conservative lifestyle is impossible absent collapse.   Female liberation has [never](https://archive.org/details/b20442580) been internally reversed.   Unfortunately it is also incompatible with large inequalities due to female hypergamy.    The majority of men are left out in the cold, so have no impetus to work.  Therefore a combination of men's rights and socialism are required if civilization is to continue.   This will naturally lead to men and women embracing traditional gender roles.    The only other alternative is a return to patriarchy, however that is exceedingly unlikely for reasons JD Unwin explains in the above link.   

I was recently watching a documentary about a financial depression in the late 19th century.   A (female) professor noted that ""many women were forced"" into the workplace.   It struck me as an odd turn of phrase, since feminists claim that women weren't ""allowed"" to work back then.   Turns out this is false.   Karen Straughan notes that there are records e.g. of female blacksmiths going back to the middle ages.   Women could work, they just didn't want to.   Why would they?   For 90 percent of the population working sucked.   It still does.  Also, it's hard to work when you're pregnant.   

The only way feminists can get away with characterizing the traditional female sphere as a prison is by lying about it.   In truth, women could own [property](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/continuity-and-change/article/favoured-or-oppressed-married-women-property-and-coverture-in-england-16601800/617F23DD2D64A036C58E0BF7D56F89BE), wife-beating was severely [punished](https://www.debunker.com/texts/ruleofthumb.html), and women were respected for their role in society.    Alexis de Tocqueville commented on the essential equality of the male and female spheres in Democracy in America (1840) :

“Americans,” he said, did not think that men and women should perform the same tasks, “but they show an equal regard for both their perspective parts; and though their lot is different, they consider both of them as being of equal value.”

Women have ALWAYS been greatly respected by men for being mothers and nurturers.   What is a more important job than raising a child?   It was only a small number of envious man-haters that decided otherwise.   

The feminist movement appears to have arisen not do to ""oppression"" but boredom.   Rich women lived lives of luxury most men could only dream of, but they were envious of the social status of their doctor and lawyer male relatives.   They wanted the privileges of both the female and male spheres.  They wanted to ""have it all"".

A number of intellectuals expressed concern, though not as many as you'd expect considering the enormity of what feminists were proposing.   The socialist Earnest Belford Bax claimed that women were already the [privileged sex](https://archive.org/details/fraudoffeminism00baxerich).    The socialist Mother Jones, who spent most of her time organizing male coal miners and fighting child labor, considered it absurd that women could be ""liberated"" by work.   And Nicola Tesla, one of the most brilliant men who ever lived, predicted that ""equality"" between men and women would quickly lead to female superiority and massive social dysfunction: 

""This struggle of the human female toward sex equality will end in a new sex order, with the female as superior. The modern woman, who anticipates in merely superficial phenomena the advancement of her sex, is but a surface symptom of something deeper and more potent fermenting in the bosom of the race.""

The Catholic GK Chesterton, who embraced socialist ideas about land reform, suggested that mixing the traditional male and female spheres would be a disaster for society.   

This [article](http://gkcdaily.blogspot.com/2015/03/chesterton-notorious-anti-feminist.html) provides a decent summary.   

>Woman is wrong, he considers, to try to adapt herself to society by making a man of herself. The contrary should come about—Society should adapt itself to womanhood by becoming gentler. To Feminists, he acknowledges that women undergo a revolting tyranny in factories; but he wanted to destroy the factories, while they, he felt, were content with destroying womanhood.

""The virtues of the Family and Home, due to free choice and limitation, form the basic cell of the social organism. Banish the spirit of Home, and you suppress the very possibility of a sanely constituted society.""

Chesterton advocated wealth redistribution to the poor so that women wouldn't have to work.   George Orwell, who despite popular belief was a socialist, recommended the same: 

""Far more drastically than anyone has proposed hitherto, taxation will have to be graded so as to encourage child-bearing and to save women with young children from being obliged to work outside the home (CW 16, 223).""

""This, of course, is a subject of great interest in India, and roughly what we want discussed is how far women benefit by escaping from home and whether in the long run it is desirable for them to undertake the same work as men” (CW 13, 474).

Feminists set about to destroy the ""patriarchal"" family, but they had nothing to replace it with.   We are not living in hunter-gatherer societies; the idea that the ""whole tribe"" would raise children has amounted instead to children being stuck all day in daycares and classrooms.   Women aren't able to spend as much time with their children as they'd like: they're too busy working.   They have replaced loving husbands with asshole bosses.   In a tragic irony, the ""new American dream"" for women is to become a [housewife](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/09/12/is-opting-out-the-new-american-dream-for-working-women/#3c1b00ad623a).     

The single mother experiment has been a disaster.    Feminists assumed that men were only needed for their wallets, whereas it turns out that that males are [crucial](http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/family/experts-say-father-s-involvement-pivotal-proper-child-rearing) at every stage of child rearing.   The statistics for children raised by single mothers are nothing short of horrific.  

What about men?   Men no longer feel like they have a role to fulfill, so are increasingly dropping out of society.   Suicides are at all time high.   Drug and alcohol addiction is rampant.    

By privileging girls in school and women in work, young women are now out-earning young men.   This leads to women being unable to find what they consider suitable partners due to hypergamy.  

Women have become ever more hateful and spiteful toward men.   Part of this is due to feminist lies, part of this is due to being forced to compete with the opposite sex.   The sexes aren't supposed to compete with one another; that's not how we were designed.   We're supposed to be complementary.  Since male leaders don't want to compete with women, they gave them ever more privileges at the expense of men.    So much for patriarchy theory.  

And now we find the reason why being a housewife is the new American dream: Research has found that stay-at-home mothers are [happier](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3634473/The-job-makes-happiest-Housewife-Survey-finds-stay-home-mothers-satisfied-profession.html) than those who work (female unhappiness is actually at an all time high).   So the whole feminist experiment was a gigantic waste of time.   More than that, it was a potentially fatal social experiment.    

Women who don't have children are more likely to get [cancer](http://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health-specialist/childless-women-and-cancer.aspx).   The same applies to women who wait until their thirties to have children (the current trend).    Fewer and fewer women are giving birth.   Since population levels are unsustainable, more and more immigration is required.   This, in turn, leads to increased mistrust in communities.    The ruling class is able to play off workers against one another with ease, preventing solidarity.  

Male creative genius is ignored and suppressed instead of being nurtured.    And for what?   So women can become unhappier?  

In The Red Pill, Warren Farrell emphasizes flexibility of roles.   But women don't seem to want flexibility for men.   They become resentful of stay at home dads.   They recoil at men expressing emotions.   They refuse to ""date down.""   They demand all of their traditional privileges.  

The association between communism and feminism arose mostly from Marx's benefactor Friedrich Engels.   However it is interesting that many of the early socialists rejected his views on the subject and had no problem with traditional gender roles.    They didn't think women should be *forced* to be housewives, but as mentioned, only rich women were privileged enough to conceive of work as liberation.   

Feminists have re-engineered society but it has not helped either men or women.   In the Israeli Kibbutz, which embraces an anarchic form of social organization, people were not given any gender roles but naturally became the most traditionalist society in the world.   This leads me to believe that the vast majority of both men and women prefer behaving like men and women.   We have created a society that ignores the happiness of the 99% and caters to outliers among both sexes -- in particular lesbians.    These outliers should not be oppressed, but they shouldn't dictate how the rest of us behave either.  

If it is respect and independence women are after, men's rights combined with traditional gender roles would allow them to have both.   They would be respected as mothers, would still be allowed to enter the male sphere if they wished (though only on equal terms -- no feminist bullshit), and wouldn't have to suffer being wage slaves.   They would not be able to simply divorce the man and take the kids and his money, so marriages would remain intact.   Men would likewise be able to act as men again, without being demonized; they would be respected and honored for the work they do to maintain civilization, and would have all the rights that women currently have.   

Egalitarian economics would ensure that the majority of men not be excluded from romance due to hypergamy.

This is a throwaway for obvious legal reasons but I want to vent and talk about the SERIOUS sexism problem I'm having at my job. I'm a waiter at a bar/restaurant. A BBQ chain here on the east coast. I actually love my job. Its great money and the team I work with is great.
The problem I'm having is that I want to be a bartender.
I've  been asking to be a bartender since my interview. The interviewing manager was actually the one who suggested I study the bar book and learn, so i did! Months go by. I ask the bar manager frequently about a position opening up. I was told several times by several managers that our current district manager doesn't want too many men behind the bar. This irked me. But we hadn't hired/trained any new bartenders so there was really no need for another one. 
Fast-forward 6 months today.
After months of pretty much begging for this position. And performing very well. Working full-time(opening and closing their restaurant) with exceedingly high guest satisfaction surveys. I open up today to find that a new waitress is training to be a bartender. Another female bartender(bringing it to 6 women and 3 male bartenders). With no previous bar experience and far-less seniority than me.
It hurt. Like a lot.
I've worked very hard for this company and want to advance my career but its difficult when they are being so very sexist. Its not subtle. Its not even frowned upon. They tell me to my face. Its because I am a man that I cannot become a bartender.
I'm already looking for positions elsewhere but I wish I didn't have to. I actually enjoy the location I'm at and don't want to have to work my way up to full time elsewhere. 
Sexism like this is rampant in bars I know, but that doesn't make it right. I'm sick of being denied a promotion just because of my gender. 
If it were anything else I would be fine with it. If i was terrible at my job I would understand them not promoting me. But I'm not, and they know that. What should I do? Is there anything I should pursue legally or should I just move on?",Itsbecauseofmyjunk,t2_oakt2,0.94,69,40
208,9c1qo7,2018-09-01,MensRights,Belgium shop fined for discriminating against male job-seeker," 

The man in Louvain (Leuven), near Brussels, complained to Belgium's institute for gender equality, which won his case at a labour tribunal.

Rejecting his application for stock manager, the clothes shop said it was ""looking for a female colleague"".

The institute says it usually resolves discrimination cases out of court.

Neither the shop in Louvain nor the job-seeker were named, for legal reasons.

The award of €13,289.84 represents about six months' gross salary in the post that the man wanted.

The shop was also ordered to pay one euro to the Institute for Equality between Women and Men (IEFH).

A lawyer at the institute, Pauline Loeckx, told the BBC that in 2017 she and her colleagues handled about 50 claims from men and 60 from women concerning sex discrimination during job recruitment.

**At the tribunal, she said, the Louvain clothes shop argued that it had found a more capable woman to do the job. But the evidence of discrimination was in the e-mail it had sent to the male applicant.**

 ""With men you see the discrimination mostly at the recruitment stage, whereas with women there is discrimination at each stage of work: in recruitment, salary levels and dismissal,"" Ms Loeckx said.

210,1j8h4i,2013-07-28,MensRights,Fulbright grant and gender.,"Im a Fulbright research grant winner, working somewhere in the Middle East, and I would like to share my experiences regarding this prestigious grant and gender.  

While I've been here, I've been smacked in the face with gender roles, and have been critically analyzing gender with a passion.  Part of this research led me here to these boards.  I've enjoyed lurking here, and I want to give back a little.  

The first thing that hits you when you see the faces of grant winners in country, is about 7 out of 10 are women.  Women are everywhere and women dominate.  Moreover, they're well versed in a number of terms I've heard for the first time.  Lets just say I'm a scientist (I don't want to give myself away), and I've never heard terms like ""mansplaining"" before I met this group.  

Its been a strange trip.  I've been on these boards, learning the awful truth of domestic violence, the lie of the 77 cents to $1 gender wage gap, the fallacy of composition that composes ""patriarchy theory,"" among other things.  I've been learning this as I've seen a group of women, forcefully, argue for ""team woman.""  

One of the more interesting moments of these arguments for ""team woman"" occurred just soon after I learned about [how males are strongly selected against in education, all the way to elementary school](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/the-boys-at-the-back/?_r=0), resulting in a very large imbalance of women over men in higher education.  This, combined with [why the wage gap is nonsense](http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2013/jul/15/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-women-earn-77-percent-mens-pay-same/), leads the country in a serious problem where valuable education resources are being spent, disproportionately, on the sex who, statistically, will pull back from the work force.  

While I was with the group, the topic drifted to complaining about the sexist issue of the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields.  Just like when you go fishing, you let it run a little before you set the hook.  I let them all lay out their argument, predictably using the standard Marxist arguments and coarsely fitting them to gender.  This is where I interjected.  I asked them to look around the table.  They were confused. I asked them to note the overrepresentation of women here for this prestigious grant and what this reflected for gender and the universities as a whole.  I added in the statistics of citing the overrepresentation of women in universities.   I cited various sources them, then I gave them my own personal anecdotes on how I've seen women welcomed in STEM fields, and asked them to cite even one specific barrier that blocked their admittance into these fields.  I asked them to bear in mind the general over representation of women in universities. This is where I asked them, how damaging is to society to furiously advocate for ""equality"" of a small subset that already generally overrepresented.  I pointed out how they they could not provide one actual gendered barrier while they overlook this massive inequality for men in education.  I asked them to consider the hypocrisy in considering their argument a stance for ""equality"" when it was promoting a very strong gendered inequality affecting *men* that starts all the way back to elementary school. 

I wanted to continue on with the data on women and how [women under 30 earn more money than men if childless](http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2015274,00.html) and the societal repercussions all this imbalanced resource spending on a gender that, statistically, withdrew from the work force, and how we should try to push back for an equal representation in universities.  I wanted to demonstrate their own personal anecdotes on arguing for ""quality of life"" and looking for lower paying jobs that allowed them to focus on their families.  I wanted to do much more, but I couldnt.

Lets say the conversation devolved into furious arguments and defensive tu quoque fallacies.  They weren't going to hear it.  I lost some friends, and if I was in the liberal arts, I'm sure these women would blacklist me if they were ever part of a hiring committee or grant review that oversaw my name.  They won't, and thats the only reason why I could say what I said.  ",throwaway_xy_,t2_cjlw0,0.85,53,30

* They want their experiences invalidated yet will always claim that women attempt suicide at higher rates (which is not true) when it comes to men killing themselves more. This is invalidating men's experiences.
* They want to not be judged by their number of sexual partners but will call any man who disagrees with them incels or virgins. They will further complain about how men should stop valuing themselves and other men by their body count yet women clearly do the same thing in this example.
* They do not want women to be generalized but then proceed to generalize all men as rapists, creeps, pedophiles, murderers, etc. On the topic of rape, men are not even close to the supermajority of rapists compared to women but feminists refuse to admit this.
* They view gender based scholarships and affirmative action as equality despite women already making up a majority of college enrollment.
* Feminists claim that they want to abolish all gender roles but will never adhere to them themselves. They demand men pay the first date if not all the dates, demand that men ask them out, demand men propose, demand a man taller or substantially taller than them. They will never advocate for more women working in dirty lower paying jobs, just the white collar cushy office jobs. They only want to abolish gender roles that are convenient to them.
* They claim ""my body, my choice"" but will actively genitally mutilate (circumcise) their sons. It is mostly done by women and requires a mother's consent. They do nothing when it comes to the selective service or the draft for men.
* They call men misogynistic for dating preferences such as having no body hair or not being fat but demand a man 6 feet tall with a 6 figure income.
* Feminists claim that men never take accountability when men get longer sentences for the same crimes.
* Feminists will claim that the suffering of women is a man's fault and the suffering of a man is a man's fault or the sufferers fault too. How much have they done to address the growing educational gap between men and women? When women fall behind in education, it is a man's fault. When men fall behind in education, it is a man's fault.

221,cx1ice,2019-08-29,MensRights,"Tinder & Life Biases Favoring Women in Light of ""Gender Equality""","In light of Tinder's supposed ""joke"" about height verification, which didn't seem like a joke considering their tweets still hinted at ""not lying about who you are"" or ""staying true to yourself"" on your profile, if men on Tinder are, even as a joke, forced to prove their height, why is there no requirement for women to prove that their breasts are not fake? I don’t want to date any women who is faking her inferior flat chested genes. How come women get to cheat their genetics with fake breasts and men can’t? What about how women get to fraud their bad skin genetics by covering their acne and bad skin with makeup but men can’t because it would not be masculine? How is this fair and equal? Or what about women getting to wear heels just because it makes them feel ""feminine"" even though it makes it so it is even harder for a shorter man who stands next to a woman with high heels, the same man who is not allowed to wear boots or any type of shoes that give him height because this is a ""woman only"" thing.

And before I get an influx of people saying oh you’re just a salty ""Manlet"" who can't take a joke, I’m 6’3. I’m just having a hard time understanding how women want equality but they won’t work constructions jobs, they won't do any of the actual physically demanding jobs, but want equal pay, even though statistics show the pay rate is literally the same for every job for men and women with only a few outliers. And let's not forget today's standards or expectations and criteria that a man has to fit in today's feminist dominated culture, which requires that a man: must always have a job, have friends and be sociable, be really good at something, be at least somewhat muscular, constantly have to approach women, don't be shy, don't have any noticeable disabilities, have sexual experience, have relationship experience, have a low body fat percentage, have the intelligence to succeed in life but don't actually be a nerd, don't have bad skin (because you can't cover it up with makeup, that's for women only), be able to provide for kids, regardless if she says she wants any, have your own home or apartment, have a car and drive it, have more income potential than her, have a good social standing, be older than her, be taller than her, have better forward facial growth and better facial aesthetics than her, have more education experience than her, be willing to give up time and energy to ""chase"" her even if she decides to reject you. What are a woman's expectations on the other hand? Don't be a fat landwhale and maybe wear makeup. Let's not forget the virtue signaling women who say ""I don't care about looks,"" but then turn around and select their partner who just happens to be 6'5 and has a model tier face with wealthy parents as well as the blue pilled people who always chime in with their ""personality"" rhetoric though, because that is what really matters. The Red Pill is not even objective anymore, and as nihilistic or morbid as it sounds, the black pilled theory of only looks mattering at all in the world, seems to be the only theory that makes even remote sense in today's society that is seeing more of a rise in virgin men who have never had a relationship due to women's ever-increasing expectations.

And EVERYTIME these expectations from women are mentioned you always have people go on the thread going, oh well I know this and that person who don’t fit those expectations, and they have a girlfriend, THESE ARE OUTLIERS, just because you know 1 out of 100 people who are ugly or short or not wealthy or have status that have a girlfriend, it means nothing because these are outliers, which are irrelevant and not what the actual norm is with how women actually choose their partner. It seems more like women want “equality” when it only gives them an advantage over men, who are already held at such high standards, that nowadays, if you’re not at least 6’2, have a 6-inch schlong, earn 6 figures and have a chiseled jawline, good luck finding a woman.

On top of this women will always scale UP and look for a partner that looks better than them in terms of their face and physique because they are the choosers and they can. Meanwhile, the poor schmuck who falls for the average women like this, will get forced to marry the women, give her kids and then get divorce raped once she decides to monkey branch onto a different man, take half of the man’s earnings in divorce court because the courts always favor the women AND continue to receive child support/alimony for at least 18 years AND get new money from a new idiot who falls for the same scam. And not to mention the less obvious things, like women preying on a man who is going places in life or is becoming successful who falls for the women who then almost always decides to either move on from him, cheat on him or divorce him after he becomes attached and ruin the man’s future or life as well as today’s feminist empowered society that encourages women to ruin a man’s life by lying about them being raped because the judge will, again, always take the women’s side even if she is lying as well as giving a man no say whatsoever when it comes to keeping a child that a woman becomes pregnant with. The saddest part about all of this is not only what I just wrote, but also the fact that the feminist agenda warriors will make sure that it doesn’t see the light of day on any subreddit and claim that it breaks some rules even if I am invoking my freedom of speech by giving an objective view of the actual reality of gender equality.

Despite all these findings (and more), male problems do not appear to attract much attention. Why? Because, for evolutionary reasons, humans are less prone to respond with **empathy** to men and boys than to women and girls. In this four-part series of posts, I'll present a substantial amount of evidence to demonstrate both the causes and implications of the **gender empathy gap**. Be aware that some of it is quite disturbing, so make sure you are in the right state of mind before you begin reading.

First, I recommend watching this fantastic video for an illustrated introduction to the subject, which all-too-painfully demonstrates the existence of the empathy gap with tangible and shocking evidence: [ICMI20: Eccentrik Hat - ""Why Men Need Help And Why Feminism Won't Help Them""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwXrFedCW0U)

You may also find [MANNdat's interview of Dr. Warren Farrell on the lack of empathy towards men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE7ZGqaElCc) interesting, or his guest post [The Gender Gap in Empathy — A path to ending the gender war?](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-do-life/202004/the-gender-gap-in-empathy) on PsychologyToday [or the same post on genderempathygap.de](https://genderempathygap.de/the-gender-gap-in-empathy/).

Let us start by quoting some excerpts from [The Male Gender Empathy Gap: Time for psychology to take action (Seager et al., 2016)](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1534129/) because I think they made an excellent point:
> Whether we like it or not, there are different patterns and expectations relating to the expression of distress in males and females. This means that **male distress is often overlooked, or seen simply as bad behavior so that male distress is, in effect, invisible**.
> 
> \[The\] archetypal “male gender script” \[…\] has been described by Seager, Sullivan & Barry (2014a) as an evolutionary and universal pressure on men defining how they must live to be a successful male. This script consists of three main rules:
> 1. Be a fighter and a winner
> 2. Be a provider and a protector
 >3. Retain mastery and control over one’s feelings
> 
> Farrell and Gray (book in preparation) talk about this in terms of “social bribes”. According to this proposition, social groups across the human species have survived more effectively because males have evolved collectively to protect them. The success of all societies historically has therefore been built upon the blood, sweat and tears of men, sacrificing their lives in wars to preserve the freedom of all and risking their lives to build the infrastructure of civilization. Working class men in particular have been expected by virtue of their gender to die in tunnels, on tall buildings, down mines and on the high seas, supplying the buildings, transport, food supplies and security that create the comfort of a civilized life for all. **Across the ages, men have been “socially bribed” into behaving this way by the honour and social approval of their tribe or society.** In this way men (and some women) have been afforded the status of heroes because of their strength or courage. At the same time, men (but not usually women) have equally been “shamed” to the extent that they do not conform to this pattern. There is no greater illustration of this than the white feathers that were handed out as a symbol of cowardice to men in the UK who would not fight for their country. In our modern society, it may now be that the shame factor is growing greater for men as the opportunity to achieve heroic status is being reduced. It is for this reason that Farrell and Gray talk about the urgent need to help our boys in the future switch from ‘heroic intelligence’ to ‘health intelligence’ (see below). Equally, **there is a need for all of us in society to tune in more to male emotional language.** Rather than simply expecting men to talk differently we need to be **listening** differently to them. **Men reflexively — perhaps instinctively — hide vulnerability even under changing social, economic and political circumstances that are arguably generating more distress.** To reveal **vulnerability or failure of any kind can be deeply shaming for a man**. Because of such pressures we do not register male vulnerability and we all become less comfortable with the notion of males in need. This means that distressed men end up looking less like honourable victims and more like losers, criminals or even idiots.
> 
> \[…\]
> 
> So even when we do acknowledge publicly that men across the globe commit suicide at a much higher rate than women (nearly 4 times more in the UK), this still does not elicit our compassion. **If anything, we switch off.** In the same way we don’t really acknowledge or care that men account for a massive 97% of deaths at work in the UK InsideMan (2015) and 86% of people sleeping rough in England (Department for Communities and Local Government , 2016). When it comes to gender equality we only really think of women as beings legitimate victims and as having any cause for complaint. In the UK we still have a minister for ‘women and inequalities’ as if the two issues were intrinsically linked. **Ironically, therefore, what looks like a serious attempt to challenge gender prejudice towards women has the unintended consequence of reinforcing gender prejudice towards men.**
> 
> \[…\]
> 
> So there are deep rooted reasons why people don’t feel as much empathy for men as they do for women. **Men have evolved to be [disposable](https://twitter.com/Waters4Congress/status/1466598242511036421)**, being there to put their bodies on the line, to offer protection, not receive it. So a man in trouble evokes less sympathy than a woman or a child. This might help explain why men, when they are looking for sympathy from the judicial system, are six times more likely than a woman to get a conviction for an identical crime (Bradford, 2015). And **rather than sympathise with men over a possible inequality, our immediate social perception is that men must be six times more troublesome or else six times less in need of protection** from the prison system. Similarly, boys are more likely than girls to fail in school (Stoet & Geary, 2015), but **rather than address this as a gender inequality, we are unsympathetic, often perceiving boys as disruptive and lazy.** When couples who have children break up, fathers are still much less likely to get custody of children (Cancian et al, 2014), but **rather than rush to address this as another possible inequality we assume that fathers don’t miss their children like mothers do, and that children need their mothers more than their fathers**. The absent father is something that we have all been programmed to expect and tolerate. In fact we are tolerant of male suffering, or blind to it, in many other areas too, for example, violence by women against men is as widespread as violence by men against women (Straus, 2010) but violence against men attracts less attention.
> 
> \[…\]
> 
> As a profession that cares about human suffering, why are we \[psychologists\] not more alert to the signs all around us of the problems facing males, such as suicide? It seems quite likely that like the rest of society we are suffering from a type of blindness – **male gender blindness** (Seager et al, 2014b; Russ et al, 2015) – which makes it difficult for us to recognize the importance of this great elephant in the room of psychology. Similarly, we appear to be susceptible to the same collective **‘empathy gap’** as the rest of society when it comes to men’s issues. **Simple psychological experiments can show hard evidence of significant differences in our attitudes to the male and female genders.** For example, there are many vivid demonstrations in field experiments showing that members of the public immediately rush to help female victims of violence from a man, but turn a blind eye or even laugh when a man is the victim of the same level of force (e.g. ManKind Initiative, 2014 – see video link below). **In social psychology, just about the only group identity that does not elicit in-group-favoritism is male identity (Rudman & Goodwin, 2004)**. As psychologists, it should be extremely interesting that we have such different responses to the two complementary halves of the human race. It is hard to imagine a more central concern for psychological science and investigation.
> 
> \[…\]
> 
> **The world is forever turning, and future generations of psychologists will look back in wonder at how concern for the wellbeing of men and boys has remained in the doldrums for so long.** Our challenge to you as readers is to be among the first of a new generation of psychologists to take action, and to make men’s issues – as part of the human condition - visible. \[…\] Sometimes we need reminding that [mental health interventions for men, and recognising the problems facing boys] are linked e.g. when you pass a homeless man in the street, or see a man behaving badly, it’s easy to forget that he was once somebody’s little boy.

# Male Disposability

**Quoting Dr. Warren Farrell from one of his video interviews:**
> We've historically trained boys and men to die so that all the rest of us could survive. And it's harder to become psychologically attached to someone that you may soon lose, especially if your own survival is dependent on men's willingness to die. \[…\] Regarding a boy as a hero is a social bribe that we created; a social bribe for that boy to be disposable. \[…\] Love is blind enough for him to never acknowledge that a woman who falls in love with the officer and a gentleman is attaching her love in part to his potential disposability. \[…\] For parents raising a daughter meant caring about her safety but raising a boy meant being caught between a parental rock and a hard place. We wanted our son to be safe, for sure, but we also wanted to feel proud that he served his country in time of war. So whether as a soldier, a firefighter or another first responder we give social bribes for young men to die; why? So that his potential for death might increase our potential for life.

In this YouTube video [GUYS vs GIRLS Homeless Experiment | Who will you help? (channel: Karim Jovian)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmC4ikxT4v4), a man and a woman of comparable age and attractiveness pretend to be homeless. While the woman gets a ton of help, the man is not even noticed by bypassers and in those rare instances that he is, he gets told he is ""lazy"" and to ""find some work or die"".

In one study that examined the trolley dilemma titled [Moral Chivalry: Gender and Harm Sensitivity Predict Costly Altruism (FeldmanHall et al. 2016)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550616647448), **""88% of participants reported that they would push \[a\] man off the footbridge instead \[of a woman\]""**, that is 7 1/3 times as many people would rather sacrifice a man than a woman. The same study also found that **""\[p\]articipants kept significantly less money when interacting with a female target than a male target"" to save them from harm**. See specifically [figure 1](https://journals.sagepub.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/sage/journals/content/sppa/2016/sppa_7_6/1948550616647448/20170109/images/large/10.1177_1948550616647448-fig1.jpeg) which also confirms that women were more biased than men. Do not be confused by males' higher willingness of throwing off a female than a male bystander in this figure, as he is much less likely to throw her off in the first place, and the difference is small enough to constitute chance.

In [The Moral Machine experiment (Awad et al., 2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0637-6) it was shown that **both men and women were more inclined to save the lives of women over those of men**.

According to this [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com) article [A Hamas surprise: Women secure victory (Ian Fisher, 2006)](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/03/world/africa/03iht-hamas.html):
> She is Mariam Farhat, the mother of three Hamas advocates killed by Israelis. She bade one son goodbye in a homemade videotape before he stormed an Israeli settlement, killing five people before he was killed. **A comment she made later received wide publicity: She said that she wished she had 100 sons to sacrifice that way.** Known as the ""mother of martyrs,"" she is seen in a campaign video carrying a gun.
> […]
> Now she is one of the six women elected as Hamas legislators. **The election rules included quotas for women for all parties.** Farhat was surrounded recently at a Hamas victory rally at the women's campus of the Islamic University by young, outspoken, educated women who see no contradiction between religious militancy and modernity.
> […]
> She said that women, and especially the wives of top Hamas leaders, had long played a central role in Hamas's leadership, though she said that role had not been publicized to **protect** them.
> […]
> ""It is not only sacrificing sons,"" she said after the rally. ""There are different kinds of sacrifice - by money, by education. Everybody, **according to their ability** [and men's ability, apparently, is to be disposable], should sacrifice.""
> […]
> ""Every decision that is taken by Hamas is passed to us, not after the decision is made but before,"" she said. But **she also defended the decision of a young Nablus man to become a suicide bomber**.
> […]
> ""Why not ask the question from another angle?"" she said. ""Why would he blow himself up if he was not **subject to such great pressures**? What leads you to do such a bitter thing? People do this from anger and injustice, to bring back life to their own people by sacrificing their lives.""

A study with the title [Aggression as a function of the interaction of the sex of the aggressor and the sex of the victim (Taylor and Epstein 1967)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1967.tb01441.x) showed that **both men and women were less likely to administer electric shocks to women than men**. A replication of the experiment with the title [Would You Deliver an Electric Shock in 2015? Obedience in the Experimental Paradigm Developed by Stanley Milgram in the 50 Years Following the Original Studies (Doliński et al. 2017)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550617693060) also shows this, although their sample size was too small to have statistical significance.  

In a study with the title [Gender Differences in Empathic Sadness towards Persons of the Same- versus Other-sex during Adolescence (Stuijfzand et al. 2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5112287/), **boys from the age of 12 showed more empathy for girls than they did for boys, and they continued to show more empathy for females throughout their lives**. Both males and females showed less empathy for males than females. They also state that ""the growing interest in and attraction to the other-sex in adolescence may enhance male adolescents’ empathic responses towards female adolescents (Tello et al. 2012), particularly given that co-operation and feelings of nurturance promote empathy (Batson et al. 2005; Lanzetta and Englis 1989)"" and that ""masculine competitive environment may inhibit empathic responding to male competitors (Tello et al. 2012)"" as ""competition among males may overrule the influence of characteristics such as similarity and familiarity (Ma et al. 2011), which normally promote empathy (Davis 1994; Preston and De Waal 2002)"".

In [Man up and take it: Gender bias in moral typecasting (Reynolds et al. 2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597820303630?via%3Dihub) it is shown that **people more readily assume female victims and male perpetrators, that people assume that women suffer more pain from their harm, even when women fall in the perpetrator role, see male suffering as more deserved, fair and moral, feel more inclined to punish men and would like to dole out harsher punishments to men, assume more suffering and have more pity for women even in those cases where the real-world discrepancies signal that men have it worse**. Women show a greater bias in almost all of the studies conducted. Also see [Dr. Tania Reynolds' YouTube video about this study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR9tixOJSi0) and [this other video in which she talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6EWA_Wg3xI): ""We did this one study where we manipulated whether a politician was talking about issues that afflict women versus issues that afflict men and all the issues were actually only true for men. Men were less likely to suffer from substance abuse, ... we used all of these issues where actually the data supports that men have it worse. And what we found that when a politician talked about men's issues they saw them as less moral and were less willing to vote for them and wanted to donate less to their political campaigns compared to when they were talking about women's issues. Even though it wasn't even true when they were talking about women's issues. Participants even realized that. It suggests where we have this bias where we care more when women are in the victim role than when men are in the victim role.""

**Quoting from [Dr. Tania Reynolds' article on queermajority.com](https://www.queermajority.com/essays-all/man-up-and-take-it-do-we-under-detect-mens-suffering):**
> ""Through the lens of evolution, such a tendency \[to instinctively cast men in the role of perpetrator and women in the role of victim\] can be associated with reproductive roles. Women set the upper limit on reproduction; all other factors being equal, a group of 10 women and 3 men can produce many more children than a group made up of the opposite gender ratio. With this in mind, it’s not unreasonable to assume that natural selection has favored psychological mechanisms that protect women from harm. If so, our modern minds may possess relics of these asymmetric impulses, attuning our thoughts and emotions to more readily insulate women, relative to men, against peril.""

The author of [Gender Roles and Helping Behavior (Bobbi Hupp-Wilds, 2014)](https://kb.osu.edu/bitstream/handle/1811/60342/Gender_Roles_and_Helping_Behavior.pdf) found:
> \[O\]verall, participants were most likely to help females in dangerous situations, followed by females in emotional situations, males in dangerous situations, and males in emotional situations. As shown in Table 1 males were most likely to help females in dangerous situations, followed by males in dangerous situations, females in emotional situations, and finally males in emotional situations. As shown in Table 1 females were most likely to help females in dangerous situations, followed by females in emotional situations, males in dangerous situations, and finally males in emotional situations. Both male and female participants showed similar helping preferences. Participants were more likely to help in dangerous situations than emotional situations, and **more likely to help females than males**.

In [Gender and Helping Behavior: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Social Psychological Literature (Eagly & Crowley, 1986)](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.4047&rep=rep1&type=pdf), the authors show that ""in general men helped more than women and **women received more help than men**"". This difference of women receiving more help than men was due to men helping women being especially prevalent. Sex differences in helping behaviors such as picking up hitchhikers and helping strangers in subways are especially substantial.

The authors of [The Determinants of Punishment: Deterrence, Incapacitation and Vengeance (Glaeser & Sacerdote, 2000)](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w7676/w7676.pdf) found that ""\[a\]mong vehicular homicides, **drivers who kill women get 56 percent longer sentences [than drivers who kill men]**."" In [Sentencing in Homicide Cases and the Role of Vengeance (Glaeser & Sacerdote, 2003)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/374707), the same authors replicate these findings and find this disparity to be even higher, namely that **drivers who kill women get 59% longer sentences than drivers who kill men**.

In [Cognitive Distortion in Thinking About Gender Issues: Gamma Bias and the Gender Distortion Matrix (Seager & Barry, 2019)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_5), the authors hypothesize about a **""gender distortion matrix""** that suggests an unconscious bias that magnifies gender differences when these differences favor women (alpha bias) and minimizes gender differences when these differences disfavor women (beta bias). Gamma bias, a tendency to magnify some gender differences while minimizing others, combines both alpha and beta bias, which is suggested to be a widespread distortion in modern Western culture whereby **males doing harm is magnified** (""toxic masculinity""), **females doing harm is minimized** (""it's due to trauma""/""she was ill""), **male victimhood is minimized** (male domestic violence victims are overlooked, male suicide victims are overlooked, the fact that being male is the greatest risk factor of dying from COVID-19 after age is ignored, ...), **female victimhood is magnified** (""295 Palestinians, including 42 women and 73 children, were killed by Israeli security forces""), **the privilege of being male is magnified** (men's greater earnings is due to a sexist ""wage gap""), **the privilege of being female is minimized** (it is unremarked that girls get better grades for the same work or that women go to university at a much higher frequency than men), **males doing good things is minimized** (most dirty and dangerous but essential jobs are done by men but this remains unremarked), and **females doing good things is magnified** (a huge number of UN days is reserved to celebrate women for their gender rather than their actions).

The paper [Delta bias in how we celebrate gendertypical traits and behaviours (Seager & Barry, 2020)](https://www.pjp.psychreg.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/seager-barry-168-171.pdf), builds on the theory of gamma bias by introducing a further concept, delta bias. According to the authors:
> Delta bias may be defined as the simultaneous denigration or celebration – depending on the gender of the performer – of an archetypal masculine gender behaviour or characteristic. This is similar to the ‘celebration’ aspect of gamma bias, except that delta bias emphasises how celebration tends to occur where the behaviour is gender atypical.

**Quoting Dr. Elizabeth Hobson from her speech against feminism ([transcript](https://static.j4mb.org.uk/2021/11/190524-transcript-of-Elizabeth-Hobsons-talk-at-Cambridge-Uni.pdf), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IFD4rQIX68))**:
> Before I get stuck into the recorded history of feminism, I need to take a moment to illuminate the biological roots of the movement. Human beings are a gynocentric species – this means that we prioritize the needs and well-being of women over men. This is an evolved instinct that came about as a result of **women being the limiting factor in reproduction** – i.e. women have a much lower ceiling on how many offspring they can physically produce – and in small communities that are subsisting this makes them highly important because they potentially hold the key to whether or not the collective will survive at all. This is why we traditionally send only men to war, this is why we have the “women and children first” Birkenhead Drill, this is why people are more likely to put themselves at risk to save a woman in danger than a man – and it’s why we have feminism. **Feminism has taken our gynocentrism and weaponized it.**
> 
> **Men’s role in this evolutionary sense is to act as a genetic filter** – both to mitigate gene replication errors (ie. Preventing less successful combinations multiplying by barring many men from reproducing) and to produce and retain genetic recombinations that enhance the fitness of offspring. To these ends, male fitness is constantly policed to ensure that women’s standards are met before they gain sexual access – which is why far fewer men than women reproduce. Because the pay-off of carrying particularly successful genes is so much greater for men (women will likely have the opportunity to reproduce if their fitness is moderate, men may well not), **evolution gambles with male genes**. This results in very different **bell curves** for men and women in terms of IQ and physical and psychological health, with men being over-represented at either end of the distribution (particularly intelligent/healthy or unintelligent/unhealthy) and women clustering around the middle. Feminists focus on the apex of male achievement to prove that men enjoy greater success than women (whilst ignoring the biological reasons that catapult a minority of men to the stratosphere) and on the acts of the most malevolent minority of men to generalize their patterns of behavior as emblematic of masculinity (whilst ignoring the fact that the very demographics that preoccupy them show that what is emblematic of masculinity is actually variability).
> 
> So, **human beings have always valued women more than men and been more critical of men than women. These were necessary instincts in tribal communities but they have been manipulated to privilege women to the point of dysfunction** – and this began with the development of proto-feminism, which arose in the late Middle Ages. Queen consort of France and England, Eleanor of Acquitaine spearheaded a movement within her court to subvert the chivalric code (which had traditionally governed relations between knights and lords and the general public) to regulate the behavior of men towards women. These women initiated a system of romantic feudalism wherein noble men were under irresistible pressure to identify a lady as midons (my lord) and to submit to her will and delicately accept any scorn that his midons saw fit to extend to him. Eleanor established Courts of Love in which she and her noble women would administer “justice” in romantic disputes. Not only may many men in particular recognize this state of gender relations – but the modus operandi that Eleanor and co used to achieve their supremacy is entirely familiar: they generalised about all men based on the poor behaviour of a minority, asserting that women needed protection from men’s violations, and they pushed forward a narrative of women’s moral superiority, justifying female dictatorship. Within 200 years, Eleanors’ ideas had spread and saturated throughout Europe and throughout the class system. \[…\]

The study called [Judgments About Male Victims of Sexual Assault by Women: A 35-Year Replication Study (PeConga et al., 2022)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/08862605211062990) is a replication of a 1984 study of college students' judgments about male and female victims of sexual assault carried out by male or female assailants. While the male 2019 cohort was **less** likely to judge that the victim initiated or encouraged the incident and derived pleasure from it, the female cohort was **more** likely to attribute victim encouragement and pleasure to the male victim. The pattern was similar w.r.t. how stressful the event was judged to be for the male victim. The authors ""emphasize the need for greater awareness and empirical attention to abuse that runs counter to preconceived notions about sexual victimization"".

In [Impact of Physician and Patient Gender on Pain Management in the Emergency Department—A Multicenter Study (Safdar, 2009)](https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/10/2/364/1833196) it was shown that ""\[a\]nalgesic administration rates [in the emergency department] were not significantly different for female and male patients (63% vs 57%, P = 0.08)"". However, ""**females presenting with severe pain (NRS ≥8) were more likely to receive analgesics** (74% vs 64%, P = 0.02)"". They also state that this ""was an interesting finding and can be compared with the findings published by Hostetler [33] who studied the administration of IV analgesics (for presumably more severe pain). Of 114,207 adults and 43,725 pediatric patients, females were 1.7 times more likely to receive parenteral analgesics (CI 1.4–2)"".

The authors of [Gender and aggression I: Perceptions of aggression (Harris & Knight-Bohnhoff, 1996)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01548172) show that people are particularly intolerant of male-to-female aggression:
> Consistent with previous research on gender and aggression, both studies found that the aggressor, target, and respondent all affected perceptions of aggression and likelihood of aggressive behaviors. **Aggression from a male and aggression directed towards a female were particularly likely to be evaluated negatively.**

According to [Police Perceptions of Rape as Function of Victim Gender and Sexuality (Davies, 2009)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1350/pojo.2009.82.1.466), UK police responds more negatively toward hypothetical male rape victims than hypothetical female rape victims.

In [Predicting rape empathy based on victim, perpetrator, and participant gender, and history of sexual aggression. (Osman, 2011)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-06053-005), it is shown that **people were more empathetic towards female than male rape victims**, that they were also **more empathetic towards female rapists than male rapists** (particularly when their victim was male), and that **people were more empathetic towards the perpetrator when the rape victim was male**. Men without victimization experience were relatively non-empathic with a male victim.

The authors of [Evaluations of sexual assault: perceptions of guilt and legal elements for male and female aggressors using various coercive strategies (Russell et al., 2011)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22288097/) show that **college students who were provided with legal instructions of sexual assault and then asked to provide a verdict, degree of guilt, and legal components attribute less guilt to a female-on-male sexual aggressor than a male-on-female sexual aggressor**.

In [Attitudes of Dutch citizens towards male victims of sexual coercion by a female perpetrator (Huitema & Vanwesenbeeck, 2016)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13552600.2016.1159343) it was shown that **male victims of sexual coercion are not taken as seriously as female victims of sexual coercion**, especially among Dutch men. The authors argue that the findings highlight the importance of educational programmes to raise awareness and reduce stereotypical views on male sexual victimisation.

In [Attitudes about victims of workplace sexual harassment based on sex (Cesario, 2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666518220300061) the author finds that **male sexual harassment victims are viewed as suffering less than female victims** and that ""\[f\]indings of this study have strong implications for workplace policy and practice"".

In [The Reverse Double Standard in Perceptions of Student-Teacher Sexual Relationships: The Role of Gender, Initiation, and Power (Howell, 2011)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224540903510837) it was found that ""**participants judged situations [of sexual relations between students and teachers] involving male teachers more harshly than they judged situations involving female teachers**, but only when the sexual contact was teacher-initiated. Participants also believed that male students received more social benefits from the sexual contact than did female students"".

In [National Baseline Study on Violence against Children (Philippines EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, 2016)](https://www.unicef.org/philippines/media/491/file/National%20Baseline%20Study%20on%20Violence%20Against%20Children%20in%20the%20Philippines:%20Results%20(executive%20summary).pdf) it is shown that **boys are at least as or more vulnerable than girls to all forms of violence**. Particularly, when it comes to _severe physical_ violence, boys are almost twice as likely to experience it (4.0% for boys vs 2.2% for girls). Perhaps most surprisingly, males were found to experience sexual violence more frequently than females overall (24.7% for boys vs 18.2% for females). It is also noteworthy that the lifetime-prevalence seems to underestimate the greater abuse suffered by boys, and it is thus preferable to look at the 12-month prevalence where available. You may find [Recall Bias can be a Threat to Retrospective and Prospective Research Designs (Hassan, 2005)](https://print.ispub.com/api/0/ispub-article/13060) and [Has ‘lifetime prevalence’ reached the end of its life?

See this YouTube video with the title [Karen Straughan in The Red Pill on Boko Haram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD3PqQfwgaY) which illustrates our lack of empathy on a cultural level. Boko Haram kidnapped over 10,000 boys and made them into child soldiers compared to the 276 girls they kidnapped which created a public uproar with slogans like ""Bring Back our Girls"". Not just that but they were even entering schools and outright killing the male students and keeping the female students alive. Yet, there was no news coverage for the same issue affecting boys. When everything is set up to make it look like women have it worse then obviously many people are going to believe that.

**Quoting William Collins from his book [The Empathy Gap: Male Disadvantages and the Mechanisms of Their Neglect](https://www.amazon.com/Empathy-Gap-Disadvantages-Mechanisms-Neglect/dp/0957168888)**:
> The empirical evidence for an empathy gap against males, associated with a widespread gynocentric orientation, is overwhelmingly strong. It is remarkable that this remains imperceptible to the general public, and to feminists in particular. The reason is gynocentrism itself, which promotes its own invisibility. Key evolved traits are generally motivated in the individual by emotions. One does not consciously eat in order to fulfil the evolutionary function of remaining a viable organism until genetic transmittal has been accomplished. One eats because one is hungry. But, in truth, the latter is the trick that evolution plays upon one in order to accomplish the former objective. Hunger, and the pleasure of eating, are proximate causes of a behaviour whose distal origin is successful genetic promulgation. In the same way, there is a complex of emotions which promotes the pair bond. 
> 
> Evolved matricentrism is enacted by those same emotions which drive the pair bond. This includes, for example, the key element of the ceding of moral authority to mothers, and by extension to women in general. One of the associated correlates of this moral authority is men's discomfort at female disapproval. The veil which has obscured this matricentrism is the traditional patriarchy which the feminists are so intent on smashing. The societal respect which patriarchy embodied hid, and hence made tolerable to men, the underlying matricentric subservience. As matricentrism has intensified into feminist gynocentrism, and the veil of respect for men has been withdrawn, another mechanism of obscuration has become necessary. This is the doctrine of female oppression and poisonous masculinity. For most people now, this new perspective on the sexes serves very effectively to hide gynocentrism. But it is a step too far. One cannot sweeten the pill by making it more bitter still. Some people are now rejecting a pill so bitter that it requires service to those who will continue to despise you. Matricentrism was never truly invisible to the  inquiring mind, more of an invisibility of convenience. And gynocentrism can be, and is being, perceived and resisted by many people, of both sexes. For women, resisting gynocentric tendencies may be equated with the responsible use of their power, motivated by the recognition of feminism's corrosive effects. \[…\]",lightning_palm,t2_7exrq0w2,0.97,107,33

224,glq6he,2020-05-17,MensRights,Concern on gender roles and feminism. Does anyone else see this as a potential issue?,"Men's  Lib, and to some extent MRAs, have been advocating for men to abandon traditional masculinity on the grounds that it is constraining and men should be free to pursue what they want, not just what society tells them is good.

In a vacuum, I think this is great. Men shouldn't be forced into a role there is no longer a need for. Although I haven't researched it, it seems plausible that following what we want to do is one of the better ways to live a happy and fulfilling life.

My concern is that we don't live in a vacuum, and coupling this with the feminist movement will ultimately lead men to be forced into a role in which we  have no choice, power or value. Here's why:

The feminist movement has been pushing for women to be strong, independent, pursue financial success and climb the career ladder. Women who choose  not to do this are vilified. To be clear, women working and achieving is just fine--they should have the same right to a job we do.

We also know that leaving the traditional men's role means men are incentivized to do almost anything that *doesn't* focus on career success.

We  know humans respond to incentives (see Freakonomics ch.1 and tons of  behavioral psychology literature), and we know the incentives are now  tied to women working and succeeding and men doing anything except that.

Results of a [recent LinkedIn study](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/diversity/2019/how-women-find-jobs-gender-report) which showed women were 16-18% more likely to to get jobs they apply for than men, women [make up the majority](https://time.com/5766787/women-workforce/) of the workforce now and get the majority of university degrees at all levels.

Given  these trends, it is increasingly likely men will have a harder time finding a decent paying job compared to their spouse and will be relegated, by lack of a better option, to being homemakers. This is [already happening](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/24/stay-at-home-moms-and-dads-account-for-about-one-in-five-u-s-parents/),  over the last 25 years, the number of men staying home has almost doubled from 4% to 7%, and the number who are staying home ostensibly to take care of kids and family has risen by 1,300% (no thats not a typo).

We also know that what we see around us helps influence our cultural norms, and that children are [much more likely](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/learning/will-you-follow-in-your-parents-footsteps.html)  to take after their parents in career choice. However, this is largely  true for roles which are culturally seen in either a positive or neutral  light culturally.

As a result, it  seems likely to me that feminism's enforcement of success and promotion  of women at work and the fact that men have a harder time getting  degrees and finding jobs, coupled with a lack of social support for men  focusing on a career will ultimately not lead to equality, but rather  men falling into a norm of being homemakers. If the current rate of  increase holds, we are about 90 years from seeing men stay home at a  rate last seen [for women in the 1960s](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2014/beyond-bls/stay-at-home-mothers-through-the-years.htm).

When  women were homemakers, society largely dictated that it was the man's  job to provide for his family and take care of them. Feminism holds no  such notion about how women should treat men and generally argues the  opposite. Although it is all anecdotal, if you read stories of men who  married spouses who significantly out-earned them, abuse was common. The  expectation from the woman was often ""my money, my rules"". I see no  sign of this changing.

Assuming  trends hold, in 90 years this means men who are homemakers are very  likely to have little say in what happens in the family or their own  lives, receive little recognition for the work they do, and have no  social support for seeking other roles. We have already seen how long it  took women to escape this.

As a  result, I am very concerned that by virtue of ending social norms of men  succeeding at work, we are setting up future men for a society which  will develop oppressive norms and treatment toward the role of men.

But we are now at the point where the deck is stacked against males at every stage of their lives and in almost every major institution.   

When a male is born he can have his genitals mutilated. Hundreds of baby boys die from this procedure every year.

Then comes primary school, where boys are often punished and even drugged for displaying natural boyish behavior. Recent studies have also revealed that female teachers mark down boys by an average of 20 percent for the same work.

Huge numbers of boys are now being raised without fathers (including about 99 percent of school shooters, funny how we never talk about that), and since pedo hysteria has chased male teachers out of primary school, boys often don't have any male role models until much later in life.

Boys only clubs (eg the Boy Scouts) are being eliminated while girl only clubs remain.

Teenage boys are being introduced to blatantly misandrist concepts like ""toxic masculinity,"" with narry a word about toxic femininity and nothing about the positive aspects of masculinity.

Next it's off to University, where there are a range of female-specific scholarships and programs even though women make up the majority of college students and young women are now out-earning young men. They are also portrayed as rapists in waiting, and there are entire departments (gender studies) devoted to demonizing their sex. If a young man pisses off a young woman (eg dumps her after a one night stand) he faces the possibility of being subjected to a false accusation and a feminist Kangaroo court. Then it's bye bye academic career and social reputation.

If he wants to vote he will have to sign over his body to the state (selective service).

If he gets a woman pregnant he will not have the option of legal parental surrender. While a woman can just drop off the baby at a safe haven, the man is on the hook for 18 years of child support and will be locked up if he loses his job and can't pay.

In the workplace things are just as bad. Men perform almost all of the dirty and dangerous jobs and make up 95 percent of workplace injuries and deaths. If a white man wants to pursue a more respected career he faces racial and sexual discrimination in hiring due to corporate ""diversity"" measures and quotas. A recent study in...I think it was Australia found that ""blind hiring"" practices (where the employer doesn't know the race or sex of the applicant) result in more straight white males being hired; this means that it is straight white men who are now suffering discrimination in the workplace.

With MeToo, a man can be fired from his job simply for making a woman uncomfortable. There have even been cases of men being fired for telling a naughty joke.

If he gets married and the wife divorces him through no fault of his own he will likely be treated like shit by the family courts unless he can afford a high priced lawyer. There are countless stories of men effectively being turned into indentured servants by their ex-wives; they live in poverty and seldom see their kids while the wife gets a new ""baby daddy"" and lives high on the hog. NOW, the largest feminist organization in the world, continues to oppose shared parenting even though every single study shows it to be in the best interests of the children, the father and even the mother.

He will receive less social support, less health care spending, and be relentlessly demonized in the media. 

If a male is sexually assaulted by a woman he will probably not receive justice; the perp will likely get a slap on the wrist even if the victim is a boy.  

If he commits a crime or is falsely accused of a crime he will be treated much, much more harshly by the criminal justice system.

I could go on.

It is a myth that feminists think the sexes are equal. Their MO goes like this: if men are ahead in some area, that means women are being oppressed because the sexes are identical except for genitalia; however, if women are ahead in some area that's because women are superior. You can find this sentiment going back to the first wave. Elizabeth Cady Stanton claimed that women are ""infinitely superior"" to men.

The prison thing is perhaps the most glaring example of feminists not practicing what they preach. If they were serious about equality they would be demanding either that men be treated with more compassion/leniency or that women be treated more harshly (or some combination of the two). Instead, they want women to be treated even *more* leniently, and some are even advocating for the complete abolition of female prisons.

Men are increasingly second class citizens not only in a social but legal sense. A study in the UK determined that if women were treated like men by the criminal justice system, fully half of all prisoners would be female. Women do NOT commit less crimes than men (though they do commit less homicides), they just don't get punished to anywhere near the same extent.

If feminism were an ""equality"" movement they would not be trying to privilege females in every single institution.    They would be looking with a keen eye at areas in which males are disadvantaged and/or subject to institutional discrimination.   They certainly wouldn't blame everything on some nebulous all-encompassing ""patriarchy"" that hasn't even been proven to exist.

Women are getting equal consideration for jobs, they are getting equal (biased) hiring into jobs. We all know someone who have said ""a friend of mine was flat out told they had to hire the other person"" and we've all seen the huge divided between hard and soft skills.

So  How do these women claim they don't need men ? Answer is simple. Their lifestyle or things they take for granted  like security, infrastructure etc which allows them to work in pencil pushing jobs  were all funded by taxes extracted by govt.

 Guess what even in the most egalatarian Nordic  countries  taxes are majorly contributed by men and social safety net primarily used by women. This parisitic operation is blindsiding women from valuing men.

Thus instead of progressive percentage based slab , a fixed amount of tax must be stipulated equally for all regardless of gender ! If some of them are not working then they can get a sponsor to pay that for them .

All too often we hear that the MRA NEEDS feminism. I say poppycock. Feminism not only steers clear of men and father's issues, it downright actively battles against them. 

Time and time again we hear about how women's groups and feminists rally together to fight against any and all legislation to reform child custody and alimony laws. 

Here are but a few exmaples:

[Women’s rights groups to rally in Tally against alimony bill](http://floridapolitics.com/archives/206474-womens-rights-groups-host-statewide-media-conference-sb-668)

and 


[NOW feminists opposed the Florida alimony child care reform bill ](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/statutes/2015/61.08)


The FL bill, btw, was not to completely eliminate alimony or even lifetime alimony, but to simply put in place fixed rules for the setting of alimony.


The bill also was to start child custody from a 50/50 position rather than from a female advantage. Feminists fought and succeeded in keeping in place the current system of judicial whim. That's a case of feminists vehemently fighting against a bill that would make alimony more ""fair.""

And for anyone needing sources to battle against the claim that while the courts and legislation aren't moving fast enough, women across the world are objecting to alimony itself:

[Here's this](http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-08-03/news/fl-alimony-reform-women-20130731_1_first-wives-first-alimony-reform-alimony-law)

[And this](https://www.bustle.com/articles/124399-the-womens-rights-issue-you-might-not-know-about-but-definitely-should)

The latter is particularly entertaining, as the Schadenfreude is particularly thick:

>In the 1979 case of Orr v. Orr, the Supreme Court ruled that alimony regulations must affect women and men equally, invalidating the rule that men must pay alimony to women, but not vice-versa. But women paying alimony to men is still fairly uncommon, and in such cases, it's difficult to make sure that these women are being treated fairly. Many women advocating for alimony reform don't want to make payments to their ex-husbands, which they see as an unfair burden. ""There's no other contract where the liability continues after the contract ends,"" Tanya Williams, who has paid alimony to her ex-husband for 13 years, told Reuters. ""You can't leave your job and say, 'I still have a need, so you have to continue to pay me.'""

Bottom line: Women like it when they receive alimony. They fight to keep in place a system where they receive alimony. Women don't like it when they are required to pay alimony and fight to change the system when they are the ones burdened by it. They fight to change it even when men make up just 3-5% of all alimony recipients.


[When 3-5% of men in divorces receive alimony, yet 40% of households are headed by female breadwinners](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmajohnson/2014/11/20/why-do-so-few-men-get-alimony/#6f0a60c754b9)

do you honestly think that women and feminist are lining up to end these archaic and demeaning constructs? The answer is absolutely not. 

As a side note:


I am often reminded of this little number (a little number we are all too familiar with, btw) when the claim rears its head:

238,odgfb,2012-01-12,MensRights,"""Women get 72 cents on the dollar for the same work as men"". How many feminists know this is a lie?","First of all, just so you know where I am coming from I'm male and very left wing and a critic of feminism.  I like feminists; I just think they are wrong.  If you're not willing to accept criticism of feminism then you know... trigger warning for feminists who can't stand anyone disagreeing with them.  

Now I'm 100% for equality and that's my problem with feminism.  Obviously it is not 100% for equality.  We all know plenty of examples of feminist bigots so let's not go over that ground.  A more interesting question for me, and the one I am aiming at here is what sort of proportion of feminists are man hating bigots and what proportion are just sexist people that tolerate bigotry in others and what sort of proportion are naively clueless about just how nasty the rest of the movement is and actually support equality like I do?  Other classifications could exist.  My point is that not all feminists are the same.  I think we can agree there?

Before I get too far I should clarify that this is NOT a question about the gender gap per se.  I am asking a question about the character of the feminist movement.  People have different views on what feminism is.  Some people think it is a hate movement (me).  Other people say it is an equality movement.  Who knows, right?  Nobody ""represents"" feminism I've been told, so there's no way to tell the truth.

But then it struck me that maybe you could tell the difference if eg. you discovered that most feminists like to spread lies that tend to make women hate men.  Given those two conflicting hypotheses you would expect quite different results.  If feminism was a hate movement you'd expect a large proportion of feminists to behave that way.  If feminism was an equality movement such behaviour would be an aberration.

And so I test.  I ask feminists about the gender wage gap not because I care about that per se (well I do but separately) but to see how many will tell me false information, that women get paid 72 cents on the dollar for the same work as men.  Almost all do.  Then I have to follow up and ask if they know what  they said was untrue.  And about 80% do.  But it has been a while since I've asked a lot so I wondered if anything had changed.

Now before you get going on some statistics about relative pay and all that STOP.  I don't care (for the purposes of this question).  This is not a question about the gender wage gap.  I know all that stuff thanks.  I know feminists like to say all that stuff about how women get pushed into lower paying jobs and discrimination in hiring practices.  I know the MRA side of it too (not an MRA myself).  That's not my question.

But I am going to have to address it anyways of course.

""Gee David, I am a feminist who sincerely believes that women get screwed on wages because they are pressured into lower paying jobs, or because of hiring discrimination or because traditional ""women's jobs"" get paid less.  I really honestly do think that and it's no lie, but I know that won't impress anyone.  I know I can't put that in a five second slogan.  I know nobody is going to get too upset about me saying ""women get paid less than men for completely different work"".  So I tell a white lie.  I say ""women get paid less for the exact same work"".  I know that's not true.  I know that 72 cents figure comes from averaging ALL men and ALL women full time workers.  I know it is comparing (for example) a male surgeon with a female bus driver, and I know it is completely dishonest to do that and call it ""equal work"".  But I really think women get screwed.  A bit less.  So it's not really a lie is it?  Not much of one.""

So I hope my question is clear now.  I assume every feminist here has heard the 72 cents thing before.  It's not always 72 cents.  Might be 75, 78, 69.  Equal pay day site says 77 cents.  Whatever.  You've all heard it.  How many of you know it is a lie?  How many of you repeat it anyway?  and how many of you have never heard that it is a lie?

I stumbled upon this article which mentions how multiple ""gender experts"" are puzzled by how in more feminist countries women participate less in STEM and have even fewer executive positions.

The source of this paradox is a fundamental misunderstanding of why women don't prefer these positions and roles in the first place.

It's simple, these experts have it completely backwards. Rather than women being ""oppressed"" out of STEM, and well paying jobs. The contrary is true, men are oppressed into these jobs.

It is a proven fact that exiting the labor force and being a housewife is highly profitable. Based on BLS data the average woman becomes legally entitled to 125% of the ""pay gap"" through being a housewife, and studies have shown that women spend money on themselves far more than they are legally entitled to, averaging up to 170% of the ""pay gap"".

It is also a proven fact that STEM gives people the least amount of societal privilege. In all school subjects and in hiring women are treated more favorably than men across the board compared to their merit, but they receive less advantage to their privilege in STEM. There are hundreds of studies confirming this. If you therefore privilege women more, roles based on merit become even less attractive to women.

The results here shouldn't be paradoxical at all. If more inequality happens because you increase female privilege, that is a clear indication that the inequality isn't harmful to women, it's harmful to men. Giving women privilege is why you have the inequality in the first place, and the inequality is a source of superiority, not hardship. Extensive data absolutely proves this is the case. This isn't even slightly an opinion.

I'm really not sure why these ""experts"" never stopped to consider that men could possibly be the more oppressed gender, and that if they wanted to reduce inequality they key is to support men, not women.",Accomplished_GoalY,t2_9sdwir14,0.98,194,37

is a very proud feminist. I am the only male in the class. This is a small college so she is teaching the entire program. The man bashing was getting out of hand and I had enough. So I wrote her this email regarding some of my issues in the class:

Hello R\*\*\*,

I am not happy in your classes. I feel that it is the duty of the instructor to present the material as unbiased as possible, and as a proud feminist you do not do that. These issues are not new, I have been feeling this way for a long time. However, it was on Wednesday of last week that I reached my breaking point. In my twenties I may have identified as a feminist, but I’ve grown since. I do not support the feminist ideology. I believe in equal rights, but “woke feminism” is a joke at best, and very dangerous at its worst. I realize that you are very passionate about your feminist beliefs, but I am not, and I do not want to hear it in the classroom any longer. I have requested several times to transfer to another class however B\*\*\*\*\*n is not responding to my emails. I can no longer sit quietly on this. Until they can find another class for me to join, I will be joining your lectures, but I will do minimal participation. I will not answer questions, and my camera will be off. Topics such as mansplaining, manspreading and the pay gap are non-issues. Mansplaining is a feminist tactic to silence men, manspreading is due to biology, the pay gap is due to the difference choices that men and women make. To pay someone differently for the same job with the same qualifications is illegal and every time they look for it in the West, they repeatedly find men as the underpaid gender, if it exists at all. Just look at what happened with women’s soccer in the US and the BBC in the UK. There is no Patriarchy, just a hierarchy based upon competence, with the most competent rising to the top. And that is just the tip of the iceberg.

Feminism is an ideology based upon victimhood and I will not be a part of that belief system.

It is because I like and respect you that I am writing this email. If it was not for that, I would not have returned.

One last point, men make up 95% of war casualties. The ones that do survive are traumatized, disfigured and never the same. To say that women and children are the biggest victims of war, was deeply offensive. If one considers all people as equals and you can still regard women and children as the biggest victims of war, something is very wrong with your reasoning. Most of those men that died; died protecting our borders so we can be safe and enjoy our lives in peace. Do not discredit their sacrifices. None of them wanted to die, but that was the cost of our freedom.

Sincerely,

88888 8888888

My professor's reply was sent through Bongo. Our classes are all online. I didn't realize that Bongo does not automatically save private messages. The gist of her reply was that she apologized for making me feel uncomfortable in class and she wants to talk with me face to face about my issues with the class. I actually have a good relationship with the professor. I do have the support of all the students in the classroom. The day of the incident where she was particularly man bashing I commented that there was ""too much man hating going on"". The rest of the class either apologized or came to my defense. I really like my classmates. I then went completely silent for the rest of the week and did not join her class.

Instead, maybe playing up to their preconceptions will finally be able to nail the truth into their heads.

Men are physically stronger and resilient to the environment. A man is better equipped than a woman to survive alone in the wild. He can go to a piece of raw land, clear it, farm it, and build a house on it with his own hands. As recently as 100 years ago men did exactly that. But what he cannot do is birth and rear children. That has been women's primary contribution to civilization. But to achieve the conditions suitable for child birthing and rearing, a woman had to get protection and provision by a man, by giving him love.

But recently women don't seem to think that they need men. Actually, they do depend on men, but **the government has come in between**, and make men contribute essential services to the country. The military draft is an example. Men are forced to protect the country, when the women who receive that protection don't have to give anything in return. The same goes for other critical services that men provide. Feminists try to maximize these benefits women receive for free by wanting more 'rights' (the right to protection, freedom, shelter etc.), but not caring about the conditions of those who provides those rights. If not for the protection provided by men, feminism wouldn't even exist. Also there is this biological effect called the gender empathy gap, where people do not have any empathy for men, but have empathy for women and children. So the men in the modern society have become slaves of sorts, slaving their lives away in the hopes of getting love and a family, but not succeeding.

**So when the social contract has been breached, and when the men don't receive what they are looking for in return for what they provide, it is time or men to stop contributing.**

There are several ways that governments make men obsolete.

1. The innate male characteristics a man brought to a relationship has been replaced with jobs, such as military, police, sanitation, construction etc. that provide essential services such as protection and provision. Before, when a man provided these services to a woman he was given mating opportunities directly. Now he gets a salary when he provides it to society, which may or may not be his ultimate goal. Furthermore, the men providing some of these essential services (sanitation for example) are seen by women as lower breeding stock (because they are not doctors, lawyers etc.).
2. Using tax revenue to provide essential services that men would have otherwise provided, such as protection from threats (military, police), housing (section 8), transport etc. The men are replaced by the taxes they pay. If not for the government that provides these benefits using tax revenue, a woman would have had to find and keep a man to get the same benefits.
3. Alimony and uncapped (beyond what is needed to raise a child) child support, that forces the man to keep providing financially even after divorce/separation.
4. Giving women undeserved special treatment in the form of female only scholarships, job quotas, affirmative action, paid maternity/menstrual leave etc. Females in physical jobs such as military, police, firefighting etc. have reduced physical standards they have to meet (therefore are less effective), but get the same amount of pay (how is this equal pay for equal work?).

&#x200B;

I suggest men do the following to counter these, respectively.

1. Do not work in the aforementioned critical services, especially if you're a male who is unsuccessful at mating. If a female wants those services, she can mate with you. If you are providing those services to a female who is not mating with you, you are simping. As less men engage in these jobs, the importance of men will go up, because they are needed. For example, if a woman can't find security because there is only female police, who have less physical strength than male police, she will have to find a man who will provide her that protection.
2. Find ways to pay less taxes, especially if you're a male unsuccessful at mating. There are ways to legally pay less taxes, such as becoming more self sufficient, growing your own food, fixing your own house and equipment, bartering instead of buying, being self employed, working under the table, using tax breaks as a farmer, moving to Puerto Rico and using act 20/22/60, working as a digital nomad, working in or emigrating to a country that has a lower tax rate, etc. Working a high wage salaried job causes you to pay to most taxes, and the money you yourself make will go towards replacing you.
3. Do not sign a marriage contract, and if you are in the US, only have children in default-equal-custody states such as KY and WV. Otherwise you will lose your children, and pay child support for children you cannot see. Having children by buying an egg and paying a surrogate mother also minimizes the risk of losing them.
4. Do not work in a job that give women undeserved special treatment. You are not being paid fairly for how much you work. Someone has to make up for the work that the freeloaders are skipping, and it's you. Leave these jobs, and the freeloaders will have no option but to work to prevent to the whole company from going down. Someone has to do the work. For example, take the military. Females in the military have lower physical standards, but get paid the same. Now let's suppose that, realizing this, all the males quit. Who is going to carry the 120lb rucks, move heavy equipment, move to contact with the enemy, etc.? Who is going to do the actual work? The military will have no option but to pay the men higher for what they are worth. The same applies for a corporate job where the women get paid maternity or menstrual leave, but the males do not.

&#x200B;

**Basically, as women become more selfish and self-centered, men should also become more selfish and more self-centered**. Otherwise you end up being exploited.

**How do I recommend men make a living in order to prevent the government from exploiting them in the above 4 ways? Become a homesteader/farmer and move away from the cities**. You do not have to do this immediately. Rather, it's a process that you can do slowly over a long time.

Modern cities rely on male labor to a high extent. Sanitation workers, police, construction, mechanics etc. A female crew of construction workers just can't put out the same amount of work a male crew can. But these workers are paid less and have lower status in society. So it's getting harder and harder for them to find a partner and have a family. So living in a city is not working out for them anyway.

Since city life is not working out for them anyway, they should move out and start homesteading. Not all at once. Let's take a male who works in a city. First of all, he can save rent by living with his parents. He saves some money and buys some land 3 hours away. Cheaper because in the middle of the boonies. If there is a broken down house it's better. He can park a camper there to live in. During the weekends he goes there and starts converting it to his homestead. Builds a cabin, or puts a mobile home there, or repairs the broken down house that is already there. Makes a little farm, and starts selling produce at the farmer's market. Buys used batteries and solar panels. Digs a well. Little by little he builds his little kingdom that he can go away to. In the city he is at the bottom of society. But in his land he is king. He learns and gathers equipment to live off the land more and more, and eventually leaves the city and moves to the countryside full time, taking a job in the countryside. He has gone from a high taxed city existence to a more self-reliant existence in the countryside. The city has lost a worker. If he keeps increasing the profit he makes from his farm, he can quit his job and become a self reliant farmer.

I'm halfway through this process now. I have a property and a broken down house, which I bought for very cheap, 3 hours away from a major city. I'm still working at the city, but experimenting with growing produce and locally selling, and also fixing the house when I can. When I start making enough profit from my farm, I will quit my job in the city and find a low demand, low pay job near my farm (or do something like Uber, Doordash or Instacart) and concentrate more on the farm, until I'm living completely off the farm. Later, as I make more profit, I can go to Puerto Rico and use Act 20/22/60 to pay zero taxes. If I meet a suitable woman I will go to Kentucky before I have children. Paying to have a child through a surrogate is not entirely out of the question, if I manage to make enough money.

I started out being depressed with city life and the self-entitled women that were available there as mating opportunities. As I started working more in the homestead, I became less stressed, less depressed and started enjoying life. It is great to wake up with the sun, be outside, experience the sunlight and the wind, smell the grass and the soil, and watch my produce grow. I am also learning to hunt and fish, and got my first deer recently, which took care of my meat needs for quite a while. This is not the easiest life, but it is a cause to fight for. Men enjoy doing hard things, and it is a great feeling to know that I'm minimizing the ways my enemies can exploit me.

All the lower status male physical workers in cities should do this. They are not getting much sex or a family in the city anyway, and they are moving to an environment where they are in their element, being self reliant against nature. If the city wants to keep them, they'll have to pay more.

Actually, all men should do this if they can. Because this is where the average male is in his element. Communal city living is for feminists, where,  because of so called 'equity', a weaker female construction worker get's paid the same as a strong male construction worker who does twice the work.

When looking for mates, follow the red-pill truths (refer Rollo Tomassi etc). Realize that there are no soulmates. Increase the pool of candidates, by using social media and also by looking in other countries. Do not put maximum effort on one woman. Instead put minimum effort on maximum number of women, and choose based on how they reciprocate. Keep multiple options, just the way women do it. Do not commit to a woman until she shows that she is willing to put effort in to the relationship. This is the most efficient way. Otherwise, from my experience, you will end up just simping and having nothing to show for it. As women reach the end of their biological clock, they will try to find someone to settle with. The woman you get will most probably have a high body count and be less able to pair-bond. That is even more reason to earn less money, and collect non-transferrable wealth, in terms of talent, experience etc., so the family courts can't take it away from you. Since marriage contracts always favor the lower earner, only sign a marriage contract if the woman makes more money than you, and file for immediate divorce if she stops earning. Since the feminists dislike gender roes, you can be a great house-husband who can fix things around the house. As the tradesmen become rarer and more expensive as the males quit, being handy around the house will be more attractive to women. Since her income is more that yours, if she cheats you can file for divorce and take the money that she earned.

When society refuses to listen to the problems of men and continue to exploit men, **this is a non-violent method of advocating for yourself**. There is no reason to openly talk about this. Keep it silent, to the degree that you are comfortable with. The aim is not to be a loser, but to be a winner who doesn't let anyone take advantage of your work, and reciprocate ONLY to those who help you. **You are not entitled to love and sex, but at the same time, society is not entitled to your labor, or the protection that you provide.**",jacare_o,t2_14fj8j,0.74,23,25
251,ylfw9j,2022-11-03,MensRights,"Men too should be free to exercise their right to choose. Because fatherhood (not just motherhood) should be a choice too and no one, man or woman, should be coerced into parenthood.","Men too should be free to exercise their right to choose. Because fatherhood (not just motherhood) should be a choice too and no one, man or woman, should be coerced into parenthood. 

I'm a woman, I'm Center-Left in my values but for the most par I'm non-partisan or independent, and I support a man's right to choose. I support the right of both genders to choose. I have two nephews and I want them to have the right to choose, the right to make that decision for themselves and not some fucked up radical-Right or radical-Left person making that choice for them.

A lot of people online (including Youtube and Reddit) are talking about how Herschel Walker pressured women to have abortions and threatened the lives of some of them if they did not do as he said and how those women came forward to denounce him and how it's evil and wrong to interfere with a woman's choice and that she alone should get to decide whether or not she wants to get an abortion.

Here's my position on things like this:

The woman should decide if she gets an abortion or not because it's in her body. But if she chooses not to get an abortion, if she choose to keep the baby, then she's the one who should pay for the baby because it's NOT okay to punish a man for a WOMAN'S choice, especially when he does NOT have a say in her choice. If a woman can opt out of parenthood and get an abortion or give up the baby for adoption and not have motherhood forced on her and no one can force her to get an abortion or stop her from getting one, then a man should also have the right to opt out of parenthood and just like women say ""my consent to sex is not consent to parenthood, I don't want to be financially responsible for a child, I'm not ready to be a dad"", especially if said male is a teen and under the age of 18. 

A man should also be sexually liberated and not have to raise a child and pay child support just because he had sex, just like you can't force a woman to carry to term and have a baby just because she had sex. Her body, her choice, right? Well, his wallet, his choice. Now THAT is real equality, men shouldn't be coerced any more than women are. She's the one who chose to keep the baby, so she should pay for the child, because it was HER choice, NOT his. So she should show people how much of a strong, independent woman she is and she should have to get a job and save money to provide for the baby that SHE chose to keep and she should not be able to sue the man for child support and be taken seriously because that violates the man's right to choose, the man's freedom to choose. Suing a man for child support is like sewing a woman for getting an abortion, it's suing someone for exercise their RIGHT TO CHOOSE and it's punishing someone JUST BECAUSE THEY HAD SEX.

I'm pro-choice for both genders. Men shouldn't be coerced into fatherhood any more than women should be coerced into motherhood. Women shouldn't be forced into getting an abortion nor should they be denied an abortion just because they had sex. And men should not be forced to become fathers and pay child support just because they had sex. In both instances, you're punishing someone for the so-called ""crime"" of engaging in sexual acrivitieS and in both instances, you're trying to take away someone's right to choose, someone's freedom of choice. The Left say that the Conservatives telling women that if they have sex they're better be prepared to have babies is punishing women for engaging in sex and that the people who say that flat out admit that they view pregnancy and childbirth as punishment for sex, then they need to admit once and for all that forcing a man to be a father, to pay child support, to be financially responsible for a child is punishing men for engaging in sex. Either both genders are sexually liberated or neither are. But we can't have this double standard. It's evil, inconsistant and wrong. 

I have two little nephews age 8 and 6 and when they become adults, I don't want them to be punished with a baby and child support that they do not want just because they engaged in sexual activities. If I had nieces instead of nephews, I would have the same position because I'm a gender Egalitarian and I'm fucking consistant like that, I wouldn't want them to be denied abortion rights just because they engaged in sexual acitivities. If both parents don't want the child, then the foster care or adoptive family should pay for the child. But women need to support equal rights for men and boys, (the right of men and boys to be treated the same as women and girls and having the same right to sexual liberation and opting out of parenthood that women and girls have), that males should also have the right to opt out of parenthood and to not be punished with a baby and child support for engaging in sex and I'm not even talking about alimony and all that shit. 

Women can show society that they're strong independent women by working and providing for the babies THEY choose to keep and not financially drain their exes (for child support) until they commit suicide like what happened with Robin Williams who killed himself because he was depressed and had mental health issues as a result of having to cope with like 5 of his exes financially draining him for child support and alimony and a court system that's biased against men and want men to be PUNISHED FOR HAVING SEX (it was the WOMAN'S choice to keep the baby, NOT his choice), that's not equality, that's not being a strong and independent woman who take responsibility for HER choice to keep the baby, that's not being pro-choice for the man who shouldn't be punished for having sex just like a woman shouldn't be punished for having sex. Men too should be free to exercise their right to choose whether or not they want to be parents and whether or not they want to be financially responsible for a child, and NEITHER GENDERS SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR HAVING SEX. It's as simple as that.

Also, misandrist shit like this make me so angry, they even go after men who were statutory raped as underaged children (12, 13, 14 years old) by female teachers for child support and pressuring them into fatherhood:

I don't ever want something like that to happen to my nephews and I will fight to my dying breath for their right to opt out of parenthood because they shouldn't be punished for having been sexually assaulted or for having consensual sex any more than a woman should be. 

Also the condom can break and the pill can fail, so adult men (age 18+) are punished even when they use protection to the best of their ability and society put all the pressure and the responsibility for protection/contraception on the man despite the fact that women have far many more contraception options than men, because men only have condoms and women can poke holes in men's condoms and sabotage the men's condoms to get pregnant from the men without their consent and then sue the men for child support after the women choose to keep the baby, that's something that happened to my own cousin. It has got to stop.

When a woman get an abortion or give up the baby for adoption because she wants to focus on her career and she doesn't want to raise kids and be financially responsible for kids, she's called liberated, a liberated woman who exercise her freedom to choose. If a man wants to do the same thing, if HE wants to be child free and he doesn't want to be punished with a baby and child support for having sex, if he doesn't want to be financially responsible after he had sex with a woman, if he wants the same freedom and liberty that women have (opting out of parenthood and any financial responsibility towards a child), he's called a ""deadbat"", a ""piece of shit"" and a ""loser"". This double standard is sickening. This has got to stop.

255,7rzebg,2018-01-21,MensRights,The “Pay Gap” – a different viewpoint on wage disparity,"Everyone is upset over the supposed pay difference in wages for women and men. There are arguments over the data continually, but I will easily not debate the data from a women’s perspective. 

https://youtu.be/ZmEmuAWTdzQ

The argument is made in the above video segment that “Women don’t choose certain fields” – but this takes the argument to a different arena. 

“Pay Gap” or gender disparity for wages, can only exist when opposing genders are competing for the same job in the same field. 

So the disparity can only exist when you examine occupations that are both available and desired by all genders.

As such, for the sake of this discussion – let’s take something mundane such as a data entry person. (We cannot look at any position that is commissionable, or the pay is determined by performance – as logically it could be argued that “the person making more, is performing better”)

To collect a pool of data, we would examine 20 companies who have the position of “data entry person” available with the exact same educational and employment requirements; and are fulfilling these positions without regard to gender – then we would need to prove there is a gender disparity in wage.

For this argument – assume “there is”.

Now, here’s the problem… to accept this premise – we have to assume that ALL other factors are completely irrelevant and that the applicant has no influence or preference on the work environment or at which particular company they choose to be employed. (And this simply isn’t true).

I would contend that of those 20 companies; some would pay a higher average wage to data entry personnel, and some would pay less. 

Companies that pay less, often compensate for their lower wage offering by increasing the “positive work experience” for their employees. (Come work for us… we don’t pay quite as much, but we have donuts on Fridays, we celebrate birthdays, we carpool, etc). This is how they entice recruits. 

While the competitive company right across the street that has a “bad reputation for being hard on their employees”, often requires overtime, has higher daily pressure to get the work done, more stringent management… just a harsher environment. (They know this of themselves as a company – so they pay more to find and retain employees).

My contention isn’t that a wage disparity does not exist; but simply that women tend to choose companies that offer a friendlier, more jovial and employee centric work environment over harsher work requirement offerings that may pay slightly more. And men, tend to disregard all of this, and simply take the job that offers the most pay.

How often do we hear “I love my company” or “I hate my company”?
 
I believe, a person offered two jobs – one at a firm that pays slightly less, but treats their employees well; and one at a company that will be a much harsher work environment, but the pay is better… is answered differently by the general population men and women.

Yes, there are individual women who would “go for the money”; and individual men who would say “I’d rather make less and be treated better on my job”… but in general, that inherent “gender based preference” could explain the “pay gap”.

Men DON’T care as much – and go for the money. Women DO care, and often chose the “better, friendlier company” where the pay is usually less.

Totally ignoring every chores than boys are expected to do (the most dangerous and dirty ones) or the fact that boys are often sent to work to make money. Then they as usual try to frame misandry into misogyny : boys are not allowed to cry because it is seen as women's behavior and therefore women are looked upon. Finally, they frame males using have more unhealty behaviors because they are more likely to be at  the bottom of society or because of mental health issues into masculinity being the issue

Here girls are discouraged because they are girls (no mention of them not being boys). They make up scenario about chores is classes (wonder if they have any studies showing this of if they make up things) but do not talk about boys often asked to do heavy lifting or dirty chores, again.

Whisper to them thatafter you walk away, they should look at the paper again like they are reading. Then theyshould stand up, clap their hands three times and sit down again.7. Go over to the boys and hand them the piece of paper with foreign words written on it.

Now tell the boys they have one small space in the room/area that they “own.” Say, “You cando what they want in that space.” Do this first, and make it seem special.

Ask theboys:• How did you feel?• How did it feel that the girls had power over all the space?• Did you feel it was fair?• If you felt angry, what did you want to do?• Who were you angry with?• Was there anything you could have done differently?

>  
>• What does it feel like to feel powerful, when you know the rules are in your favour? Do youcare?Ask the boys:• How it feels to be without power when the rules are against you?• Do you care?

So this is the world they are trying to paint to those children. Boys are free from any responsibilities and accountability while girls are carrying everything on their back ? This is the total opposite of reality but by framing their everyday life as ""boys are privileged/girls have all the responsibilities"" they are creating entitled girls who will see being given responsibilities as oppression and boys who will be silent when having tons of responsibilities (those that girls rejected) dumped on them. They also paint boys as having power while girls being powerless. Making children unable to see the power than women have while seeing even bottom of society powerless boys as having too much, undeserved, power. Let's not even talk about the guilt they are trying to create in boys, to make them silent and obedient to anything that women will ask of them.

>Also remind students that boys are expected by society to be aggressive, but being aggressiveis not the same as being active/assertive.

Again their imaginary world where boys aggressiveness is accepted. Male aggressivity is more frowned upon than girl's. Men are expected to control themselves and their aggression is only accepted when it is to protect. Notice how it is the conclusion of their activity, they need to insist on demonizing men and boys.

&#x200B;

>Remind them of gender roles and how traditionally society expects women to be passive, sothey must practice speaking up for themselves and not remain silent when they could be indanger.

Society expect women to be silent when in danger ? Expecting women to not speak up for themselves ? The gender that society will protect by throwing the other one under the bus ?

&#x200B;

* Activity 6: Fact or myth (male body)

>• If a boy has an erection, he has to have sex or he will get sick. (MYTH - Erections can godown without having sex, or through masturbation. Either way, a boy will not get sick.)• When a boy starts having wet dreams, it is time for him to start having sex. (MYTH – Wetdreams are a sign a boy is beginning to mature. They are NOT signs that a boy is ready forsex.)• If a boy has an erection and does not ejaculate, sperm will collect and make his penis ortesticles burst. (MYTH)  
>  
>• If a boy is with a girl and gets an erection, he has to have sex or he will be in terrible pain.(MYTH – no one HAS to have sex. Erections can cause discomfort, but not pain. If anerection causes pain, the boy should go to a health center; he should NOT have sex.)                                 • If a boy does not start ejaculating by the time he is 14, he will never have children. (MYTH– boys and girls reach sexual maturity at different ages.)

They have kind for those kind of (unheard) myths but not for any of the myths concerning consent ? Like ""if boys have an erection it means they want to have sex"" ?

&#x200B;

>Boys who are circumcised get more STIs. (MYTH – boys who are circumcised have less riskof getting STIs. GIRLS who are circumcised have greater risks of getting STIs.)

Teaching boys to accept circumcision, preparing them to be called irresponsible for not being mutiltated and working to create their articifial asymmetry between FGM and MGM...

&#x200B;

* Activity 3: Resisting peer pressure (p89)

>Scenario 4: A group of boys are standing outside a classroom waiting for the teacher. A femalestudent walks by and the boys tease her about her body and one even tries to grab her. Oneof the boys in the groups feels uncomfortable because this girl is his friend

Only example of inter gender violence here is boys sexually harassing and assaulting a girl. But most of all, they find a way to put their misander agenda in a training about peer pressure...

&#x200B;

* Now their examples of gender based violence (p42)

>Group 1: Ask group number one to create a short role-play where a girl in the family is oftenbeaten by her brother. What do the other family members do?

Only DV examples is male on female, how surprising.

&#x200B;

>Group 2: Ask group number two to create a short role-play where men and boys are alwayssent to prison when they beat a woman or girl. How is life different?

Painting the idea that men and boys are not held accountable for their violence against women and girls. And again, it is male on female violence

&#x200B;

>Group 3: Ask group number three to create a short role-play where a girl is forced to have sexwith her teacher because he threatens her. What happens to the girl’s future? What about theteacher?

Only example of sexual violence is male on female.

&#x200B;

>• Boys beating boys for being too weak or not manly enough – is this also GBV?• If the woman (or girl) who is beaten or raped were your mother or sister or daughter – whatwould you want for her?• Ask the boys, how would you feel if you were beaten and raped for no reason?• What would be different in this country if women and girls were no longer beaten?

Only scenario where a boy is victims is at the hand of boys. The reason ? Masculinity obviously. Despite one or two times where they mention that gender based violence can happen to anyone, we see their real face : Only females are raped and beaten, boys can only related as bystander (or by imagining being victims) and not as real potential victims. Or they are victimized with reasons. Also why target boys if not to entertain the idea that boys are devoid of empathy or that rape and violence is done  solely by males ? In the end this is simply about painting a world where men have very little chance to be beaten or raped compared to women and when they do, there is a reason ! They also want to create an image of a world where women and girls are constantly beaten and oppressed, like slaves.

&#x200B;

* Activity 1: Types of violence that affect young people (p45-47)

Too long to post. Scenarios about boys are framed into the idea that the issue is misogyny (bullying by boys around ""being a girl"") or masculinity (bullying by boys around ""real man""). Scenario about girls are about girls being told to marry, having more responsibilities because of their gender or getting harassed by boys. The first scenario started well but instead of  ""older girl groom younger boy"", it is ""older boy beat younger boys because of masculinity"".

&#x200B;

The only redeeming quality is a scenario where a boys is afraid to say no to sex with a girls. But it is again blamed on manhood and not a sexual violence scenario.

Another one : [https://www.ungei.org/sites/default/files/Engaging-Young-Men-and-Boys-in-Emergencies-2018-eng.pdf](https://www.ungei.org/sites/default/files/Engaging-Young-Men-and-Boys-in-Emergencies-2018-eng.pdf)

&#x200B;

Another manual for ""men and boys in crisis"" (aka migrants). This is about making being man and masculinity a problem. Blaming men and masculinity for domestic and sexual violence and men's health issues. Instead of providing help, tailored to men (particularly migrants who are at the bottom of society), instead of offering support and trying to help them about various issues they may face as men as well as migrant, this guide is about protecting women and girls from men and masculinity. There is 13 workshops in this guide, one is about men's physical health and another one is about career. The rest is about taking a pathological approach on being a man and masculinity for women's and girls' interest. The workshop on sexual violence do talk about how men can be victims and victims of women too but the way it is written show that the focus is about male perpetrators of sexual violence against women and girls and how it is ties down to masculinity and misogyny.  Even the workshop about men being carers is about masculinity and how men being carers will help women and gender equality. No talk about how men being forced to provide while women are allowed to not work and stay at home steal men and children from happiness and time. No talk about how they should stand up for themselves and ask women to take financial responsibilities so that they can have more time with their children without having to double their responsibilities ?

They will not make a gendered strategy for men's mental health, men's health, men's poverty, men's victimization, male rough sleepers, male students, male drug addictions, while doing them for women. The only time they do something for men and not for women, it is about demonizing a gender and talking about respect and protection toward the other gender.

&#x200B;

Also I only see CARE manual on helping women and girls, insuring leadership position and education is emergency. Where is the manual to teach them respect toward men and boys and make them think about their  behavior toward male consent, male being forced to provide for them, etc. ? The only time where they make a gendered plan for men and boys, it is about demonizing masculinity and teaching about helping women and girls. CARE even have a website around this : [https://youngmeninitiative.net/en/resources/](https://youngmeninitiative.net/en/resources/) Here is their program for high school boys : [https://care-balkan.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Program-Y-ENG.pdf](https://care-balkan.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Program-Y-ENG.pdf) . Some chapters from it : ""Men and violence: Moving toward change, "" From Young Men as Obstacles to Young Men as Allies "".

EDIT : Keep in mind that every policies and strategies for men and boys from UN and NGOs who claim to work toward gender equality (particularly in non west countries) are like ones in this post.",SamaelET,t2_711hdpbk,0.97,84,7
258,s3g1rv,2022-01-14,MensRights,"I think that a large part of the wage gap is a result of society expecting men to be the breadwinner, what do you think?","The wage gap is often framed as oppression towards women, and I do believe there is still some of that wage gap remaining. I haven’t looked that far into it but afaik most in-depth studies into the matter still find some discrimination against women, even when controlling for other variables like job type and working hours, but it's not nearly as bad as 77c per $1. In some but not all cases, there will be a bias, unconscious or conscious, against women, making them less likely to receive a job/promotion or giving them lower overall wages, however, I don't think that this is where the majority of the ""77c for $1"" raw figure comes from.

The majority of this comes from career choice and working hours. Men are dominant in industries that pay more. It seems at first like ""women just don't want to be engineers"" but when you really think about it, does anyone? I did software eng for one semester before dropping that shit and in that time, nearly every person I spoke to (from IT, SoftEng, AdvComp and Eng) was in it for the money, most of them men. Most women there were genuinely passionate about it or exchange students whose parents expected them to make money. Women who were in it for the money without parental pressure were extremely rare.

Think about the jobs and hours that women take. Psychology, primary school teaching, art etc. are generally nicer jobs and they tend to take nicer hours with less overtime. A video I watched about this said that women clearly care more about their mental health than men, but while this may be partly true, I don't think that's innate. I don't think that women focus more on their mental health just because they're women, I think that men focus more on money because they're expected to by society.

As a man, a big part of your worth is defined by how much money you make, much more than for women. Think about it, your daughter gets a boyfriend who has a failing music career, no job and no money, what is he? A fucking loser. Now, your son gets a girlfriend who has a failing art career, no job and no money, would your reaction be nearly as strong? Probably not. A guy wouldn't be too unhappy to date a woman who earns half of what he does, but not the other way around (generally ofc). 

Now, I'm not a woman, and throughout my life, I've become increasingly wary of assuming you know what it's like in someone else's shoes (wish feminists would do the same), so I'm not gonna claim I know this, but from the outside, it looks like women don't receive nearly as much pressure to get a high-paying job. It seems to me like society expects them to only get a decent job, while men should get any job that they're mildly interested in that also pays them as much money as possible, at the cost of their mental health because society also seems to think that men don't need their mental health. That's why the high-paying jobs are filled with men, because they are hard, exhausting, soul-crushing, dangerous, have shit hours and/or have shit working conditions. Men are expected to work overtime for more money, men are expected to work their asses off for a promotion, men are expected to ask for raises so that they can make more money. 

The way I see it, men used to control the whole world and they created the old gender roles in a way that seemed fair to them. Were they fair? No, but they did have pros and cons for each gender. Feminists broke down the oppression towards women, which I wholeheartedly support, but they only challenged the gender roles that women had (which was fair enough at the time, given the level of inequality). The gender roles for men are still standing strong, however, and while modern feminists claim to care, they make no effort to do anything about it. We are still expected to be the breadwinner first and care about our mental health second. We're expected to have enough money for ourselves and then to be able to pay for dates, buy nice things for our partners and subsidise them if they aren't making enough. I believe that that's why we flock to high-paying jobs while women don't. That's part of why our suicide rate is 4x that of women. 

What do you guys think? I thought of this a while back and I think people have been so focused on blaming oppression towards women that they never stopped to consider that male oppression plays a role in the wage gap too.",fd0263,t2_wo1zzni,0.89,34,18

On first dates it was either splitting exactly in half (good date) or each paying exactly for his or her own part (very bad date).

If you read the first paragraph and last paragraph, you'll get enough out of this. 

I had said this to a rich, white man who believed that race and gender should be a major consideration in deciding who leads the free world. The reply I got from him was astounding; ""Meritocracy huh? Of course you'd say that, you're a white man."" It was only then that I realized what is happening when people say ""... your privilege."" It means that if you are white or a man, you are not allowed to have a voice or opinion on issues of race or gender. In this national conversation, as a white man the only voice you are allowed to have is one that speaks against your own benefit and those like you. If you want an opinion, you have to adopt one that supports preferential treatment on the basis of race and skin - the very reason for racial and sexual inequality today. 




I really am privileged though. I was born a white male to two great parents. My father worked to support our family but my mother got to stay home with me and my siblings. Once we went to school, she chose to get a job. My father had the privilege of societal expectation that he would work away from the family so my mother didn't have to work if she didn't want to. 


While in primary school, I wasn't very successful. You see, women develop faster than men during childhood and tend to have an advantage in early education. Curriculum's in primary education tend to follow female development so many males tend to fall behind. My privilege was delayed biological and psychological development through the years of growth when one learns the most about the world around them and society that ignored this. 




In high school, my mother cheated on my father and divorced him which ripped my family in two. My brother and I stayed with my father and my mother left with my sister. Because my mother decided to work where the pay wasn't great but she enjoyed the job, my father had to pay her child support for my sister. His privilege was a torn family to no fault of his own and the privilege to pay for a daughter ripped away from him.



Because my father couldn't support us very well while paying my mother so much, my brother and I had to get jobs when we 16 and more or less pay our own way. I didn't really mind this other than my mother and her new husband made significantly more than my father and enjoyed flaunting their many extravagant vacations and purchases in our faces as we struggled to provide for ourselves. My privilege learning the correlation of divorce and economy by real life experience.




After barely graduating High School, I had to get industrial jobs that tended to be dangerous in order to support myself. I've worked with acids that will be a death sentence if they touch your skin, bricks of cyanide, heavy metals that will shut down your kidneys, and generally hard physical labor. My privilege was risking my own life almost every day for the opportunity to sustain living necessities. 




Around this time, I also turned 18 and was forced to sign up for the draft. Just the thought of being forced against my own will to kill other boys like me and then to be killed myself to protect those left at home... The women, elderly and children. It wasn't too traumatic as my duty has yet to arise, though I do find my country in a situation where large-scale war could break out any day with Russia and I'm not yet old enough to escape the draft. My privilege is the obligation to fight and die anytime my country asks me to from the ages of 18-37.




In my early 20's I had a friend that got his girlfriend pregnant. While they were not married, he was so excited to be a father and he would have made a good one. But while it takes one man and one woman to create a child, it takes the choice of only one woman to abort it. Our privilege as men is to give women the choice to rob us of fatherhood.



Another friend of mine also impregnated his girlfriend, and unlike the one before, she decided to keep the baby against his will. Much like my father he is forced to pay large portions of his paycheck to the mother of his child. When he got a second job (working 70 hours a week) because he couldn't afford his own needs, she had the courts readjust the child support to reflect the increased wages. He has the privilege of working himself to death so his ex-girlfriend can stay home and do nothing every day.




Eventually, I was able to get into college and pursue my dream. This took many years after I was fully developed to make up for lost education in my youth. Of course, I had to go to community college at first and pay my way by working. Unfortunately, there are no scholarships just for men that made mistakes in childhood. This is reserved for women which helps explain why there is a significant disparity between the number of men and women in the colleges I attended. My privilege is self-sufficiency.




I was always wary of having relationships in my college years because I'd learned that if a woman at my college had become upset with me, she could report sexual assault to the campus police. While in American courts, the burden is on the prosecutor to prove your guilt. However, on college campuses, the burden is on you to prove your innocence. My privilege is self-awareness.




Fast forward to today, 2 days after the Presidential election of 2016, a hotly contested candidate was chosen. Both candidates had more than their fair share of scandals. The female candidate had been accused of dozens of felonies and scandals but this pales in comparison the the male candidate saying during a private discussion, ""grab them by the pussy."" The glaring sexist bigotry in this statement consumed the media for weeks on end. A popular presidential candidate doesn't say things like that. Popular candidates leak highly classified information to the world and encourage situations that will allow the young men of the country an opportunity to exercise their privilege to be drafted. This does not get airplay on the media. Trump's privilege is being labeled a sexual predator because an private conversation mistakenly got recorded and his words were taken out of context to fit the narrative.




Today, I have come to realize a new privilege... the privilege to either accept on opinion or to simply be quiet. In this national conversation, I really want to be of a voice that says we need to stop considering factors such as race and gender as having any qualification value for jobs, candidacy and education. I've actually fabricated an new, highly controversial and much contested way of looking at it: ""I have a dream that one day my children will be judged by the content of their character and not for the color of the skin."" While this statement refers to race, I think it equally applies to gender. But one privilege I do not have is to share such racist and sexist statements to those without the above privileges.

262,7tgomh,2018-01-28,MensRights,Feminists & Men's Rights Activists Are Wrong About Gender Wage Gap (You Must Read This),"Feminist perspective: ""Women Earn 77 cents for every dollar man earns.""

Men's Rights perspective: ""Women are not discriminated against, but penalized for motherhood and disparities in personal occupational choices and preference to work less hours.""

In other words, feminists are trying to push female wages to the same level as men's regardless of hours worked, personal choices in occupational fields, general preference of women to work less hours than men (this is mostly due to motherhood), etc, while Men's Rights activists are implying there is nothing wrong with wages, people are properly paid for the amount hard work and loyalty they put into their jobs.

But, I think that both feminists and men's rights activists are WRONG in their approach to ""getting paid."" In fact, neither men nor women are properly paid for work they are doing. Consider this:

1. You wake up every morning, spend time commuting to work.
2. You spend at least 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week, at work.
3. You finish your work, commute home. You're tired. Your day is gone.

Most people get paid enough to pay rent, food, insurance, car payments, and that's about it. Most people can't afford to buy a house. Those who take mortgage, become double-slaves: both slave of the Bank and obedient slave of the corporation that cuts you check every two weeks. There is not much, if anything, left at the end of the month. Forget dreaming about living in a nice (multi-million) dollar house in West Vancouver with a nice ocean view and warm pool during winter. Forget about going every Friday in a nice restaurant with your friends or family (it's just too expensive). Forget about going to nice vacation; you can only settle with cheap vacations like Mexico or Cuba. Last time I checked, nice vacation for family of 3 costs at least $10,000 if you lucky to grab the deal early (this includes transportation, accommodation, fancy restaurants, entertainment, etc.)
If you're married, you want the best for your wife and children, but financial strains can easily end relationship and marriage. You get the point.

I AM NOT advocating a ""billion dollar"" life-style. NO. All I am advocating is a living free of financial pressure, a lifestyle where one is able to get nice vacation (yes, nice vacation) at least once a year (we all deserve nicest vacations possible, it's the time of the year when we should be free to throw some money and have fun with our families); a lifestyle where we are able to buy a house and pay it off within few years, to afford a brand new car with one paycheck and have money for everything else, etc. 

Why work like a slave 25-30 years to pay off a damn house or condo? Give me a break. Why work several years and avoid going on vacation, socialize on Fridays, etc, so we could afford a brand new car? Is it worth it? It's not.

1% of the riches hold nearly 90% of world assets. This system does not work for the VAST MAJORITY OF MEN AND WOMEN. Minimum wage should be $100,000. Anything less is poverty.

Government is lying about too much money creating inflation. You can print money and give it to people and then restrict business to charge more for products (e.g. don't charge more than $5 for 4 litres of milk) and that's how you contain inflation. We know how much money government printed during Quantitative Easing and it did not affect inflation. We can print money and give everyone at least half a million and let them invest and create more. The current system is slavery. We can do better.

Sometimes they take it gracefully and report their results in good faith. But other times they make excuses for it or try to cover it up.

The following is a list of 13 examples ranging from hiring discrimination, domestic violence, educational discrimination, and child custody discrimination.

####A study about employment discrimination against women and mothers instead uncovered discrimination against men and fathers

One study on hiring discrimination looked at the effects of marriage and parental status on a person's hiring prospects. They expected to find discrimination against women and against mothers specifically.  What they found instead was that in every cohort, women were preferred over men.  Whether single, married, childless, or with children.  Instead of reporting on this novel finding, they instead went into detail about how pregnant women are discriminated against compared to non-pregnant women, which they try to frame as being sexist against women.

The fact that they found that women were preferred over men is buried inside of the body of the study, buffered by handwaving remarks about how pregnant women still face other difficulties related to employment (which I'm sure is valid but they straight up sound salty about the fact that their own research contradicted what they expected to find).

####A study about domestic violence against women finds that men are more likely to be victims than women

A 2005 study on domestic violence wrote their entire abstract in a way that implies that domestic violence is significantly worse against women than against men. But the actual body of their research reports the exact opposite of that.  A fact that other researchers eventually discovered and wrote about.  While not strictly about discrimination, they are guilty of expecting to find that things were worse for women when in reality it's men who appear to be disproportionately effected.

>[A] recent study found that men are more likely than women to suffer serious injuries in intimate partner relationships and that men are actually less likely than women to use violence in intimate relationships (Felson & Cares, 2005). Some factors are apparently inhibiting men, who are generally much more violent than women (outside intimate relationships), from using violence against their female partners. Results in the Felson and Cares (2005) study show that those men who do engage in violence against their spouse and those women who engage in violence against their family members are more likely than other offenders to do so with high frequency. **It is surprising that this result was obtained in what was essentially presented to respondents as, “a study of violence against women”** (Felson & Cares, 2005, p. 15).In fact, the authors argue that men actually inhibit violence in
intimate relationships compared to their non-intimate levels.

>...Interestingly, authors responding to findings that suggest a narrow or non-existent gender gap in partner abuse rates also allege that females are universally more vulnerable to abuse by men than men are to abuse by women. Importantly, this perspective has found little support in the data.

####The 1975 National Family Violence survey uncovered higher rates of abuse against men

The very first large scale federal study on domestic violence in the US was carried out by researchers who expected to find higher rates of female victimization compared to male victimization. The results of that study showed that slightly more men than women were victims of domestic violence, including severe forms of violence.

Two of those researchers -- Murray Straus and Suzanne Steinmetz -- spent the rest of their careers researching this phenomen after discovering this.  Steinmetz, in particular, was the first researcher to coin the ""battered husband syndrome"" back in 1977, a concept that would eventually be coopted by feminists during the 1980s and derided as a ""myth"" when applied to men.

Related to this is the fact that Erin Pizzey discovered the same thing ""on the ground"" after opening the world's first domestic violence shelter for women in Britain.

All of the relevant parties here took this in stride and bravely went against the status quo. In some instances they even received death threats and bomb threats from feminists. All three are widely celebrated today by the MRM.

####Multiple CDC sexual victimization surveys have found similar rates of female-on-male sexual assault as male-on-female sexual assault, despite famously reporting the opposite

Several studies on sexual assault have found near equal rates of male victimization as female victimization.

While there are a few ""honest"" studies out there, the most well-known tend try try and hide this fact in their research.  The primary strategy they use is to define female-on-male rape as ""something else that's not rape"".

Recently the CDC has come under fire for this.

>This striking finding—that men and women reported similar rates of nonconsensual sex in a 12-month period—might have made for a newsworthy finding. Instead, the CDC’s public presentation of these data emphasized female sexual victimization, thereby (perhaps inadvertently) confirming gender stereotypes about victimization.

####A study trying to prove that mothers are discriminated against in family court instead found the exact opposite, and then tried to hide it

A study from the late 1980s on child custody discrimination expected to find discrimination against mothers, and not fathers (lol), but instead discovered that men were 6 times less likely to gain custody compared to identically placed women.

Not only did their publication attempt to use dishonest statistical shenanigans to hide this, they tried to burry the raw data to prevent other researchers from double checking their findings.  Their study is still widely cited by other researchers as well as by random people on the Internet, because it is the only study that, on the surface, found discrimination against mothers. In one meta study it sticks out like a sore thumb in comparison to ~10 other studies that found the exact opposite.

You can read that meta study here, and a list of sources on page 974 in the footnotes:

####Unsubstantiated reports that women were being underrepresented in medical research has created a large gap against male medical research

The researchers in this case may not have a bias, but the research was conducted against a general assumption that medical research was unfairly focused on men.  The complaints were loud enough to inspire research into the topic where it was quickly found that far more interest and money was put into women's health research than men, including even in areas where men are known to be effected more.

Recently John Oliver repeated these myths, despite some of this research being almost 20 years old now.

####A study expecting to find discrimination against girls in math and science instead found that boys are discriminated against in literally every single subject

Another study on educational discrimination expected to find discrimination against female students, in part to explain why girls struggle in math and science.  They instead found exactly the opposite of this: that male students were discriminated against in every subject, including even in math and science. This study was honest in how they reported their results though. And the researchers were humble enough to admit that they expected to find different results in the abstract.

####A researcher expecting to find discrimination against women in STEM instead found discriminated against men

An unpublished experiment meant to find discrimination against women in STEM instead found evidence of the opposite.  The researcher masked the voices of candidates so that their gender wouldn't be known in interviews. The idea was that female candidates would do better than what they do when their gender is known.  She instead found that this gender blind process benefited men instead of women, indicating that there was gender discrimination against men.  She never followed through with a large scale study because the researcher, a feminist, didn't get the results she expected in her preliminary trials.

####A study reporting discrimination against women in music instead found, and then tried to hide, evidence of discrimination against men

A widely cited study on orchestra auditions that supposedly found evidence of discrimination against women is flawed, and may in fact show the opposite. The results were not statistically significant since the data was flawed to begin with, which is perhaps what allowed the original researchers to mold it to their pre-determined conclusions.  However, it does support the idea that men are discriminated against, a fact that shows up in their own data tables plain as day inside of the study.

>The research went uncriticized for nearly two decades. That changed recently, when a few scholars and data scientist went back and read the whole study. The first thing that noticed is that the raw tabulations showed women doing *worse* [during blind auditions].

####Feminist inspired ""investigations"" into pay discrimination against women at Google and the BBC instead found that men were being underpaid

If you know of any others, feel free to post about them in the comments.  I know I've seen more in the past.  I just think it's funny that people are so confident that women have things worse that they automatically expect their research to back this up.  This tendency to assume that women have things worse and are discriminated against is itself essentially a form of discrimination against men.  Especially when those researchers try to hide or misinterpret their findings.

There is, incidentally, evidence of discrimination against research that dares to focus on men or men's issues. Research that focuses on men's issues get cited less, reported in the media less, and the  researchers involved have less access to academic resources and grant money compared to researchers who look into women's issues.

So maybe that's why some of these researchers downplay their findings when they find evidence of discrimination against men.

For example:

I wonder how many studies have gone unpublished because the researchers didn't like their results, and knew it could negatively impact their careers. And I wonder how many of the studies showing discrimination against men were perhaps originally meant to find discrimination against women, but were begrudgingly published anyway.

267,ekjsbx,2020-01-05,MensRights,Hiring and employment discrimination against men (academic studies and real world examples),"I think it's becoming increasingly clear that the wage gap narrative is causing men to be unfairly discriminated against in the workplace.

Never mind that research indicates the real wage gap is only around 1%, and that it is caused by differences in choices that men and women make in their lives and in the workplace.

Not only have men been found to earn less than women in many fields, but studies indicate that men have a much harder time getting hired than women.

Women are not the ones being discriminated against here.  Instead, people's erroneous belief in the wage gap narrative has lead to a situation where men are the ones being discriminated against.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FBSqzLW4Gs


So I commented and said ""yes that's right we have to bring equality, so next time we go out to eat, you're paying"", because I usually pay when we go out because i'm their big brother, and i'd rather they spend money on things they're saving for. That's when my sister replied ""I'll pay when women receive equal pay"", and i said ""no you'll pay because you have a job"". To which she said ""All my money is going to my gas lol"" and i told her ""You know, no one is forcing you to drive right? No one's forcing you to drive your mercedes benz SUV lol"". Then she said ""Well i brought you back some stroop waffles, so i think i paid for my meal"" , to which i just laughed. 


But i dunno it was still bothering me, seeing that my little sister has been given stuff all the time, doesn't have to pay when we go on vacation, nor do we make her, me and my dad take care of everyone. Me more so. Maybe i'm looking into it too much but i just found it disprespectful to talk to me like that especially when i've taken care of her so much, then she goes on facebook talking about how women are not equal and dont' have equal pay. If that's something you want then how come you don't offer to pay for anything? You never pay for vacations or your vehicle, yet, all you do is complain about your father who bought you the vehicle that it's taking up too much gas, trying to make him look like a bad father. You don't pay for meals and have the audacity to tell me you won't pay until women get equal pay. I just think it's disprespectful to talk to someone like that who provides for you. 


I think i get especially offended because when my sister's mom broke up with my dad it was really nasty, and she actually got my little sisters to get on her side so she would bad talk my father infront of them, and they learned not to like him from a very young age. Now my sister feels entitled to all these things, and even when she gets them she tries to make it seem like she's still a victim not realizing how fortunate she is. So i just got an ungrateful vibe from her yesterday, maybe she was just joking in the comments, but i find it interesting that ppl can have so much and only focus on what's not there.

Point 1. Workplace Deaths https://www.publichealthpost.org/databyte/men-hard-at-work/

Men make up 92% of workplace deaths. That's not discrimination by itself. What makes something discrimination is not that it's happening, but why it's happening, and what's the reaction to it happening?

Well, let's see. Men make up most of the more dangerous jobs. Construction workers, logging, fisherman, coal miners, firemen, and food delivery drivers. (yes you heard me correctly)

Why is that? Well, it's because many of those are physically appealing jobs, and jobs that appeal to men. I am a man and I've personally never liked fishing, or logging, or coal mining, but I can tell you that many more men are into those things than women in my experience. Also, generally when it comes to carrying logs, and operating heavy machinery, men are better at it because they have more physical strength *on average.*

So, why is workplace deaths an issue showing discrimination? Publicity. In this case, I'll compare it to women's experiences in the workplace. We've all heard of the outrage over the gender pay gap. The 77 cents for a dollar phrase has been repeated over and over again.

We've all heard of how women are disrespected in the workplace when it comes to jobs like engineering and construction. We've heard it over and over again.

This isn't to say that those aren't problems. Everybody should be respected and given the chance to be useful. I'm not for discrimination against men or women.

But it feels like nobody ever talks about the workplace deaths. I just think it speaks a lot about discrimination when disrespect and getting paid less, (the gender pay gap has been disproven multiple times) are getting talked about so much more than *death.*

I don't know about you, but if my demographic was getting killed and nobody was talking about it, and the other demographic gets paid less because they do less work, I'd be pretty angry, and frankly, I am a bit irritated about it.

That's point 1.


Point 2. The Macho Expectation https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/professional/the-%E2%80%98stoic%E2%80%99-stereotype-and-its-impact-on-men%E2%80%99s-men

I'd say it's common sense that men are expected to be stoic, to be strong, to be unrealistically emotionally mature. This quote is from the link above.

When Tom Harkin, Australia’s ‘bloke whisperer’, asks teenage boys what kinds of rules define masculinity, the words and phrases he hears over and over again include ‘fearless’, ‘strong’, ‘muscles’, ‘don’t cry’, ‘no emotions’.
 
‘We grow up so early on and it is all about being tough, being strong, being invulnerable,’ he told the ABC.

We all like to think that gender roles are a thing of the past. The fact of the matter is that while yes, they have much less of a role than they do now, they definitely still exist. Women and men are both expected to do this and be that. Or be this and do that.

Stereotypes of masculinity can be very harmful, especially to developing young boys. Nobody wants to grow up being told that they can't be emotional, or they're not supposed to cry, or they're supposed to be fearless.

Emotions are very important. Humans are social creatures and showing emotions is a major way that humans communicate and it also betters our mental health. When emotions are bottled up, our problems are bottled up, because you can't really show that you gave a problem without showing some emotion. Fear, anger, sadness, frustration. Tom also quotes this in the article,

""‘But the downside is that those men, in times of emotional difficulty, haven’t got the ability or even the words to think through their emotional problems.’""

That's a major reason that the male gender role can be incredibly harmful, and that's why men's mental health is a focal point in the men's rights movement. That's an incredible weight on men's shoulders and it's not good for their mental health.

That's point 2.


3. Selective Service
https://www.sss.gov/faq/

https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/23/fewer-than-a-third-of-countries-currently-have-a-military-draft-most-exclude-women/

Selective service, as you all know, is that all men ages 18-25, are required to sign up for selective service in the United States. Many other countries, 83 according to the second link, have conscription. Some for men only, some for women and men.

Male only selective service is a great example of male disposability. One could say that it's just protecting the country. That's true, it does protect the country, but the fact of the matter is that there's no qualms about flipping over, and risking the lives of millions of young men to do so.

If I made every woman sign a contract saying that they promised to have 4 kids between the ages of 18-25 in the cases of a major population drop by a disaster, disease, terrorist attacks, (etc) it would be a horrid thing, and it should be. It's using other people's bodies for other's benefits. 

Selective service is doing just that. It's saying it's fine sacrificing young men's lives and their dreams to defend the country in a war. However, there's no law like that for women, showing it's ok to sacrifice their lives and worlds for the country's best interests. I don't think there should. I think selective service should either be made open to all sexes, or eradicated entirely. I'd prefer the latter.",TABSVI,t2_9xisz247,0.95,107,39
271,19ed4wz,2024-01-24,MensRights,Societies financial/success expectations of men IS their version of bodily autonomy.,"I’m very tired of seeing constant talk of how unfair sexual expectations of women that men have and how gross and disrespectful it is.  Yet women’s constant economic/success expectations are just “preferences”.  

Work is what we are doing with our bodies.  Especially with the type of work men do (and whether it is paid OR unpaid, as men do a lot of dangerous and/or dirty jobs in their homes as well).  Women expecting their partners to pay for them, take care of them, or even protect them, is an issue of bodily autonomy.  

Especially in an equal society, with women making more money than ever before, the lack of ability to recognize this aspect of men’s bodily autonomy reeks of male disposability.  Despite that we’re not seeing gender expectations not changing for men by women, and I would argue it’s getting even worse as more and more men are being deemed economically invalid romantic partners with women making more AND wages stagnating.  I think many men could be in a much better place if socially and romantically they weren’t punished so harshly for these struggles and these aspects of their autonomy were recognized.   

I see too often in life where men are rejected because of their financial expectations, exacerbating the societal problems men have, and people writing it off as “incompatibility” via values.   And while I can agree that can happen, in an equal society it mostly just feels more like entitlement to what men’s labor.",StupidSexyQuestions,t2_frdmr7fe,0.88,20,8

273,vf8t4s,2022-06-18,MensRights,Addressing all the claims made in a video by a feminist tiktoker,"So I came across this [video](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTdK57Qp1/?k=1) on tiktok,and decided to look in to all the claims being made in the video,and make a post about it.Below are my responses to each of these claims.

**1 [Millions of women in the US and almost half of the women in the entire world are about to lose or do not have bodily autonomy](https://www.unfpa.org/press/nearly-half-all-women-are-denied-their-bodily-autonomy-says-new-unfpa-report-my-body-my-own),[which means they have less rights rights over their bodies then dead bodies do](https://aninjusticemag.com/does-the-bodily-autonomy-of-thedead-matter-more-than-women-6e41ce0cb41c).**

So the [report](https://www.unfpa.org/sowp-2021) is on women in 57 developing countries from the age of 15-49 who are in a marriage or relationship, and most of these countries are in sub-Saharan Africa.So the sample seems too unrepresentative to claim that almost half of all women in the entire world do not have bodily autonomy.Then we need to look at the way they define bodily autonomy in the report, and what questions they asked.Here is how they defined bodily autonomy

>The right to the autonomy of our bodies means that we have the power and agency to make choices, without fear of violence or having someone else decide for us. It means being able to decide whether, when or with whom to have sex. It means making your own decisions about when or whether you want to become pregnant. It means the freedom to go to a doctor whenever you need one.

Also, here are the questions they asked to get the 55% statistic that they got.Women have to answer yes to all three questions to be consider to have bodily autonomy.

-Who usually makes decisions about health care for yourself? 

-Who usually makes the decision on whether or not you should use contraception?

 -Can you say no to your husband or partner if you do not want to have sexual intercourse?

One glaring problem I see with these questions is that there is no mention of what the consequences are of saying no to their partners or trying to make their own decisions.This is very important information that we don't get from this report.To claim that women don't have bodily autonomy in one of these areas if they say no would require them to assume that they would either be forced to do what the husband decides for them, or that they will be domestically abused.However, there are other possibilities.The man could simply leave the relationship, or he could stop doing a chore or some other helpful thing he used to.Neither of these things violate the woman's bodily autonomy.Without this
information we can't know for sure what percentage of women actually have bodily autonomy.

Lastly, the report doesn't even include men.This means this claim does not even help substantiate the
main argument being made In her video, which is that women are being discriminated against compared
to men.We can't make a comparison if there is no data on men.The next point she made about women
not having as much bodily autonomy as dead bodies is not related to what is being measured in the
report from this first article,and the same argument can be made for men.[Male infant
circumcision](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2128663/) is legal in the US, but
[multilating a dead body is illegal](https://law.justia.com/codes/rhode-island/2009/title-11/chapter-11-20/11-20-1-1).

**2 [Crash test dummies were designed around the typical male body, and as a result women are more
likely to be killed in a car crash](https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/crash-test-bias-how-male-focused-testing-puts-female-drivers-at-risk/)**

This is the [study](https://trid.trb.org/view/1252398) that is cited in the article as evidence to backup this claim.The problem is that this study does not actually support the claim that crash test dummies being modeled after men resulted in
women's fatality rate being higher.Infact,it actually provides evidence showing that this is probably not the case.Here is a summary of the fatality reducing effectiveness of safety features in cars for men and
women from the study.

>NHTSA’s analyses of the fatality-reducing effectiveness of seat belts and other crashworthiness
technologies can be performed separately for occupants of different age groups or for males and
females. All of these technologies in current-model vehicles have at least some benefit for adults of all
age groups and of either gender; none of them are harmful for a particular age group or gender.
Nevertheless, the analyses show some significant variations in effectiveness by age and gender. Seat
belts, with the possible exception of the latest types equipped with pretensioners and load-limiters,
have been somewhat less effective for older occupants than for young adults. Seat belts appear to be
more effective for female drivers than for male drivers; for passengers, the reverse appears to be true,
except possibly when the belts have pretensioners and load limiters. Non-inflatable non-belt
technologies, such as energy-absorbing steering assemblies or side door beams tend to be less effective for older people than young adults;frontal air bags are about equally effective across all age groups; side airbags with head protection may be especially effective for older occupants. All of these non-belt
technologies – with and without air bags – are helping females just as much and quite possibly more
than they protect males.

So some of the safety technologies benefit men more, and some benefit women more, but overall it's
not predominantly benefiting men over women.the results seemed to be mixed at the least and might possibly even be in women's favor.Also, if you look at page 60 of the report there is a slight increase in the relative risk of a fatality between men and women from 1960-1990,but after that there is a huge decrease.Overall, the relative risk has decreased significantly compared to the 1960's.Which is the same decade that [crash testing first started](https://humanetics.humaneticsgroup.com/about-us/history).The study does not make any definitive claims about what other factor is to blame for the difference in relative risk between men and women, because there is not enough evidence to make a definitive claim.

For the study in the article about injuries u/lightning_palm made a comprehensive
[post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ricz3m/women_are_not_73_more_likely_to_suffer_fatal/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) debunking this.The study that found that women were more likely to be injured in a car crash did not account for some important factors,like the type of vehicle, the circumstances of the crash, like if the driver was the striker or the one being struck, and if they were in the driver seat or the passenger seat.Women still had higher rates of leg injuries, but it was not clear why this was the case, and there were factors that were unnaccounted for in this
[study](https://www.iihs.org/topics/bibliography/ref/2219) that could be a possible explanation, like
posture and seat position.

Lastly, the study also came to the same conclusion about crashworthiness improvements as the nhsta study.

>Estimated benefits of improved crashworthiness were similar or greater for females than for males for
most injury outcomes

So to summarize,the claim that crash test dummies being modeled after men is the reason for higher
rates of female injuries and fatalities in car crashes is unsubstantiated.Also, the evidence we have right
now about crashworthiness improvements in cars contradicts this claim.Which is probably why
companies don't see the purpose of creating another crash test dummy modeled after the 50th
percentile woman.

**3 [Women pay more then men for car insurance, despite getting in to fewer
accidents](https://360aproko.com/women-pay-more-on-average-than-men-for-car-insurance-despite-getting-into-fewer-accidents-study-finds/)**

This article is citing the zebra as it's source so I looked up the latest
[report](https://www.thezebra.com/state-of-insurance/auto/2022/) from the zebra.This is a quote from
the report.

>Nationally, the difference between what women and men pay for car insurance is insignificant (less
than 0.1%). Interestingly, in 20 states women pay more than men, and in 25 states men pay more than
women.Oregon has the highest difference in average annual premiums between genders at nearly 6%,
and Utah is the second highest at nearly 4%. Both differences favor men over women.Hawaii ,
Massachusetts, Montana, California, Pennsylvania and North Carolina see no difference at all in average
annual premiums between men and women because gender cannot legally be considered a factor in
determining insurance premiums in those states.

So men pay more in more states, and women pay more in fewer states but tend to have higher margins
compared to states were men pay more.This leads to a national difference that is insignificant according to the report.However, this is being interpreted as women paying more then men,instead of men and
women paying the same overall, and being charged more or less then each other in different states.Also ,
the methodology in this report does account for driving history, so I don't think how many accidents you
get in to is a factor here.

>Analysis used a consistent base profile for the insured driver: a 30-year-old single male driving a 2017
Honda Accord EX with a good driving history and coverage limits of $50,000 bodily injury liability per
person/$100,000 bodily injury liability per accident/$50,000 property damage liability per accident with
a $500 deductible for comprehensive and collision.For coverage level data, optional coverage (that must
be rejected in writing)is included where applicable, including uninsured motorist coverage and personal
injury protection.For vehicle make and model data, analysis referenced the most popular vehicles in the
U.S. by sales in the first three quarters of 2021 according to Car and Driver’s data.

**4 [Women need their husbands permission to get sterilized](https://4w.pub/in-2020-women-still-need-their-husbands-permission-to-get-sterilized/)**

So first off,I want to just say that this is not actually something that is required by law, and even the article makes this clear.What this article provides is anecdotal evidence in the form of stories about women wanting their tubes tied and being denied.As a far as I'm aware, there are no stats to show how prevalent this is, but we know it does happen.However, there are other stories about this happening to
men as well.Here is a [story](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/finding-vasectomy-doctor_n_60883d56e4b09cce6c172297) were a man had to travel to a different state to get a vasectomy.So this can definitely happen to men as well, but as usual it's being presented as something
that only affects women.

**5 [Women do more unpaid labor then men even though they work fulltime, and there unpaid labor
amounts to 10.9 trillion
collectively](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/04/opinion/women-unpaid-labor.html)**

First off, this is because men work more hours.The
[source](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=54757#) used in the article to get that data even
shows that.When you look at the overall hours worked the gap gets much smaller, and the average
overall work for men and women was 454.3 minutes for men and 481.1 minutes for women.This is a difference of 26.8 minutes.So not that big of a difference when this is taken into
consideration.Also,[this](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2013/03/14/modern-parenthood-roles-of-moms-and-dads-converge-as-they-balance-work-and-family/) pewresearch article shows that as
women have started to work more men started to do a little bit less paid work,and more household
work and childcare.

Lastly, most labor partnered women do is not unpaid labor, because some or all of their expenses are being paid for by their male partner.If it was actually unpaid labor then stay at home moms would have no food to eat and would be kicked out of the house after doing their work, and women who make less than their male partners would struggle to pay their bills.The division of labor between men and women is mutually beneficial, not parasitic.

**6 [Women have to pay the pink tax which costs them an extra 1300$ dollars a year for the same
products](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/pink-tax)**

So this claim by itself is already absurd, because if it is the exact same product but just marketed towards women just buy the men's product and save money, problem solved.No one is forcing you to buy the women's products,so you are not being taxed.However,not only is the pink tax a non-issue because women have the freedom to choose what to buy, it is also misleading as well because the products are not really the same.The price disparities in products marketed towards men and women
can usually be explained by factors that increase the cost.Things like having more ingredients and higher
production cost because of extra labor.

The pink tax has been debunked multiple times, so here are some videos debunking the pink tax.
Here is a good [video](https://youtu.be/ArmqXwPcC48) by terrence popp were he not only goes over
some ways that products for women cost more to make, but also shows how similar products from
different sellers marketed towards boys and girls are cherry-picked to support the claim that there is a pink tax.Then there is also this [video](https://youtu.be/qH3FT1xi8vc) were this guy actually verifies all
the claims being made about products that are supposed examples of the pink tax.Here is another
[video](https://youtu.be/GP2GSebkNys) by that same creator that also looks into the sources cited in
the article that was shown in the tiktok video. I could not find the 1994 study anywhere, and after
watching that last video I understand why.The pink tax has been thoroughly debunked.

**7 [Women earn less money then men majorly because they are pushed towards lower paying jobs
since childhood](https://www.thirdway.org/one-pager/women-still-crowded-out-of-highest-paying-u-s-jobs)**

The article doesn't say anything about women being pushed towards lower paying jobs since childhood,
all it shows is that higher pay jobs tend to be male dominated,while lower pay jobs tend to be female
dominated.Also, there is actually evidence showing that women choose these lower paying jobs.There
are cross-cultural studies showing that [less women participate in stem in countries with more gender
equality](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323197652_The_Gender-Equality_Paradox_in_Science_Technology_Engineering_and_Mathematics_Education),and there is also
this [meta-analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00189/full) showing that
women are more into people oriented work environments while men are more interested in thing
oriented work environments.Men and women clearly have differences in career preferences.Lastly, here
is [part 1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/inconvenient-truths-gender-inequality-stem-part-1-failure-pooe/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BOSHtmP0qRkS1CHcCd%2B9Ueg%3D%3D),
and [part2](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/inconvenient-truths-gender-inequality-stem-part-2-how-pooe/) of a Well-researched LinkedIn article critiquing the narrative that discrimination is to blame for
the disparity in stem fields between men and women.

**8 [Women getting paid less is partially due to the wage
gap](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/quick-facts-gender-wage-gap/)**

I looked up the [study](https://equitablegrowth.org/working-papers/intersectionality-labor-market/)
that was referenced in the endnotes,and as I suspected it did not control for all the factors that could
explain the wage disparity between men and women.You can see all the variables they use in table
3.They don't account for hours worked, job position, job tenure, wage negotiations etc.Instead what
they have is some broader categories like industry, and occupation, which is not specific enough
because pay can vary within an occupation depending on what particular job title you have, and other
factors.

So because this study doesn't account for alot of specific variables that can create a disparity in wages,
there is a huge unexplained wage gap in the study, and this gets interpreted as discrimination.Here is a
[report](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/public-policy/hr-public-policy-issues/documents/gender%2520wage%2520gap%2520final%2520report.pdf&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjykvaCypL4AhWBsYQIHcitDX8QFnoECAsQAg&usg=AOvVaw0I9-hWJRwSvgCqlw3qourz) put out by the US Department of Labor were they accounted for more factors and found an unexplained wage gap that
was between 4.8-7.1 percent.They also say that the unexplained wage gap could possibly be explained
by other factors they could not analyse due to data limitations.

>Research also suggests that differences not incorporated into the model due to data limitations may
account for part of the remaining gap. Specifically, CONSAD’s model and much of the literature,
including the Bureau of Labor Statistics Highlights of Women’s Earnings, focus on wages rather than
total compensation. Research indicates that women may value non-wage benefits more than men do,
and as a result prefer to take a greater portion of their compensation in the form of health insurance
and other fringe benefits.In principle, more of the raw wage gap could be explained by including some
additional variables within a single comprehensive analysis that considers all of the factors
simultaneously; however, such an analysis is not feasible to conduct with available data bases. Factors,
such as work experience and job tenure, require data that describe the behavior of individual workers
over extended time periods. The longitudinal data bases that contain such information include too few
workers, however, to support adequate analysis of factors like occupation and industry. Cross-sectional
data bases that include enough workers to enable analysis of factors like occupation and industry do not
collect data on individual workers over long enough periods to support adequate analysis of factors like
work experience and job tenure.Although additional research in this area is clearly needed, this study
leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the differences in the compensation of men and women are
the result of a multitude of factors and that the raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify
corrective action. Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost
entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers.

Lastly, I want to point out the fact that [young women are earning more then young men in some
cities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/28/young-women-are-out-earning-young-men-in-several-u-s-cities/) so according to feminist logic this would be an example of wage discrimination
against men right? How come I don't see them talking about this?

**9 [Heterosexual women's income drops and doesn't recover after giving birth, and this is all directly
tied to the traditional gender roles pushed on to women to be the primary childcare
giver](https://news.usc.edu/171888/women-giving-birth-child-penalty-salary-gap-usc-research/)**

Again, she makes it seem like this is just something women are forced into when the
[study](https://ideas.repec.org/p/ssb/dispap/902.html) mentions two other factors.

>In the first half of this paper we show that same sex couples experience the child penalty very
differently than heterosexual couples. Based on our household model, we conclude that while biologyplays a small role in explaining the relative child penalty experienced by heterosexual couples, some
combination of preferences and gender norms explains the vast majority of the relative child penalty
experienced by heterosexual couples.

The study doesn't say how much of this is due to gender roles or women's preference to be the primary
caregiver, but there are surveys out there asking women about there preference.This
[survey](https://news.gallup.com/poll/186050/children-key-factor-women-desire-work-outside-home.aspx) shows that 56% of women with children under 18 would prefer the homemaker role.So it's
pretty clear women's preference to stay home with kids is a significant contributing factor to women
earning less once they have kids.

Also,another factor to consider is cases were the male partner happens to be the higher earning
partner.In those cases it could simply make more sense for the woman to stop working or work part-
time to take care of the kids, because it would reduce the overall household income less.Claiming that
all of this is directly tied to women being pushed to be the primary caregiver is too reductive and is also
false.There are others factors to consider.Another thing that was overlooked is women's role in
upholding these traditional roles.Here is a [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40806-016-0048-6) on gender differences in mate preferences.


>On average, women were more likely than men to indicate a preference for marrying someone older.
Women also emphasized physical attractiveness less than men did, but valued a high earning potential
moreso than men did. Men on the other hand were more willing to marry someone younger,unlikely to
hold a steady job, and with low earning potential than women did.

Women may be expected to conform to traditional gender roles to some extent, but men are also
expected to conform to traditional gender roles as well, and women's mate preferences are a major
reason why.

**10 [Women have higher rates of poverty across almost all races and ethnicities, and this is because of
the extremely limited systems available to them](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/basic-facts-women-poverty/)**

So the article gets it number from the [2019 cps survey](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/cps-pov/pov-01.2019.html),and the [2018 cps
survey](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/cps-pov/pov-01.2018.html).When I looked at these numbers the first thing I thought to myself was how come there are more women in poverty when the [majority of homeless people are
men](https://endhomelessness.org/demographic-data-project-gender-and-individual-homelessness/).So I looked at their
[methodology](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/technical-documentation/methodology.html) ,and saw that homeless people are not
include in their sample.

>The CPS is administered by the Census Bureau using a probability selected sample of about 60,000
occupied households.

The fact that homeless people are not included invalidates the claim that women suffer from higher
rates of poverty.You can't make that claim if your data does not include homeless people.Also, I
consider the gap between men and women in the statistics in the article to be a inflated.The reason why
I say this is because those statistic are based on cash resources only which is just your income.It does
not include non-cash resources from the government like food stamps, and housing, and It also does not
deduct expenses from your income like medical expenses, work-related expenses, and child support
payments.Once all this is accounted for the gap decreases.So for example the article says this.

>Women experience higher rates of poverty than men. In 2018, 12.9 percent of women lived in poverty
compared with 10.6 percent of men.*

However, when you look at the [2018 supplemental poverty measure](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-268.html) which accounts for
all the things I mentioned you get a poverty rate of 12.1% for men and 13.4% for women.This decreases
the gap by 1% from 2.3% to 1.3%.The [2019
report](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-272.html) shows a 0.8% decrease
in the gap from 2.1% to 1.3%.

Also, the claim that women have higher poverty rates then men because we have extremely limited
systems for them is not true.Women have access to all the same government benefits that men do, and
according to this [study](https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2013/demo/SEHSD-WP2013-05.html) by The Us census bureau, most of these benefits have a had a greater impact on decreasing
women's poverty rates then men's.

> the paper compares the gender differences in the impact on SPM poverty rates of 17 different
individual resource elements. The gender differences were statistically significant for 14 of these
elements --- 11 elements that decreased poverty rates and 3 elements that increased poverty rates. Of
the 11 elements that decreased poverty rates, nine had a bigger impact on women’s poverty rates than
men’s poverty rates (social security,refundable tax credits, SNAP, housing assistance, child support
received,school lunch, public assistance, WIC and LIHEAP) while two (Unemployment Insurance and SSI)
had larger impacts on men. Of the 3 elements that increased poverty rates, child support paid andfederal income taxes had a greater impact on women while medical out of pocket expenditures had a
greater impact on men.

Lastly, I just wanted to point out that even based on their own statistics the percentage of women in
poverty vs men is a small difference even without looking at the smp.It's about 51% of people in poverty
who are women in the official reports. On the other hand, about 70% of the homeless population is
men.So we know that if homeless people were included in there sample then the poverty rates would
undoubtedly be higher for men.

**11 [Women are consistently overmedicated because drug dose trials are based on the typical male
body](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/women-are-overmedicated-because-drug-dosage-trials-are-done-men-study-finds)**

The [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7275616/) used to support this claim does
not actually make a definitive claim that women are consistently overmedicated, and they say this in the
discussion section.

> Although it remains to be definitively established that women routinely are overmedicated, the
present data are consistent with this conjecture for the drugs reviewed here, as well as for the
thousands of drugs administered in equivalent doses to women and men. The intended efficacy of drugs
in relation to sex remains in need of intensive investigation

They also mention a limitation in their study that prevents them from making a definitive claim.

>In all but a few instances, VigiBase contained thousands of ADR reports, but as noted above, the
number of men and women treated with each drug was not specified, nor are the links between the
drug and specific ADRs known. It remains likely that some ADR sex differences in the VigiBase reflect
unequal numbers of women and men treated with a given drug. To definitively establish a cause effect
relation between higher blood drug concentrations and ADRs requires concurrent measurement of PKs
and ADRs in the same subjects.

So what we know is that women typically have higher blood concentration and lower clearance rates of
these drugs compared to men.We also know that women have a higher rate of adverse side
effects.What we don't know for sure is if the drug dosage is the cause of the higher rate of adverse side
effects in women.This study suggest that this is the case, but does not definitively prove that it is.The reason why it can be difficult to determine if sex is a factor that causes higher adverse side effects
from the same drug dose is because there are so many other factors that must be
accounted for. Age, weight,polypharmacy rates, rate of men vs women taking the drug, illnesses,etc.So
this claim that women are overmedicated could be true, but it is currently an unsubstantiated claim.

**12 [Women are more likely to die when the surgeon is a man because female anatomy is not
considered as important as male anatomy](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/04/women-more-likely-die-operation-male-surgeon-study)**

Here is the [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356887012_Association_of_Surgeon-Patient_Sex_Concordance_With_Postoperative_Outcomes) referenced in the article.In the study they
never actually come to a conclusion about the reason for these different postoperative outcomes when
there is sex discordance.So the claim that it's because female anatomy is not considered as important as
male anatomy is an unsubstantiated claim.The study design wouldn't even allow the researchers to
establish causality and that isn't even the purpose of the study.Here is the conclusion of the study.

>This large, population-based study demonstrates a small but significant increase in rates of adverse
postoperative outcomes,defined as the composite of death, complications, or readmission in the 30
days following surgery when there is a sex discordance between surgeons and patients. This is driven by
worse outcomes among female patients treated by male surgeons. These findings support examinations
of surgical outcomes and mechanisms as they relate to physicians and the underlying process and
patterns of care to improve outcomes for all patients.Further sociologic research to evaluate how sex
concordance, among other factors, influences patient-physician relationships,communication, and trust
are warranted.

Also, there are some critique of this study that points out major
flaws.[Here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359430381_Comments_on_Surgeon-Patient_Sex_Concordance_and_Postoperative_Outcomes) is a comment from some researchers
critiquing the study, and here is another
[comment](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/article-abstract/2790415) from a
researcher critiquing the study.So this study cannot be used as valid evidence to back up the claims
being made.

**13 [Women's illnesses go undiagnosed or are frequently brushed of because they only studied
symptoms exhibited by men](https://www.heart.org/en/news/2020/03/06/changing-the-way-we-view-womens-heart-attack-symptoms)**

So first off, the article she presented is only talking about heart attacks so I find the claim being made
here misleading already.It makes you think that the article would be about how women are
misdiagnosed more often in general when this is only about heart attacks.The article references this
[study](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.005948) showing that women
have more symptoms on average then men when they are experiencing a heart attack, and more
variation in unique symptoms they experience.However, what the study shows, and what they also say
in the article, is that the most common heart attack symptom for men and women is chest pain,and
they also say that most diagnosis of men or women are not missed.

>""The growing focus on recognizing that women are more likely than men to demonstrate an array of
symptoms other than chest pain or discomfort when presenting with (heart attack) raises awareness for
patients, but may also unintentionally diminish the message that chest pain is the most common
symptom for both men and women,"" Cook wrote.Brush said people at risk can take comfort knowing
""most of the time, the diagnosis is not missed in either women or men.""

This [metanalysis](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.014733) also shows the same
[results](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.014733).

>Compared with men, women with ACS had higher odds of presenting with pain between the shoulder
blades (OR 2.15; 95% CI, 1.95–2.37),nausea or vomiting (OR 1.64; 95% CI, 1.48–1.82) and shortness of
breath (OR1.34; 95% CI, 1.21–1.48). Women had lower odds of presenting with chest pain(OR 0.70; 95%
CI, 0.63–0.78) and diaphoresis (OR 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76–0.94). Both sexes presented most often with chest
pain (pooled prevalences, men 79%; 95%CI, 72–85, pooled prevalences , women 74%; 95% CI, 72–85).
Other symptoms also showed substantial overlap in prevalence. The presence of sex differences has
been established since the early 2000s. Newer studies did not materially change cumulative findings.

The metanalysis also shows that we have known about sex differences in symptoms of heart attacks for
nearly two decade.There was also this
[study](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.CIR.93.11.1981) that was included in the
metanalysis that was done from 1985-1991 and this study included women.So claiming that we only
studied heart attack symptoms in men is simply not true.Heart attack symptoms in women have also
been studied for decades now.

Now, It is true that there was lack of research done on heart disease in women between the 1950's -
1970's, but this was due to the fact that early studies done in the late 1940's and the 1950's seem to
show that heart disease was not a serious problem for women.So this lead to a lot of studies on heart
disease not including women.However, there has been awareness of this issue since at least the mid
1980's, and there have been efforts made to fix it.You can read more about this
[here](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/191441)

Lastly, I just want to point out the fact that today women have more
[attention](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13685538.2019.1645109) and [funding](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/research/funded-research-and-programs/research-reports/biennial-report)(see table 8 on
pg. 117) given to their health.Even though men have worse health outcomes.So women's health is
definitely not neglected or overlooked today.

**14. [Women are not equally represented in our government on all
levels](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/26/white-male-minority-rule-us-politics-research)**

This is true, but It doesn't necessarily mean that women are discriminated against and this article
doesn't provide proof of discrimination based on sex.The [report](https://wholeads.us/research/system-failure-2020-primary-elections/) that is cited in the article says that incumbency and the partisan
demographic divide are the reason why women are underrepresented in government.The report also
shows that this contributes to the under representation of men of color as well.Rich white men don't
represent the majority of men either.

Also, something else I just wanted to add is that even though the government is compromised of mostly
men, women's interest are prioritized over men's, and I can prove that.There are [multiple offices on
women's health, and small business loans for women owned
buisnesses](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/federal-agency-resources), and [many more female only
programs](https://np.reddit.com/r/Egalitarianism/comments/h9xg40/list_of_female_only_progammes__government_level/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).These resources don't exist for
men.The White House has a [Gender Policy Council](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/08/executive-order-on-establishment-of-the-white-house-gender-policy-council/) that only addresses Women and Girls issues.Here is a

So the [survey](https://stopstreetharassment.org/our-work/nationalstudy/2018-national-sexual-abuse-report/) that statistic comes from was done in the us, and had a sample size of 2,000 people.So the
survey is not generalizable to the whole planet.Also, the survey has some pretty glaring problems like recall bias

>More than half of participants refused or could not recall the timeframe for their most recent sexual
harassment or assault experience, but among those who did, 13% of women and 11% of men said the
most recent experience occurred in the past six months (with higher percentages for younger persons),
and 16% of all respondents said the most recent experience took place in the past five years.

And a broad definition of sexual harrasment.

>Someone whistling, honking, making kissy noises, “Pssst”sounds, or leering/staring aggressively at you.

These are actions that can easily be misinterpreted as being directed towards you.These are very
ambiguous actions not explicit examples of sexual harrasement.Also, u/Oncefa2 made a
[post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/syydbn/knowledge_production_and_epistemic_injustice_a/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) pointing out other issues with the
survey.

**16 [Women are still dealing with high rates of femicide](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/26/femicide-us-silent-epidemic)[,and Over half of the women are murdered by a
romantic partner](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/07/homicides-women/534306/)**

So this article does not actually have a source showing the rate of femicide.Instead the author uses
homicide statistics along with stories of female homicides and assumes that these are all femcides.This
is how we get these inflated femicide statistics.Just to show an example here is the [femicide and child death map](https://theredheartcampaign.org/mapping-femicides/).If you look at the map you will see
that there are many cases of homicide that are missing details of the case, there are also some cases
were women are killed in terrorist attacks were there were also male victims.The motives are also not
mentioned for most of these cases.So these supposed femicides are not homicides cases that have been
thoroughly investigated to determine if they are indeed femicides.They are female homicide cases that
are assumed to be femicides.

Also, u/Hour-Mission7829 made a great
[post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/sf7a69/violence_and_crimes_against_women_are_not_done/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) showing that killing women for their gender is not very likely to be a common motive for why men kill their intimate partners based on the evidence we have.There are many possible motives for why men would kill their intimate partner.Jealousy, infidelity, mental illness, self-defense, etc.So it is not right to make the assertion that all these cases of women being murdered by an intimate partner are femicide.

**17 [Homicide is the 4th leading cause of death for women age
1-19](https://www.cdc.gov/women/lcod/2017/all-races-origins/index.htm#anchor_1571151300)**

So in 2017 homicide was the fourth leading cause of death for females in the 1-19 age range and accounts for 7.4% of deaths in that age range.For [males](https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/lcod/men/2017/all-races-origins/index.htm) in the same year in the 1-19 age range homicide is the third leading cause of death and accounts for 16.9% of deaths in this age range.I'm not sure what the point was here.Homicide is gonna be high on the list of causes of death in this age range [because less young people die in general](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db355.htm) (see figure 3) so homicides would account for a larger percentage of deaths in this age range,and because dying from diseases like heart disease and cancer is less common in this age range.If you look at the cause of deaths overall, homicide isn't even in the top 10 for males or females.As a matter of fact homicide is estimated to account for [less than 1% of deaths globally](https://ourworldindata.org/homicides#the-global-distribution-ofhomicides).So this has nothing to do with gender, and is not a surprising statistic.

274,2wxq7k,2015-02-24,MensRights,Gender roles and a functional society,"When dealing with gender politics I constantly hear how gender roles are terrible things that oppress everyone and lead to everyone being miserable and killing themselves sooner or later but I really don't agree with this. The more I look at gender roles and biology the more I support them as an effective means of running a society.

While I value personal freedom a lot, it seems outright stupid to just reject gender roles all together and label them as a bad thing. Many people in society need a hand in finding their direction in life, this is where gender roles play an important role in society. They are a large part of what separate us from being barbaric savages, they teach us to embrace our differences and to make the most of them, rather than pretending men and women are exactly the same and equal treatment will lead to equal outcomes.

Not only this but I don't think a society can exist without gender roles and the current ones have been the most successful ones in the history of man kind. If we tear down the current ones then society will just pick new up new gender roles and start pushing them. The same way fashion works, this months cool clothing is made uncool and everyone is pressured into supporting the next generation of cool clothing. It is human nature to bully and pressure people who step outside the normal because that is a vital survival strategy, if too many step outside of their box then they risk causing a rebellion and collapsing the stable society. We cannot just remove gender roles and expect humanity to not make up replacement ones almost immediately, we saw this with the demonization of house wives, where the new gender roles became ""be a strong independent woman"" and anything else was looked down on.

I know many MRHM people are looking to destroy gender roles because they think it will help men be freer and feel less guilty about not fitting into them, but I see it as an attempt to collapse a functional society. I believe if we want an effective society that can maintain it's self then we need to promote strengths while minimizing weaknesses. If men are biologically superior in one area to women, we should be putting the resources into bringing the best of that, if women are superior we should be putting the resources into bringing the best of that too. There will always be exceptions and ""mutants"" who break the biological norms, but those people should not be dictating the collapse of a functional society because they feel unhappy in it. I would consider myself one of these mutants, I don't fit society well and expect to meet a negative reaction for doing so, but that is the price I pay for being an outsider and it's a price I'm willing to pay. I don't expect everyone to bow to my needs because I'm the minority not the majority. We have to put the greater good first and i believe gender roles serve far more good than bad. It's like the current push to get more women into STEM, there are ""mutant"" women who love STEM fields and will go into them no matter what, but trying to attract non-mutant into mutant behaviour with bribery is just wasting resources which could be better spent on people naturally interested in STEM, to enhance that batch of people who will do a better job due to natural passion and inclination. 

I would like to discuss this with others, to see their point of view. I used to be very open to gender role dismantling, thinking that everyone should just be free to do whatever they wanted, but the more I think about it and the more I look into the decline of modern society, I'm starting to think we're heading down the completely wrong path to give everyone complete freedom, humanity cannot handle being completely free. It needs direction, it needs purpose, it needs role models and ideals to live up to or it stagnates or worse still becomes degenerate and we end up with pick up culture where every ones a nihilist looking to drink, fuck and smoke themselves into an early grave while adding nothing constructive to society on the whole. If you look at the way gender roles have been removed from women and how many women are now demanding they can act like sluts and still be respected for it like their actions aren't something we should judge them on, I think it makes a valid argument for keeping gender roles. If people acted more conservative sexually and held to the traditional gentleman/lady gender roles then we would have less sexual health problems, less unwanted pregnancies and people would be more concerned with their reputations and would be less likely to give into vices like drink, obesity and drugs. All of which tax the health care industry and (in the UK at least) are a massive drain on the system. If we didn't dismantle gender roles, maybe A&E wouldn't be full of drunk men and women every weekend where they got drunk, fell over and now need to see a doctor to get their arm checked out.

275,fl8xs4,2020-03-19,MensRights,"Pay attention to the side characters in Taylor Swift's ""The Man""","Taylor tries to make sure we all see the character she plays as an entitled male douchebag, even if the behaviour he engages in rarely creates the reactions it claims it does (and bafflingly Taylor shows him being a good dad and apparently celebrating that is bad?) But what this guy really represents is a quarter of 1% of men, hugely wealthy millionaires, a class Taylor belongs to. All of this has been talked about but Taylor can't even help subconsciously exposing the reality in her side characters.

For example, the yacht scene features a dozen woman paid to be, essentially, eyecandy. They get paid to go on a luxury cruise and lay about in bikinis. Meanwhile the male waiter comes out of the sweltering kitchen where the lunches for these models is being made to be chastised and have his work criticized. But Taylor, I thought as a man you never got questioned.

We later see a stripper on a table literally having money doled out to her. Are we meant to feel bad for her being objectified? She's getting thousands for doing nearly nothing.

And again, the wedding is somehow an advantage to the man. Was the woman forced into it? No. She's marrying him for the money. Men are not the only ones with wealth. Very few have wealth close to that, even fewer close to Taylor's. The ability to marry drastically up in wealth is a female privilege that almost never happens to men.

On the manspreading subway shot, Taylor is very careful not to put any white men in but she shows a poor black man, how come he doesn't have all this power and privelege? Eh. Probably just cause he's black. White men never have to take the subway.

This allowes women to work easier jobs with fewer hours, and leads to better health outcomes, longer lives, and a better overall quality of life compared to men.

This money comes from one of three sources:

1. **From welfare and government benefits** that are overwhelmingly paid for by men ([source 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/2kj8qu/the_benefits_gap_a_cursory_analysis_of_us_social/), [source 2](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cpf/publications/pdfs/WP10_2013_Distribution-Income-and-Fiscal-Incidence_18062013.pdf)) but consumed by women ([source 1](https://www.creditdonkey.com/welfare-statistics.html), [source 2](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-97.html)).  It is no surprise that women have consistently voted to expand welfare programs to themselves ([source 1](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~iversen/PDFfiles/LottKenny.pdf), [source 2](http://conference.iza.org/conference_files/ELIT2008/bertocchi_g1882.pdf), [source 3](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30026099?seq=1)), using their own disproportionate political power ([source](http://cawp.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/resources/genderdiff.pdf)), since they are the ones who primarily benefit from it. 

2. **From marriage and dating**.  A tremendous amount of money is transferred from men to women in the form of free food, free entertainment, free rent, bills, and other benefits that women take from men ([source 1](https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/774083/sex-women-spend-money-seduction),  [source 2](https://www.fastcompany.com/1663594/women-dominate-the-global-market-place-here-are-5-keys-to-reaching-them )).  This happens through abuse, manipulation, and by taking advantage of misandrist social norms that are themselves often enforced by women and female preferences in the dating and marriage market (aka *hypergamy*).

3. **From divorce, alimony, and child support**. A legal situation that was largely created and institutionalized by feminists ([source](https://recalculatingthegenderwar.tumblr.com/post/142883164331/most-powerful-american-feminist-organization-kills)) through the disproportionate political power that women have over men ([source](http://cawp.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/resources/genderdiff.pdf)).

####**Encouraging women to support themselves (and criminalizing the usage of men for financial gain) would end the wage gap**

If men were no longer forced into the bread winner role, and women were forced to carry their own financial weight in life, it would cause two things to happen:

1. Women would have a greater incentive to maximize their own earnings potential

2. Men would have less of an incentive to maximize theirs

This would have to be accomplished on two fronts:

1. We would have to eliminate the societal expectation for men to pay for everything for women (including paying for dates and financing mortgages).

2. We would have to fix our divorce and child custody laws so that a woman couldn't take money from a man through divorce or from unfair child support laws.  Give men default 50/50 custody of their kids, and force the mother to support herself and pay for her half of the child rearing costs.

>*""The easiest way to solve the ‘gender pay gap’ would be to make it a criminal offence for a man to financially subsidize ANY woman, even his wife. Then women would have an incentive to work to the best of their earning potential regardless of the wealth of their male spouse.""*

[Source](http://www.fighting4fair.com/uncategorized/the-myth-of-wage-disparity/)

How do we know this would work?  Simple: trends among lesbian and unmarried single women already show this happening.

####**Lesbian and unmarried single women often earn more money because they anticipate that they can't use a man for his money**

Not only has it been shown that lesbian women earn more money than heterosexual women, the academic literature on this topic claims that the primary reason for this is because lesbian women anticipate that they will have to support themselves in the job market.  Since they cannot use a man to subsidize their income, they often make similar choices in the job market that men do ([source](https://wol.iza.org/articles/sexual-orientation-and-labor-market-outcomes/long)).

>Decisions [that lesbian women make] might include staying in education longer, choosing a degree more likely to lead to a higher paying job, working longer hours or choosing a male-dominated career path where average salaries are higher. These choices “differ from those they would have made had they adopted traditional gender-based household specialisation roles"".

A similar phenomenon has been observed in heterosexual women who are young enough to have never been married, as well as among older never married women (who are therefore supporting themselves instead of letting a man take care of them).

In fact, women who pursue their careers the same way that men are often forced to, commonly find that there is ""positive discrimination"" in the labor market that makes it easier for them to find jobs and get promotions compared to men ([source 1](https://www.recruiter.com/i/people-management-finds-widespread-hr-bias-against-men-and-overweight-women/), [source 2](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/112/17/5360.full.pdf), [source 3](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-science-gender/academics-rate-women-job-applicants-higher-than-identical-men-study-idUSKBN0N421420150413?irpc=932)).  As a result, *single women often earn more money than men do* ([source 1](http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2015274,00.html), [source 2](https://www.forbes.com/2006/05/12/women-wage-gap-cx_wf_0512earningmore.html)).

>Without husbands, women have to focus on earning more. They work longer hours, they’re willing to relocate and they’re more likely to choose higher-paying fields like technology. Without children, men have more liberty to earn less–that is, they are free to pursue more fulfilling and less lucrative careers, like writing or art or teaching social studies.

####**But what about ""unpaid labor""? Aren't men essentially paying for a maid or a nanny?**

This assumes two things, both of which I don't think are true.  First, it assumes that this trade-off is voluntary, and not one that is enforced primarily by women, who often prefer to be in charge around the house.  Studies indicate that women very often wrest control from men, *sometimes aggressively*, and that men are forced to take a back seat in most relationships ([source 1](https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle-2-15039/women-decide-to-rule-the-roost-1-1503380), [source 2](https://public.psych.iastate.edu/ccutrona/psych592a/articles/Vogel%202007.pdf)).   And second, it assumes that the amount of work that women do at home is somehow equivalent in value or labor to what they receive from men, which is doubtful given that you can hire a maid or a nanny for *less than minimum wage*.

And even if you do buy these assumptions, it is still advantageous to do an equivalent amount of work from the comfort of your own home instead of out in the real world in the labor market.

Men also do not see this benefit from cases **1** and **3**.  Judges are quick to force a man to pay for his ex-wife (violating his financial and bodily autonomy), but women are never forced to come cook and clean for their ex-husband in return.

Instead I think you'll find that men are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves and their kids ([contrary to misandrist social stereotypes about men that are often enforced by women](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/11401315/At-home-women-treat-men-as-if-they-are-barely-competent.html)), and that the amount of work required to do so is fairly minimal and tends to be exaggerated (in fact a lot of the ""work"" is likely created by, and is primarily for, the wife, and not the husband, which is another topic in and of itself).  

The amount of work that a woman has to put in to make up the difference that she took from a man, however (in terms of job earnings and male labor around the house), is much more substantial, and women are often unwilling to replicate this work themselves (often taking advantage of welfare or money from a divorce).  As such, I think this is a situation that is primarily advantageous to women.  It represents a tremendous amount of privilege that women have in society.  And it is often enforced through hateful gender stereotypes and discriminatory legal practices.",Oncefa2,t2_15it3r,0.97,312,31
