You can ask me anything about regulatory toxicology, the science behind most environmental and occupational exposure scenarios.","[ACS AMA](http://imgur.com/hoKm4RT)

Hi Reddit! My name is Hans Plugge and I am a toxicologist with over 35 years’ experience working on contract both for government, including USEPA, as well as private industry.  Currently I work at 3E Company in their Bethesda, Maryland office, focusing on regulatory toxicology. During most of my career I have specialized in hazard and risk assessment of complex environmental scenarios. Recently I have done a fair amount of work in so-called green toxicology, the art and science of assessing chemicals as to their “greenness”.


Previous government contract experience ranged from review of nasal carcinogens, particulate matter and teratogens to ecotoxicological impacts from drilling muds. Non-federal government/ industry experience ranged from city government (municipal sludge disposal) to state governments (monitoring lab and Superfund activities) to commercial real estate (sick building syndrome, site re-development and asbestos remediation) to (big) data analysis and QC.  At 3E Company, my industry work includes developing GreenScore, hazard assessment software for Green Toxicology, developing and maintaining over a hundred databases of (eco)toxicological data as well as consultations with industry.


I have a B.Sc. in Chemistry from the University of Amsterdam, Netherlands and Master’s degrees in Environmental Biochemistry from the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada and in Toxicology from the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston. I have been with 3E Company for 3 years, prior to that I was a private consultant for 30 years.


Again I am Hans Plugge, a Senior Toxicologist with 3E Company in Bethesda, MD.  You can ask me anything about regulatory toxicology, the science behind environmental and occupational exposure scenarios.

We're a group of scientists and advocates who believe that the traditional genetics research model is outdated. We think that people who participate in genetic studies should be involved in decision-making, that research projects should collaborate, that samples should be diverse, and that studies should use real world data. We need these changes to improve our ability to discover treatments and cures for diseases. But at the same time, researchers also need to ensure participant privacy, data security, and give participants the chance to weigh in on and directly benefit from research- medically, informationally, and financially. Let's discuss!

I am a chemist, a materials chemist by training. After my BA, MA and DPhil degrees in Oxford I spent nearly two years doing neutron scattering research in the Physics Department of Tohoku University in Japan. Deciding then to come to the US, I had to decide first between an academic or industrial track. Choosing the latter, I joined ExxonMobil Corporate Research in New Jersey, where I was fortunate to be able to work on inorganic materials for a range of interesting applications, including ceramics, catalysts, zeolites, and oxide superconductors. I got interested in computer simulation and was then recruited by Biosym Technologies, a molecular simulation software company in San Diego. I had various executive roles, including Chief Scientific Officer, as the company was acquired by Corning, merged with Molecular Simulation, and was acquired by Pharmacopeia (now [Biovia DS](http://accelrys.com/)). I then became more interested in start-up and early phase companies, co-founding [FreedomVoice Systems](https://www.freedomvoice.com/), [hte AG](http://www.hte-company.com/en), fqubed, Integrated Discovery Sciences, Bio4Front and, in 2011, Tioga Research.


I also serve as an [ACS Expert](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/experts/john-newsam.html) an AAAS Fellow and a RSC Fellow; I enjoy teaching entrepreneurship to undergraduates at UCSD and discussing with local middle- and high-schoolers interested in chemistry.

I am currently CSO of Collaborative Drug Discovery, CEO of Phoenix Nest, CEO of Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, Inc and CSO of the Hereditary Neuropathy Foundation and I am on the Editorial Board of Pharmaceutical Research.  I am a graduate (MSc, PhD, DSc) of the University of Aberdeen. I have spent 20 years working in the USA, first as a postdoc at Eli Lilly, then as a senior scientist at Pfizer and Lilly before joining smaller start-up companies. I then went on to co-found and found two rare and neglected disease companies.

My background is in clinical pharmacology, with an interest in understanding drug-drug reactions and toxicology. I quickly moved from doing bench work to learning how to use computational approaches to make predictions that could help drug discovery.

Over the years I have collaborated with different academics and companies to build models that help predict how compounds bind to enzymes, transporters, ion channels and receptors. As the datasets have grown I have applied different machine learning approaches.

My work in the last 8 years has brought me into working on neglected diseases like tuberculosis and rare diseases such as Sanfilippo syndrome and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Again collaborations are central to what I do. Virtually everything I work on is funded by a grant whether from the NIH, EU or others so even though I am not working in a university I am constantly working on small business or other grants.

Most recently my work has led to projects and collaborations on the Ebola and Zika viruses. All of this has been published openly and I am an advocate of open access publishing as well as using social media to publicize science. I believe it’s important for scientists to use tools like Twitter to tell the world about their work, conferences they are attending and publications.

We help chemists around the world discover new antibiotics, ask me anything about antimicrobial resistance, the empty antibiotic discovery pipeline and the ‘superbug’ crisis. AMA!","Hi Reddit! I’m Mark Blaskovich, the Program Coordinator for Hit Validation & Chemistry for the Community for Open Antimicrobial Drug Discovery (CO-ADD, see www.co-add.org). I’m also a Senior Research Officer at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at The University of Queensland in Australia. The goal of CO-ADD is to empower the community of synthetic chemists to discover new antibiotics. We provide free screening against five bacteria and two fungi, and are actively seeking out compounds to test from chemists around the world. Any compounds that show activity undergo further assays, and all the results are the property of the compound submitter.
 
My background is medicinal chemistry – I got my PhD in synthetic chemistry developing syntheses of unusual amino acids, and published a book on amino acid synthesis (Handbook on Syntheses of Amino Acids, Oxford University Press). I worked for ten years for a couple of biotech companies in Seattle, a peptidomimetic company developing GPCR ligands and protease inhibitors (Molecumetics) and a company focused on protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (CEPTYR).  I then crossed the ocean to become Chief Operating Officer at Mimetica (Australia), where I managed the drug discovery and development program for melanocortin-5 receptor antagonists. This work led to a compound currently in Phase II human trials for the treatment of acne. Since 2010 I’ve been working at The University of Queensland, developing new antibiotics to treat drug resistant pathogens and helping to set up CO-ADD. I’ll be giving a talk about CO-ADD and our antibiotic discovery efforts at the [C&EN virtual symposium on Advances in Drug Discovery and Development on Sept 16](http://engage.vevent.com/index.jsp?eid=782&seid=1319&code=CENEmail1).

I’m Dr. Joseph Glajch and I currently work as the Director of Analytical Development for Momenta Pharmaceuticals.  Our company specializes in complex medicines and complex mixtures of different drugs are we are now heavily involved in biosimilars (which are follow-on versions of biological drugs).  This is a relatively new area in the United States, since these were just given a path for approval as part of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (also known as ObamaCare).  Biosimiliars by their very nature are not a single molecule, but a mixture of hundreds or thousands of variants of the same basic protein, which makes them difficult to produce and analyze.  Our company has developed a wide range of processes and analytical techniques to make this happen and we hope to develop and gain approval for these biosimilars in order to expand access to these medicines at significantly reduced cost to the consumers and health care system.

I am an analytical chemist by training having received an A.B. in Chemistry at Cornell University and a PhD in Analytical Chemistry at the University of Georgia.  After graduate school, I spent many years in a variety of positions at DuPont and then Bristol-Myers Squibb when they acquired the pharmaceutical division of DuPont in 2001.  I have worked in process chemical research, biochemistry, analytical, and pharmaceutical chemistry prior to coming to Momenta in 2008.  I also serve as an ACS Expert and am involved with the US Pharmacoepia (USP) on a number of panels and committees.  I have also written a number of papers and three books on method development for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Ask me anything about biosimilars or what it’s like for chemists to work in the private sector – including some roles that are “non-traditional” compared to chemistry lab work.

Hi Reddit! I am Randall Murch, a Research Lead for Office of the Vice President, National Capital Region, and Professor of Practice, School of Public and International Affairs (http://www.spia.vt.edu/), at Virginia Tech (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University). I am based in Arlington, VA, not on our main campus in Blacksburg, VA.

I am in my second career at Virginia Tech. For my first career, I was a Special Agent and Senior Executive, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice for nearly 23 years. I had field investigative assignments in Indianapolis, IN, Los Angeles, CA early on (primarily national security investigations) and then mid-career in New York, NY (technical operations). I also served in the FBI (Forensic) Laboratory for 10 years as: a forensic biologist (crime scenes, method development and validation, casework lab analysis, reporting, courtroom testimony, providing training), research scientist (human DNA analysis), department head (biological, chemical, materials, physical sciences, firearms and explosive devices) and deputy director for science in the FBI (Forensic) Laboratory. For ca. 8.5 years, I was assigned to various positions in the Technical Investigative Program: as a technical operations planning officer (FBI Headquarters), engineering technology development unit chief (Quantico, VA), technical operations squad supervisor (New York) and deputy division director (Quantico, VA). I led the forensic and technical support to many major terrorism investigations and special events while in the FBI. 

I retired from the FBI in November 2002 and then worked for a Government “think tank” for two years. I have been at Virginia Tech since December 2004. I have extensive knowledge and with the development and operational use of science and technology as it relates to law enforcement, and national, homeland and global security, including at the interfaces of science and technology, operations, policy and law, as well as strategic program development and implementation. I have spent much of the last 20 years focusing on major events, terrorism, and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) terrorism and proliferation. While in the FBI I led the creation of the first—ever WMD forensic investigative program, which originated in the FBI Laboratory in 1996 and now encompasses a number of Federal agencies, national laboratories, universities and companies and collaborates with foreign governments worldwide and has many aspects to it. While in the Government and since from the university, I have worked with many Federal agencies with a variety of missions, foreign governments, and international agencies. I have served on a number of advisory boards and committees, including at the U.S. National Academies (study committees and reports on: establishing homeland security science and technology; advancing life science and technology and impacts on national and global biosecurity; nuclear forensics; improving the U.S. forensic science system; and, defense programs related to chemical and biological defense).

Currently my research and program development interests include: biosecurity and counter-bioterrorism; chemical and biological defense (including biosurveillance); advancing forensics and attribution technology, operational capabilities and policy relating to WMD (mainly bio); advancing general forensic science and policy; and understanding and developing solutions at the intersection of biosecurity and cybersecurity.
I have a B.S. degree from the University of Puget Sound, Tacoma WA, a M.S. degree in Botanical Sciences from the University of Hawai’i at Manoa, and a PhD degree in Plant Pathology from the University of Illinois, Urbana – Champaign.

You can ask me anything about the technical investigative aspects of catastrophic and WMD terrorism (and how agencies work together for preparedness and response), forensics and attribution of biological weapons/bioterrorism/biological weapons proliferation (I know something about chemical, radiological and nuclear weapons/terrorism too), biodefense, biosecurity, how forensic science relates to investigations, prosecutions and exonerations, forensic science policy, and the current state of forensic science (and where improvements are needed).

246,6uumes,2017-08-20,MensRights,Fuck office politics: newly arrived female coworker is in difficulty with her work and is attacking my reputation behind my back. WTF???,"The reason I post here is because many of the things this coworker does she can get away with it because she's a woman, and she's blatantly using female shaming tactics (people may not agree with the fact these are female tactics, but I think they are), *in the workplace*, to get her way...

She had a task: do her job and learn ho to do new things. Me (and others) supported her. After a few months I no longer had the obligation to support her and I realized she was slacking on purpose (facebook, amazon, chats, etc, instead of working). She... didn't like that. Because she had decided *not* to learn anything, when push came to shove and she needed to deliver, she went mad and started using the only coin at her disposal to fight the situation: social group, gossip, men-hating.

She started attacking me behind my back, trying to ruin my reputation. Her reasoning was that our boss was pressuring her to deliver, she didn't know how to do the job (spent months without applying herself) and because I was capable of doing it, *I had to drop everything for her*.

To quote her (a coworker showed me this):

- ""why doesn't Demian do it instead of me? He's the only one who knows how to do it anyway..."".
- ""I'm stuck with this, the *client* is an asshole, it's not clear what I have to do... of course it would be a lot easier if Demian supported me, but he never helps me...""
- ""this job is shit, can't do it... talk to me about your weekend :)""
- ""I asked X to give me a hand, I'm waiting for him. I watched this cool movie last night...""

Again and again, complaints in private to her friend (one of the PMs) in order to get someone to tell me to do the job *for her*. Never mentioning how she was told, when hired, that *she needed to learn this stuff*! Only implying how she's willing to do the job but my lack of support is blocking her (false and shameless accusation)...

She decided by herself that team work meant she was excempted from every responsibility. This is an example of a chat conversation:

- SHE: demian, you are not busy, right? :)
- ME: I'm busy, sorry.
- SHE: eh... you are doing research... can't you help me with this?
- ME: sorry, but I can't help you. Try to take it slowly and face one problem at a time, you'll get there.
- SHE: but I need someone to show me how it's done...
- ME: and I sent you lots of material months ago, I can't do the job for you..

She grabbed the last message and send it to four different women and a guy so they could support her in bashing me.

I had to protect myself after that. I intervened with certain coworkers and made sure my version was known. After a few days, she made so much noise and her work was so behind that my boss asked me my opinion on her and her work. 

Because of what she did (the chat convo was just one occurrence of her gossip), I sunk her in front of my boss. I spent almost 8 months without saying anything negative about a coworker (her!) in order to avoid putting her in a difficult spot, and what does she does?

She targets me because I don't go over mountains for her (where does the entitlement come from lol????) and decides to fuck with my reputation, just because she was lazy and had to choose between admitting her lack of knowledge to my bosses (damage to her image) or use social games to blame *me* instead (damage to *my* image)...

-------

Right now, I was promoted and next month I'll be in charge of her work. At the moment, she latched onto another coworker, constantly ""asking"" him how to do things, constantly ""asking"" him to look up stuff for her by saying ""she doesn't know how to do the job..."", and implying he has to because of ""team work""...

While the guy looks for stuff up, she opens her chat or facebook and starts doing random stuff or talking with her friends, waiting for him. And the spineless guy refuses to say ""no"" to her, is depressed and overloaded of work all day, and earns even less than she does...

And by the way, whenever the guy can't cope with it anymore and snaps at her, she starts gossiping behind his back telling everyone how this guy is having his ""ladies days""...

The three of us were on the same role inside the company, but unlike us, who focused on the job, she focused on her relationship with the others. At first I thought this wouldn't be an issue because we are all different, until she started using that ""support group"" she formed to backup her up on her lack of skills and all her BS...

Fucking office politics. And fuck women who blatantly push to establish social bonds with other women and then use gossip to get their way against men who actually work and don't give a crap about this stuff...",demian78,t2_ax22xax,0.89,936,219

Specifically PM work. I was let go in the mass layoffs months ago by a major tech company that all of you probably know of. I have been in multiple interview rounds with good companies and I have never seen the market this bad for white men ever in my adult career.

Just to preface without sounding like gloating, I have a good resume with solid experience from desirable companies. I've had a number of interviews, and for the positions I want, most hiring managers/majority of panel interviewers have been women, either white or minorities. And oddly enough, every single time I reach the final stages of the interview process and I find myself interviewing with one of these women in a position of power, I get a swift rejection email.

I am cordial, well spoken and friendly. I received two offers from interviews, with the hiring managers/majority of panel members being men but unfortunately they are not companies I am very interested in.

**Two alarming trends I have noticed in tech are that being a white man is an instant negative for most companies**, especially if you find yourself in front of a panel of women or a hiring manager who is a woman. Women are also being promoted to these HM positions in much less time than their male counterparts.

**The other is underqualified women are getting these jobs that white men are competing for at increasing rates.** I checked back for the roles I was rejected for that have been filled and, unsurprisingly, all but one of them were filled by women with less experience than I have.

Just wanted to let other men (white men specifically) that are struggling know that you aren't alone. You don't meet the quotas that these companies have and you are playing against a stacked deck. This is the worst I have ever seen it, and I can only assume it will get worse. I have spoken with close friends and they are experiencing the same thing.

There is evidence of a growing number of men, who avoid women in the workplace, avoid being one on one, avoid mentoring women. This hurts women. 

https://nypost.com/2019/05/17/men-are-afraid-to-mentor-women-after-metoo-and-it-hurts-us-all-study/

I read a number of articles on that topic. Another example:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/pragyaagarwaleurope/2019/02/18/in-the-era-of-metoo-are-men-scared-of-mentoring-women/

There is a common pattern. Authors ignore and dismiss concerns of men, they give their own explanations of the experiences, feelings and motives of these men, in condescending and scolding manner and shift the topic to empowering women, defeating bias against women and improving career opportunities for women. So basically men should shut up, stop whining and do their best to help women advance. I'd say, it is basically womansplaining.

I know, that feminism is about women's issues, not about troubles of men. That's fair enough, I totally accept this approach. So let's assume these papers are supposed to fix the problem for women, defeat the backlash against metoo. However, let's see what kind of message does it deliver to these men, who are afraid of women at the workplace? 

Men aren't listened to. Their concerns and point of view are ignored. Men aren't entitled to be treated with dignity and feeling of security. Men are an instrument for the advance of  women... 

So if a man is afraid of women, he receives a message that his fears are completely valid.

Edit:

So. How would you approach that problem (men silently ignoring women, because they are afraid)?",WanabeInflatable,t2_16k72e,0.97,1717,370

267,odi2ma,2021-07-04,MensRights,"""Emotional labour"" is the term women use when they emotionally abuse men.","After reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/lums86/woman_realizes_shes_been_accidentally_abusing_her/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), I started thinking about the all too common story of the husband who has no self-confidence left. Reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ocxwrc/why_are_so_many_women_unaware_of_the_emotional/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), however, really set me off to writing this post.

""[Emotional labor](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/emotional-labor-in-the-workplace/202004/emotional-labor-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not) is the regulation of one’s feelings at one’s job."" Although, as acknowledged by the article linked, the meaning has been stretched to mean, ""[Women planning things.](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/)""

Both cases of ""emotional labour"" (and all other cases that include its stretched definition) have one thing in common: an abusive woman.

Picture this: You're a husband who works a job, and are trying to help around the house. Good for you, right? Except, before anything else, you'll be [berated](https://www.katykatikate.com/the-blog/2019/5/7/so-you-want-to-help-around-the-house) for not being a perfect mind-reading magician and doing so earlier. 

Then comes the fun part: Nothing you do will satisfy her. You'll be scolded and called ""incompetent"" for getting the tiniest of details wrong. You're not good enough, and you never will be. Not unless you read her mind perfectly, because she can't bother explaining things to you; she shouldn't have to.

Any confidence you had in yourself is gone, and you stop doing those things you wanted to; you always get them wrong, anyways. This is the real kicker: Now you'll be blamed for not doing enough. You're now a lazy bum, a manchild, a mama's boy. You depend on her for everything, and she can't take it, so she takes it out on you. ""I don't have to ask you to help! You should know already!"". That's the part that gets you. ""You should know already."" You should already know what she needs help doing. You should already be doing the thing. You should already know exactly how to do the thing, to the last detail. You should already know all that, and the only reason you don't is because you're not good enough.

But oh no, you're not the victim in all this; she is, because she's doing the ""emotional labour"". Stop thinking your feelings are valid; they're just a manifestation of your ""fragile male ego"" that ""needs constant appeasing"". She doesn't need to caress your ego. You need to be the man she needs you to be, because you're not good enough.",Hey_itsmeguys,t2_a3edilh8,0.86,1732,314
269,11asgcb,2023-02-24,MensRights,Women need to be called out on their hypocritical use of sexuality in the workplace,"Why does nobody has the balls to call this out?!

Women use their sexuality in work and work related settings ALL THE TIME. When they want a favor from a coworker, when they need help, when they are looking for a raise or promotion, when they are trying to get a new client/customer.

I had several dates with highly successful beautiful business women and they all laughingly admit of flirting and leading coworkers or clients/customers on in order to get that sale, promotion or just get it ""their way"". Had a date where the female CEO said if the client is a man, she sends one of her hot employees, always. And i myself -of course- over the years first hand have seen women get all girly and sexy, start using their cute girly voice when they need a favor or whatever. Its so blatant and normal, everyone knows it.

Yet women flip the fuck out when a man tries to be flirty or tries to use sexuality in their favor. They act like its an  unthinkable immoral crime that needs to be punished. If you ask women if sexuality belongs in the workplace, they all say ABSOLUTELY NOT. Yet they use it every single fucking day. Hell women told me they dress sexier for clients when they want to get a deal/sale. They flirt, they drop sexual suggestions only to later shoot the man they led on down. This all would be fine...if they weren't hypocrites that literally try to cancle and destroy men who dare to flirt back or god forbid initiate a flirt.

Coworker or customer flirts with woman at work = Oh god look at that creepy piece of shit. He should be reported and fired, this doesn't belong in the workplace.

Woman flirts to get a sale, favor, promotion, raise = you go girl, hate the game not the player.",todoke,t2_3ovuh,0.95,741,105

272,b04wtm,2019-03-12,MensRights,Lost my job because I was targeted for being a white male,"I'm a 33 year old white male, and I am a mental health counsellor. I worked on a team with 4 other females, all counsellors/social workers/etc. On that team was a 23 year old who made her opinions about men very clear. Back in August she presented my manager with a list of things that I had said that offended her. I had no idea I was saying anything that offended her. There was about 6 things on this list, and many of them were just me expressing a different opinion than her. It was certainly never my intention to offend anyone with these opinions, and they weren't racist or sexist or derogatory. I've shown this list to many people, including many women, some of whom said they disagreed with some of my opinions, but none said they were worth complaining about. What's worse is this individual took the things I said, and twisted them, either misquoting them or taking them completely out of context, to make me look a certain way. I don't think she did this intentionally, I do believe this is what she heard me say as my words went through her filter. 

She took it to the manager, who is a female and has also demonstrated having a negative bias towards men. For this reason, I was not offered the chance to tell my side of the story; I was ignored when pointing out that I didn't say these things the way she is saying I did. I was offended, and pointed out to my manager that other people on the team, including the woman who presented this list and my manager herself, have made comments that I could have complained about should I have wanted to. My manager has also commented on my appearance more than once, which is sexual harassment, and I reminded her of this (although I didn't put it that way). I stated that I felt this was incredibly hypocritical, but it didn't matter; I was sent to anti-racism anti-oppression training, one-on-one with a trainer chosen by my manager. I showed him the list, told him my side, and he said, in his professional opinion of doing this for 20+ years, that he felt I'm being singled out and I'm being sent to this training to be ""fixed"" so I'll go back to work, shut my mouth and be quiet. He believed this was a team issue being turned into a me issue, and I agreed. This was in September. In November we met with this trainer as a team. It was uncomfortable. I expressed my fear of sharing an opinion that someone disagrees with lest it be held against me at a later time. But we did the training, and things went back to normal. My working relationship with this young woman was never the same, but it was civil. 

Flash forward 3 months, when I am sitting in my office waiting for my first client of the day, and my manager and an hr rep entered my office and told me I am being let go because I ""don't fit in"" and that my ""views are better suited elsewhere."" It was out of nowhere. I had been so careful with everything I had said since August. I received no warning, no investigation, no opportunity to fight for my job. It was decided.

I have dedicated my life to helping others. I do not discriminate against anyone, quite the opposite in fact. I help individuals of all genders, sexual orientations, races, religions, ethnicities, ages and so on. I help many people who have been discriminated against, oppressed, or stigmatized. But I was on a team with a 23 year old female who only ever saw me as a white male, and she targeted me, and she was successful. She has had an impact on me financially, on my career, and a severe impact on my mental health. I hate her, and I hate my biased manager who handled the situation different than she would have if the roles were reversed. This is a scary time.

Edit: I should have mentioned I consulted an employment lawyer. He is a friend of a friend, so I trust him and his advice. He said that although I likely have a case of discrimination, he strongly suggested I don't take legal action on the basis of discrimination, due to the fact that I am straight, white and male. He said that win or lose the case, it would reflect bad on me, particularly in the field that I work in.

The list:
-age (she was the youngest on the team by 10 years. Myself, and the rest of the team, would occasionally playfully tease her about her age. I never once put her down because of it. At a team meeting she asked all of us to stop it, and I know I did. And yet, it still made the list) -he said that questions about power and privilege on interviews are useless (in fact, I said ""I didn't see the point"" but I was referring to one specific case, but that's a whole other story. But she generalized it, and that was not my intention or meaning nor my words) - mat leave (the women on the team were having a conversation about how the US was cutting parental leave time and were talking about how sexist it is. I said I don't think it's fair to call it sexist because, although it disproportionately affects women, it affects all genders who would take parental leave) -said he wanted another male on the team; ""there are too many of you and only one of me"" (at a team meeting we were talking about hiring a new person for the team, I suggested we consider hiring another male as some clients request male counsellors specifically and because I felt it might add some more diversity to the team. I was often shut down very quickly if the women on the team did not agree with my opinion. I certainly did not say the words she put in quotation marks) -you look nice (said to her ONE TIME in the year I worked with her before she gave this list, because she got dressed up for a presentation and I was just trying to be nice. I didn't think anything of it. I certainly wasn't hitting on her or flirting with her, and again, it was a one time occurence)
-he is aggressive when his point is not agreed with and does not take into account other people's feelings (in fact, I would often be shown aggression from the females on my team. When I suggested hiring another male, the 23 year old snapped at me ""you can't say that!!"" and she clearly did not take into account my feelings.

######Credit: u/FelineQuinine

Notice how 93% of workplace fatalities are still men.  A fact that men apparently do not get compensated for.

~~The math is pretty simple, though not obvious at first:~~

~~$1 / ($1 + $0.77) = 0.56~~

I think this shows pretty clearly what the largest factor in the earnings gap is.

Of course the fact that men have to work longer hours than women is itself a problem. Paying for dates and bills for your girlfriend / wife isn't exactly cheap. Not to mention that many women look for men who earn more money, thus creating an incentive for men to sacrifice their work-life balance in order to earn more.

I guarantee most men would love to work fewer hours and spend more time at home but the spending and earning patterns of their partners don't often facilitate this.

This also contributes to poorer health outcomes for men and the fact that men die 5 years earlier than women on average.

**Edit:** Graph is fine, title is misleading.  The 77 cents per dollar thing is likely just a colloquialism at this point.

I’m not joining the club. 

I can’t take you seriously if the word entitlement isn’t paired with responsibility. Start explaining what you are responsible for. 

I don’t care if you wear a bra. Why is this still a thing ? Do what you want. 

I don’t need to hear anything related to your reproductive cycle, we are not a couple so why do you feel like sharing publicly. Sharing is not caring. Your body is your business. 

If you take the time to creat list and be thoughtful do it silently. Telling others about the emotional labor you endured takes away from any generosity you supposedly offered. 

If women are still too sexualized it’s because too many of your sisters are looking for  a short cut. Deal with them, not me. 

If a man shares a thoughts or a feeling let him finish it. Talking isn’t a competitive sport. Emotions are real and not icons in your chat app. Let a man express himself  once in a while. And listen once in a while. 

And lastly, if men are so bad why do you glom onto them as if they are owed to you. No man owes you anything, least of all a relationship if he isn’t ready for one. Or if you are not the one.

in full disclosure, i'm a white male, in a creative industry that is being regulated and run by media companies with a heavy woke agenda. i've been working my way up the ladder for 15 + years now and i'm constantly seeing job offer listings with the heading ""(BIPOC) preferred."" make no mistake about it, media companies have an agenda to hire diversity. AKA, anybody but WHITE MALES.

women and people of color are being hired with no experience and being promoted up the chain overnight, something i've been working years to achieve. Further, the older white male bosses, know they're in the cross hairs and can be cancelled any minute and are terrified they are going to lose their rarified high paying job, and are as one boss told me ""making me hire"" diverse candidates, over ability, loyalty and experience.

It's not only the corporate media initiatives on the hiring side, but it's also the content - the content is all about women issues, with trans subject matter. So if you have netflix, hulu, disney, etc. you must notice that all your content is starring women and about women's issues and LBGQT subjects, etc.

Nevermind that Top Gun - an arguably patriotic, male, testosterone, action movie has done billions of dollars in GLOBAL revenue for these same companies.

You'll notice the jobs i'm speaking of are not -- plumbers, construction, electrical, truck driving, HVAC -- fields that women have no interest in, that require specialized skill and intensive labor. These are creative jobs where the only SKILL you have to have is be able to feel and relate as a woman or diverse person of color. Experience, skill be damned. The question USED TO BE ""what experience do you have?"" now the question is ""what gender and ethnicity are you?""

Further, my bosses on my last shows were ALL WOMEN (making million dollar salaries). so the notion that women are being subjugated and oppressed and dont have any mobility or opportunities, is patently false.

if i'm my own critic? hey it's social darwinism.  the times are changing, bud!  and get used to it, pal! The patriarchy is over!

but it's a tough pill to swallow. And I am angry and fed up. i'm just a guy who works his ass off and is being pushed to the back of the line because of my gender and skin color.

I'm not sure what to do. I feel like i have to leave my dream and go elsewhere. Become a grey man and disappear. But it's happening. and I'm not sure how to adapt. But I'm in boiling water now and i dont expect it to change.

It was one of those ""we're one big family"" tech companies who prided itself on having beer in the fridge and a ""great culture"". 

The management structure above me was my lead (female), mid level manager (female), direct manager (female), and department head (male). The HR department was 3 people (all female). For what it's worth, I am also an ethnic minority and all the women in management were white women. 

Myself, a female colleague, and another male colleague were all up for a promotion. The only one that walked away with a promotion was my female colleague, despite myself and my male colleague being there far longer (I actually interviewed and made the call to hire the person who was promoted). The company had a formal list of criteria needed for a promotion, so I created a list with evidence for every bullet point and sent it to my manager. She refused to even glance at it and told me my accomplishments were not relevant. Weeks later I pleaded with her to go over this document and discuss my career goals. She flipped out on me, called me all kinds of names, and then stormed off. 

I went to the head of the department and explained what had happened. He was shocked at the behavior and had no idea what was going on in the department. He scheduled a meeting with the three of us and she tried to lay into me again, but instead her boss chewed her out for unprofessional behavior. He then saw my list of accomplishments and decided I was definitely in line for a promotion and I was promoted not long after, along with my male colleague. I thought it was over. Boy was I wrong.

A few months later the department head left the company and was replaced by a female department head (so the entire management structure was female). My boss held a grudge and it was open season on me now. But this time she stepped over the line and harassed me over email with direct language about a disability I have. This is blatantly illegal so I went to HR. 

They immediately defended her and tried to gaslight me. Everything I said they tried to counter, until I presented them with the harassment in writing. I stood firm and knew my rights and they backed down. What transpired after that was 6 months of retaliation (I spoke to a lawyer and he said there's not much you can do until they fire you). 

Constant belittling, talking bad about me to other coworkers, turning people against me. Every 1 on 1 meeting we had was recorded (something she never did to anyone else). Every time I pushed this up the all female chain of command it fell on deaf ears. Eventually I left the company, just like they wanted. My position was filled by my boss's female friend. I am told by someone that still works there she had been badmouthing me behind my back for over 2 years.

Keep in mind this is a company where other female employees openly said they discriminated against men. They host and sponsor feminist events. They openly say their pride themselves on hiring women. 

When I reported my manager for harassment, it was me against a clique that openly made it clear where they stand, and that stance was firmly against men.

What can I do??,"I used to think the whole battle between feminism and men’s rights was overblown or not a problem in the UK, but I've now seen just how disgusting it is...


The company used to run two sessions, teaching in total about 300 kids each weekend, one for paying families and a free one for families with low income. They are now scrapping the paying one and changing the criteria for the free one to include girls, but not boys.

These kids are 7-11 years old and have no clue and don’t care about sexism or gender shit. And now boys have literally no way of going to these classes. I know families where a 9 year old brother and 11 year old sister attended the paying class, now that it's scrapped, the sister goes for free and the brother is denied entry. I've seen a mother try to explain to her son why ""It's a good thing that they're being inclusive and that he can no longer go to the classes""... It doesn't matter if you think there is a problem with people/genders/whatever’s being under represented, this is clearly not a solution at all!!!

My immediate boss was a pushy woman who did not understand the concept of boundaries. For example, she made telephone calls at all hours. I immediately make friends and one of the people I got very friendly with was a woman - we totally had no romantic interest in each other - and she acted more like a drinking buddy.

For some reason my boss did not like to see this friendship. For example every day, I had lunch with my female friend. But my boss warned both me and her that we were spending too much time together and I needed to spend time with people who were more knowledgeable in the work we were doing.

My boss started to call me over to her office on the pretense of explaining something or asking about progress on some project I was working on but she started flirting a lot and this involved her putting her hand on my thigh, near my crotch. Her language was also vulgar and amongst other things she made 'jokes' like asking me what size shoes I wore because according to her penis size is related to shoe size.

I sent her an email, copied in to our male, gay manager, outlining her behaviour and why I thought it was inappropriate.

I was horrified when I was fired but doubly so when she reported me to the police for lying about her and tarnishing her reputation! Incredibly the police are taking action against me.

Edit: Please understand that I cannot give more detailed information such as location etc. Others are asking me questions like what can the police do... etc. But I would rather not reply publicly as it might compromise my position and my future course of action. I thank you all for your support.

Women complains that man keeping it professional at work makes her and other female coworkers feel uncomfortable","The other day I was bored and started doomscrolling on Reddit when I found this post on r/relationship_advice 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/10yx39j/a\_colleague\_at\_work\_27m\_of\_1\_year\_refuses\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10yx39j/a_colleague_at_work_27m_of_1_year_refuses_to/)

Essentially the post is about how some dude in the office (27M) won’t speak to OP (24F) and the other women at the office. He won’t talk with them about anything other than work with the girls, but is friends with the guys. However, he is cordial and will exchange some basic pleasantries (have a good day etc). In other words, he is being a normal coworker and OP doesn’t like that.

Now here’s the twist. OP said that one of the girls is considering go to HR about this because she is saying its creating a hostile work environment. This is the part that really pissed me off. Now I acknowledge that maybe the majority of women aren't like this, don't generalize blah blah blah I get it. However, it's not that every woman will, but that any woman can. This is the exact same situation as the google manager in a thread that got posted a while back where the guy got fired for not responding to a female coworker's advances. So the idea that this is an impossible scenario is simply false.

There is simply no winning anymore. Now if you follow the Pence rule, you can be punished for that to.   Act friendly with a woman and ask her out or show interest, and you get punished or fired for harassment. Okay. Men adapt. Now, you act professional with a woman, and her and her friends get upset that this is a hostile work environment and want to report this to HR. If a man does A he gets in trouble. If he does B he gets in trouble. If he reverses course and does Z or Y he gets in trouble as well. If he says f the system it's all BS and goes MGTOW, then he gets labelled incel, misogynist, sexist.

It is promising however that pretty much everyone in the thread called OP out for her total BS, but the simple fact that a group of women would even think to do this is just insane. I suspect (this is just my opinion) that the man is attractive, she showed interest, he says no thanks let's talk about work, and she takes it personally and builds a *hostile work environment* in her mind because she can't fathom that someone doesn't want to be best buddies with her *at work* and just wants to be professional. More attention-seeking bullshit. Nobody is entitled to friendship to anyone, but somehow this is too much to comprehend for some people. Imagine being so fragile that someone not being your best friend makes you feel uncomfortable. It honestly seems to me that she and the other girls at the office are harassing him. Rules for thee but not for me. I shoot you for no reason, but I am the victim.

Imagine if a group of guys went to HR and said, ""we feel upset that a female coworker at the office won't talk with us"". They would be annihilated. This is just complete delusion.

&#x200B;

This LinkedIn study from 2019 used their internal data to examine differences between men and women when job searching. Among the key findings are the fact that men and women view a similar number of jobs though women apply to 20% fewer. A recruiter is 13% more likely to view a man's profile which she described as result of a problematic bias that must be corrected (even though they also found that recruiters will still contact both genders at equal rates).

However, the author (Maria Ignatova) makes no effort to hide her own bias (and sexism) by writing:

>The good news is that when women do apply to a job, they are 16% more likely than men to get hired. In fact, if the role is more senior than their current position, that number goes up to 18%.  
>  
>While this is an uplifting stat, it does show that women do a very thorough job at vetting roles — sometimes maybe too thorough. If women only apply when they feel extremely qualified, this could also indicate they are not pursuing stretch opportunities.

Linkedin is a mainstream website, not a fringe feminist blog. Yet blatant discrimination in hiring practices is celebrated as ""good news"" and as ""uplifting stat(s)"". This doesn't lead to equality, it's just another piece of evidence that equality isn't the actual goal.

Her analysis is also very weak and uses the usual strategy of reframing all issues so that women are the real victims. I think a more plausible hypothesis for why men apply to 20% more jobs is because if we are getting rejected more often then we need to submit more applications to increase our chances of finding work. Of course I would submit fewer if I was getting offers at 16-18% higher rate.

For most of us, this is just seeing statistics that support what we already knew is happening. The worst part is just being gaslit, and told this is ""equality"" and if we have a problem with it we are misogynist or examples of ""toxic masculinity"".

I live on the property of a private boat club, the property is gated, fenced, and has no trespassing signs all over. I live here to keep non-members out of the property as we are located on the water in a large park. 

Tonight I come home from work and do my walk around the property, as I do everyday, and I came across to young women sunbathing on one of the docks. I asked if they were members, they said no, and asked the to politely leave because this is private property. That's when they started to call me a perv, they can do what thay want, on and on. I am a very level headed person and let them rant and I calmly assed them to leave. They called 911 and screaming that some creepy old perv was harassing them. 

After a few minutes the police show up. Two female police. One goes and talks to the girls, the other talks to me. I explain to here that I live here and it is my job as caretaker to keep people from trespassing on the property. All the while the girls are getting all emotional with the other officer using words like creepy, they felt threatened, rape, the whole 9 yards. The 2 officers talk alone, then come over and cuff me risk me, take my wallet, phone, and keys, then seat me in the back of my car while they check my background and a warren search. All the while the two sunbathing girls are all giddy about me being in cuffs and taking my pic and text/posting like crazy. 

After about 15 minutes they take me out of the car and cuffs, and tell me I am free to go. (Go where? I fucking live here!) They then ask the girls, who are pissed that I was uncuffed, if they wanted to file a report against me, but they would have to leave the property. 

So for doing my job, on private property where I live, I end up in handcuffs for being considered ""creepy"" by doing my job. 

The officers never asked me if I wanted to file charges against them for trespassing.....of course. 

Update #1: I woke up this morning and my just venting on here blew up. I've replied to a few comments. I spoke to the board members of the club and we agree that in the future I should just call the non emergency number for the police and to record it. I also contacted a member who is a retired from the state supreme court and she told me ""that is utter bullshit"" as to how I was detained and she is putting a call into the police chief. I appreciate all the support, thank you!

Update #2: I recieved a phone call from the police departments internal affairs division today, they took a statement from me and are going to look into how the officers handled the call. I should hear something in a few weeks. I got the names of of the two girls who were tresspassing. So far I have not found any pics of me cuffed in the back of the car. 
  

Update #3, It has been over a month since I filed my complaint over be handcuffed, detained, questioned, and background checked. So this afternoon was low at work and I called the CPD internal affairs division to find out the status of my complaint against the officers. Well over 45 minutes being put on, on and off hold, I was told that there is no record of the report. I have the report number and they can't seem to find it.

is a very proud feminist. I am the only male in the class. This is a small college so she is teaching the entire program. The man bashing was getting out of hand and I had enough. So I wrote her this email regarding some of my issues in the class:

Hello R\*\*\*,

I am not happy in your classes. I feel that it is the duty of the instructor to present the material as unbiased as possible, and as a proud feminist you do not do that. These issues are not new, I have been feeling this way for a long time. However, it was on Wednesday of last week that I reached my breaking point. In my twenties I may have identified as a feminist, but I’ve grown since. I do not support the feminist ideology. I believe in equal rights, but “woke feminism” is a joke at best, and very dangerous at its worst. I realize that you are very passionate about your feminist beliefs, but I am not, and I do not want to hear it in the classroom any longer. I have requested several times to transfer to another class however B\*\*\*\*\*n is not responding to my emails. I can no longer sit quietly on this. Until they can find another class for me to join, I will be joining your lectures, but I will do minimal participation. I will not answer questions, and my camera will be off. Topics such as mansplaining, manspreading and the pay gap are non-issues. Mansplaining is a feminist tactic to silence men, manspreading is due to biology, the pay gap is due to the difference choices that men and women make. To pay someone differently for the same job with the same qualifications is illegal and every time they look for it in the West, they repeatedly find men as the underpaid gender, if it exists at all. Just look at what happened with women’s soccer in the US and the BBC in the UK. There is no Patriarchy, just a hierarchy based upon competence, with the most competent rising to the top. And that is just the tip of the iceberg.

Feminism is an ideology based upon victimhood and I will not be a part of that belief system.

It is because I like and respect you that I am writing this email. If it was not for that, I would not have returned.

One last point, men make up 95% of war casualties. The ones that do survive are traumatized, disfigured and never the same. To say that women and children are the biggest victims of war, was deeply offensive. If one considers all people as equals and you can still regard women and children as the biggest victims of war, something is very wrong with your reasoning. Most of those men that died; died protecting our borders so we can be safe and enjoy our lives in peace. Do not discredit their sacrifices. None of them wanted to die, but that was the cost of our freedom.

Sincerely,

88888 8888888

My professor's reply was sent through Bongo. Our classes are all online. I didn't realize that Bongo does not automatically save private messages.

I actually have a good relationship with the professor. I do have the support of all the students in the classroom. The day of the incident where she was particularly man bashing I commented that there was ""too much man hating going on"". The rest of the class either apologized or came to my defense. I really like my classmates. I then went completely silent for the rest of the week and did not join her class.

418,tcyo1p,2022-03-13,MensRights,"Australian report by feminist organisation claims support for men's rights is a ""significant barrier to gender equality""","This report summarises a survey of Australians with regards to attitudes towards gender equality and was conducted by a feminist organisation which is, as they all are, solely focused on things like getting more female CEOs and more women elected to political office.

There is some good news in the report and the feminists must have burned in anger at having to write it. For example:

>**Men have been forgotten in the struggle for gender equality**  
>  
>Our survey reveals a worrying statistic in this regard: nearly half of all male respondents “agreed or strongly agreed” with the statement that “gender equality strategies in the workplace do not take men into account”. If we disaggregate the data by generation, we find that while millennial and builder males were most likely to report feelings of being left out, all generations exhibited similar sentiments. Millennial males were also significantly more likely (48 per cent) to “agree/strongly agree” with the statement that “Men and boys are increasingly excluded from measures to improve gender equality”, followed by Gen Z males at 44 per cent. Gender equality measures are not the only interventions that are perceived by men to deepen, rather than fix existing inequalities. The highly contested concept of freedom of speech also reveals significant gendered differences, with men far more likely to say that political correctness benefits women in the workplace.

This section is surprisingly revealing of feminist motivations. I'm surprised they would include this in a public report:

>**Male moderates are champions of men’s rights**  
>  
>The moderate perspective combines an egalitarian set of views around gender equality in the workplace and at home with rising concern over what they understand as the growing impact of political correctness in Australian society, as well as a strong desire to see men’s rights equally represented in public discussion of equality issues. Given that 62 per cent of Australians align with the moderate position and its value system, this represents a significant barrier to gender equality.

Got that?

Feminists think that concerns for men's rights and a desire to see men treated equally to women are an obstacle to feminists achieving the goals that they dishonestly label ""equality"".

Other stats cited include:

* 41% of Australian men believe that political correctness gives women an advantage in the workplace
* 46% of Australian men believe that gender equality measures do not take men into account
* 42% of Australian men believe that men and boys are increasingly excluded from measures to improve gender equality

The feminist authors fear that these popular and growing attitudes could result in a ""backlash"" against feminist initiatives and ""backsliding"" away from the goals which they're pursuing.

Of course, any time that feminists are unhappy or even hysterical it is good news for men and for progress towards true equality. I see this report as quite positive.

They gave me some other bullshit reason for firing me but I was the most qualified person in the group - even more qualified than the female managers. 

The case took a turn for the worse because they opened a court case against me. Unfortunately our country is now run by a socialist government and elections will only be held in March. 

The main problem in issues such as mine is that WHOLE HR departments are populated by women. There is NOT A SINGLE MAN. I started seeing a therapist - a very nice lady - who understands very well the dynamics inside such workplaces. I chose a woman because I really do not care whether it is a man or a woman who helps me as I am not sexist. This therapist saw what was happening and is ready to help me fight a court case against the people who fired me.  I am amazed at how clearly she sees through the work place politics against men.

I work in sales and spent the majority of yesterday walking through 10 floors of a large company for an assessment. By the end of the day, my feet felt uncomfortable, but I didn’t think much of it. Fast forward to today - as I was taking my shoes off to put them on the shoe rack, I noticed the ones I wore yesterday.

This stopped me in my tracks. Working in a male-dominated industry, I've felt pressure to conform to certain beauty standards, often at the expense of my own physical well-being. The walkthrough took 3 hours, accompanied by two men. There were moments when I walked in front of them, particularly while climbing flights of stairs, and it's hard to believe this went unnoticed. Where's the humanity?

More than that, I've often been put in situations where I've been expected to endure whatever bullshit I'm facing, not just at work but in life as a whole.

I don’t know. There's a deeper commentary here beyond 'beauty standards are dumb'. Seeing my shoes in this condition made my heart hurt.",coldbrewcult,t2_pr51b7xm,0.9,2809,235
463,1ajawvq,2024-02-05,Feminism,"Yes, we do.","Let’s review my list:

1.) Almost immediately after a car accident one morning, I had to Uber the rest of my way to work. I was already a little shaken up, but once we got to the office, the driver kept demanding my phone number and became increasingly hostile the more I would tell him “no”. 

2.) I took a commission-based sales job but only lasted one week. The reason? There were actually two. The first one being a guy getting in my face and attempting to grab the company tablet I had in my hands. He just laughed when he noticed I was scared. The other reason was because another guy had kept trying to touch me inappropriately. These two incidents were on the same day. I went back to the main office and resigned after the second one. Fun fact about this one, my significant other at the time actually got angry with me for quitting this job and we ended up getting into an argument. 

3.) A guy, presumably in his 50’s-60’s, accosted my friends and I in a mall parking lot, making explicit remarks towards us. We were only in middle school. 

I’m sure there are other stories I could share, or that have been completely removed from my memory.

While I won’t deny that in most romance books/movies that’s true, I can’t help but laugh at how upset that made the guy who answered. Like do you not realize the reason women fantasize about that is because in real life they do 90% of the work it takes to maintain a relationship? Married women everywhere dream of men who take charge and make them feel loved because in real life they spend all day caring for their husbands and families. It’s not a popular genre among women because it represents real life, it’s because its a complete inversion of the way most heterosexual romances work.

479,y6g1ab,2022-10-17,Feminism,The Amouranth situation should change people's mind about sex work,"Throwaway because I have coworkers on my other account and I don't want this controversial opinion known in my work place.

&#x200B;

Let me preface this post by saying this : I believe that sex work is work, I believe that sex work should be decriminalized  because that is the only way to provide a safe environment for the sex workers, an environment in which they feel safe to report assault. However, I believe that sex work, like any other type of work under capitalism, is exploitative. But, there is an added layer of misogyny thrown in the middle. Most sex workers are women, most sollicitors are men, most pimps are men, and I don't think you can analyze this phenomenon outside of the patriarchal lens. Therefore, I can not, in good faith, repeat the slogan ""sex work is empowering"", I believe the vast majority of sex workers are abused, and I abhore the liberal feminist way of glamorizing sex work, especially to impressionable young teens.

&#x200B;

If you don't know who Amouranth is, she is one of the top twitch streamers and if i'm not mistaken, one of the earliest to start the Hot Tub streams. She also has an OF and has been making over a million dollars a month on both of these platforms. She is what many would refer to as an independent sex worker, she's not working with a porno production company, she is her own boss and has people working FOR her. Yesterday, she went live on twitch and revealead live and with proof, that she has been abused by her husband of 7 years, that HE was the one to force her to become The Amouranth that we all know today. She was even forced to keep their marriage a secret because it would ""damage the brand"" according to him, it was kept so secretive that not even people who have met her and streamed with her multiple times knew about it. Basically, she had been trafficked this whole time, while being used as an example of someone who willingly performs sex work, being evidence that sex work can be empowering.

&#x200B;

This situation was the final nail in the coffin for me, I have kept the possibility that a few sex workers may be doing this with no brainwashing and no coercion, but after everything that came out, I can not, in good faith, entertain this possibility. Amouranth had a documentary done on her in which she stated she was happy with what she was doing out of her own volition, so I can not help but wonder how many other sex workers who do it out of their own volition are lying about it. 

&#x200B;

Now, this isn't to say that we shouldn't believe them, or stop them from doing it, I am not even blaiming Amouranth for lying about this, and I absolutely unequivocally stand with her, she is a victim of abuse and deserves all the support she can get. My argument is about the bigger picture, feminists can not continue to defend sex work as a respectable arena for women, it is abusive, dehumanizing, and dangerous. Here, we had the case of a woman who seemed to be doing it all on her own, coupled with the statements of several former sex workers, the glamorization of places such as OF needs to end. We need an honest discussion around the topic, I understand that many believe that if we state how exploitative sex work can be, we're going to be contributing to the stigma and therefore danger that sex workers face, but I believe there is a way to stand up for sex workers, without dragging more gullible young victims into this dangerous job.",Ok-Target-349,t2_tfyd4f1h,0.94,874,164

517,18wnt0m,2024-01-02,Feminism,"Not all men, but all women","(I don't know how well I'm going to get my point across but I'll try) Every feminist discussion regarding male violence against women and girls is flooded with variations of this sentiment. The main fear of the ""not all men"" demographic is that every man would be punished for the deeds of a few, right? Some of them even assert that they are already being punished. That they are afraid to talk to women or work with them. 

But women have always been punished for the violence that men enact against us. Collectively. Here are two events that have happened in the past month:

[A state in India proposed to ban late-evening coaching classes. The ban applied specifically to female students](https://scroll.in/latest/1059678/wrong-at-many-levels-social-media-users-decry-up-ban-on-late-evening-coaching-for-women) It was revoked after criticism, thankfully. 

[Taliban puts abused women in jail to ""protect"" them](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67724424)

These are particularly egregious examples but how removed is this mindset from the rest of the world? These legal measures are directed specifically at women when it was far more logical to apply them to men.

When ""metoo"" gained popularity:  
- 21% of men said they would be reluctant to hire women for a job that would require close interaction (such as business travel)  
and  
- 19% of men said they would be reluctant to hire an attractive woman.  
[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/29/men-women-workplace-study-harassment-harvard-metoo) (BTW: Taking this into account, doesn't ""we are afraid to talk to women or work with them"" come off as a threat?)

Once we realised that women face sexual harassment and abuse, the response was to punish *them*. To restrict their careers.

I know I'm not saying anything new. Imagine curfews aimed only at men (or stricter for men). Men being slut shamed for drinking, partying with the opposite gender or for the way they dress. Imagine a country where men are the ones who are not allowed to work outside the home or go out without a female chaperone. But it's the other way around. Rules are always made for women to ""protect"" them. Every woman's career, social life and freedom in general is compromised. 

**Women are collectively punished for the deeds of men.** No law specifically targets men, like in the two articles I've shared above. No institutes are openly threatening to not hire men in response to a social movement.

So do the notallmen men think this is fair? Are they speaking out against this? Notallwomen too, right?",identitty_theft,t2_5lzmdyue,0.96,734,100
549,13iehvi,2023-05-15,Feminism,"My coworker, who recently was involved in hiring a young woman, casually said to me ""I told them not to hire her, I wanted a man. Less drama.""","This is an example of blatant sexism and discrimination. Right?! 

She, in writing, advised they not hire this woman. She made up official reasons, but in person she said the above to me.

She didn't want to hire her based solely on the fact that she was a woman.... Not because there was a better male candidate, or any better candidate. She literally said she wanted them to hire a man, any man, instead of this woman because women are too much drama and men don't have feelings. 

Please can someone confirm I'm not crazy - this is, in fact, blatant discrimination in the hiring process and blatant sexism? Right?

Luckily upper management was impressed with this young woman who was discriminated against and she got the job, despite this other woman actively discouraging them from doing so. But no matter what, the fact that she discriminated against her and that she also was so brazen as to admit that behavior casually to me (also a woman!) is disgusting.

For my part,  I told her it was discrimination, it was wrong to do that, men DO have feelings (but often feel afraid to express them bc of people like her), and women are all different and multifaceted people and cannot be lumped into one category of being ""too much drama"" and that's a hurtful and false characterization of women. 

She acted like I was being over dramatic. And I am very passionate about equal rights for women so please tell me - what do you think? Is this workplace discrimination?

Edit: thank you all for validating me on this. I can't respond to everyone but I appreciate all the input and thoughts. I'm going to see what I can do to escalate this so it doesn't happen again. The next woman might not be so lucky.

602,1ajt193,2024-02-05,Feminism,Unpopular Opinion: Women (at least for a few years) NEED to be alone,"I was reading ""A room of one's own"" by Virginia Woolf where she basically argues that women need money and independence to write. It got me thinking about something that could be somewhat controversial which is that in order for a woman to meet her full potential she NEEDS TO BE ALONE. Like she needs to live alone. I'm not saying away from her parents, no man. I'm saying no roommates or anything. I feel like society grooms women to feel dependent on other people and counter intuitive.

When you're in a relationship you're going to be affected by that person. You literally can't help it, you are affected deeply by the people around you and your environment. I think women really need to figure shit out by themselves. We also unconsciously seek validation from those around us because again, in the passed we were told that our value and success is based on getting validation from those around us. And specifically in the workplace, while men are simply validated based on their work performance, women are forced to seek validation in their demeanor, the way they act, the way they talk, the way they dress, to be respected.

I know some of you might disagree but literally think about it for a second. At any time in your life when you were around other people do you not think that you could've thrived in a setting that was completely controlled and managed by yourself?

Also to add: This is coming from a woman with a middle eastern cultural background, and what fuels this argument for me is the fact that in the Middle East, its not culturally accepted for a woman to be alone. They live with their parents until marriage and then move in with their husbands. Subsequently, women in the Middle East are pushed into societal expectations of being a housewife. They are typically not pushed into career excellence but rather they are taught to be a good housewife and mother. I see a strong correlation with the lack of physical independence and the societal expectation for eastern women to be dependent on men for their entire lives.

Update: more thoughts- I think taking a year or two to live in your own space, be secure in yourself and figuring out exactly what you like and don't like without the influence of others and just learning to be completely fine by yourself it will completely change your outlook on life. **With all these romantic comedies and romance novels and the fucking love songs 24/7 getting popularized, women (as I've seen on social media) have started feeling incomplete without a relationship and it's pushed us into this feeling of loneliness and a never ending quest for love. But when you live alone until you find that perfect sense of contentment and stoicism, when you think it's time to go on and start looking for a relationship, you will not lower or sacrifice a single fucking standard because you'll KNOW a relationship isn't the center of your life and men aren't the center of the world. You'll start seeing relationships and dating like men do, which are commodities. They're nice to have around, they make life easier, but they aren't a necessity by any means. That's how men see us. The only thing they feel like they need from women is sexual gratification. So they're in zero rush to find someone and they will fuck everyone and their mom over without skipping the beat. And they're confused when we ""care too much"" about things that they don't think matter.  When in truth, society has pushed this narrative on us so severely that our lives are empty and bland if we're single and not exploring anything.**

*Update: I'm going to address the financial side of this since a lot of people were concerned. Of course I know that it's a financial strain to have to live alone and it's just not possible for many people. My argument is that* ***If*** *you have the option between living with others or comfortably living alone, to choose the latter. And people have commented saying that while working 3 jobs they were happier and more comfortable living alone than when they moved in with other people. I agree. Before starting a family I would work 4 jobs if it meant financial independence and the chance to see that I'm an individual as opposed to someone's daughter or someone's future wife and mom. It is so so so important to get to know yourself in that way. Also I feel like the counter arguments don't understand that you're trading some comforts, financial wiggle room to buy more shit, travel, etc. for your own comfort at home. If you financially rely on other people there is this weird imbalance where you feel the need to compensate emotionally and it's just exhausting. Fuck that. Take at least a few years, in your 20s before you get married where you're not in a relationship and you live life on your own terms. If you're living on your own terms you don't need to spend time and energy pleasing others, which is what we're taught is all we have. Instead we can redirect that time and energy into self improvement- thriving-meeting our full potential.*

660,y4f5iy,2022-10-15,Feminism,Now not even the gym is safe,"I workout at my local Y pretty much 5 days a week. I wear leggings and a pump cover and a sports bra. I look cute and it makes me feel confident in my workout not to mention it helps me cool down to take off the pump cover because I really go hard during my workouts. 

I have noticed stares from men but I ignore them and just mind my business. Sometimes they just want the equipment you’re on. Tonight as I was momentarily sitting in my car before heading home from the gym, a man (one i actually thought had been ogling me) waved me down from his car that was parked right beside me. 

I rolled down my window and said, “everything good?” I felt I already knew what was coming and I wasn’t looking forward to it. He said, “Hey I just wanted to let you know that there’s guys following you around in the gym and talking about you. Guy stuff. They even ran to the window to look out as you left to see what car was yours” 

I was instantly appalled, that was not what I was expecting him to say, I asked what they looked like and he gave me what they were wearing but I don’t pay too much attention to others in the gym and definitely don’t have a photographic memory so I had no idea who he could be describing. I thanked him for the info and then it came, 

“Do you go straight home after this?” I felt like maybe he was the creep and responded no, that I don’t go straight home… and then he asked me “Do you want to go two-steppin?” I said no, that I’ve got a boyfriend. Which is true. 

So let me get this straight. You’re going to scare the shit out of me by telling me this concerning information and then ask me out? I can’t stop thinking about this interaction. Even though I did not go straight home I’m scared of being assaulted by someone who would follow me home from the gym.

I feel I can’t go to the gym at night anymore. I’m really frustrated and frightened by this encounter. I’m mad because I should be safe regardless of leggings or time of day. I’m mad because I want to be comfortable when I workout and that will be used against me. I bought pepper spray and won’t be going at night anymore without my friend.

Edit: Thank you everyone who is sharing support. It means a lot.

UPDATE: I just went to my gym and this man has been reported by multiple staff and members for his creepy and predatory behavior. I filled out an incident report, the very girl who helped me had been approached by him before after work in the parking lot. She said she’s really gonna push for something to be done.
