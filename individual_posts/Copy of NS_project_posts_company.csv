I myself am a younger woman in my youth (no need to specify how old) and decided to have an enjoyable day at the lake with my friends because it was hot outside. We got in our bathing suits and sunbathed, the thing is right by the lake is a road. Just to be clear me and my friends are all minors. So as we are tanning a car drives by slowly and looks at us while driving, that’s not a crime right just a little suspicious, but then the car driver back around and cat calls us. Then he comes back around and tells us explicit things and tells us to undress. Luckily we got a good look at the truck and he had his business on the car. We told everyone in the neighborhood. This man was middle aged and targeting minors by themselves. His mom then had the audacity to say that we were asking for it and that we were luring him and being promiscuous. A week later he was sent to jail for unrelated reasons, he is now back in the neighborhood and still gets work. I don’t see why a predator gets to keep his job and still be looked at normal while me and my friends are judged for relaxing on a hot day. What are ur thoughts.

231,18jvjvj,2023-12-16,teenagers,How can a woman stay safe when walking alone?,"Going for a walk, bike ride, or run outside should be a time to enjoy the outdoors and your workout routine. But when you're alone, you may look like an easier target. Here are some tips to keep you safe and confident when you're heading outside by yourself.

1. Stick to well populated, busy areas. Avoid hidden trails, short cuts through secluded areas or lanes that are not well travelled. Stay where there is traffic and other people on foot.
2. Stay in well-lit areas. Avoid dark parking lots, dark alleys, dark lanes, dark trails, or dark anything. A well-lit path in a well-populated area is your safest route to any destination, even if it takes a bit longer.
3. If you are out at night, wear reflective clothing so drivers can see you.
4. Important: Do not shut yourself off from the rest of the world. Headphones cut you off from your surroundings and make it very easy for an attacker to sneak up on you.
5. Take a cell phone. Carry a cell phone to have handy for 911 and other minor emergencies. Do not be distracted by making and taking calls, text, or social media posts. It is okay to call someone before you leave and talk with him or her to give him or her the play-by-play until you are safe. This ensures you have someone “with” you if something happens who knows where you are.
6. Let others know. Always leave notice of where you are going and when you are expected to return with a household member or friend who can check on you.
7. Keep your head up and look confident. Your posture can make all the difference in how you are perceived by a potential attacker. If you are looking down, seem distracted or look afraid you are more likely to become a target.
8. Almost home? Have keys ready in your hands and inside your pocket. When you reach your door, you should have had your keys ready in the proper position in your hands. This will avoid a situation where you are scrambling around in your bag. When this happens, you are at risk of being distracted.

* Safety tips: We provide [safety-keychain tools](https://shopepy.com/bannerNewCategory?id=1704174460334227456&name=Defense%20Keychain%20One&type=2) on how to stay safe in a variety of situations, from walking home alone at night to traveling abroad.

1. Avoid struggling with lots of bags. Struggling with five different bags at night as you make your way into the house can be a fact of life, but you should avoid it whenever possible. Multiple bags can prevent your ability to react quickly should a dangerous situation arise.
2. If you think you are being followed, head into an open store, restaurant or lighted home if you cannot make it to a police station.
3. Act on your gut feelings. If someone gives you a bad feeling, tell him or her clearly to leave you alone, and walk away.
4. If someone asks you for the time, keep your eyes up as you check your watch.
5. Give directions from a distance. Do not approach a car that has stopped to ask you directions.
6. Yell if you are under attack. Keep yelling, repeatedly. Yell as loud as you can. Scream. Be noisy. This alone may spook off the attacker.
7. Know what to do in the worst-case scenario. A best defense against an attack is awareness and action. If you are faced with an uncomfortable or dangerous situation and you can escape, do so immediately. Only you can determine what you can or will do when faced with an attacker.",CindyBlair95,t2_qwol0tcj,1.0,1,5

237,qbgmts,2021-10-19,teenagers,Woman dont belong in combat: change my mind.,"Not me its a quote""As the Army’s first female infantry officer, I have long awaited the elimination of a gender-based fitness test. The drastically lower female standards of the old Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) not only jeopardized mission readiness in combat units but also reinforced the false notion that women are categorically incapable of performing the same job as men. The new Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) promised to alleviate these issues by finally assessing women on the same fitness scale as men and setting minimum physical standards based on branch requirements rather than gender.
However, these gender-neutral standards have recently garnered criticism. Due to an initial ACFT fail rate of 54 percent among women, activist groups have raised concerns that the test will disadvantage female servicemembers. As such, lawmakers directed the Army to halt implementation of the ACFT until the service can prove it will not negatively impact the recruitment and retention of soldiers in critical support jobs, particularly those with large female populations. To address this concern, the Army is considering reverting to gender-based fitness scoring for promotion and reducing the minimum standards for combat arms. Based on my experience, I feel compelled to share how this potential reversal in policy will negatively impact both combat arms branches and the women who serve in them.
First, reverting to gender-based scoring could drastically reduce the performance and effectiveness of combat arms units. Specifically, without a separate, minimum standard for combat arms, the requirements to join the nation’s combat forces could soon be as low as performing ten push-ups in two minutes, running two miles in twenty-one minutes, deadlifting 140 pounds three times, and performing only one repetition of a leg tuck or, failing that, two minutes of a plank exercise.

For me, you can agree the riots and also not like the looting. Looting small Businesses is wrong, and should be retaliated against with rooftop Koreans, however I think large stores deserve to be broken, looted, as they support the systematic oppression of black, poor,  and marginalised peoples.

Like if I'm asking if a friend has seen someone, and I describe him by saying ""A tall black guy, wearing a blue hoodie,"" etc, I'm not being racist, I'm merely describing their looks. If I say something about the colors white and black, I am not a fucking racist, I am merely saying colors.

2, I don't care if you are gay, or lesbian, or bisexual, or whatever. You are still a human and I respect you. Just don't make 'gay' your personality, it's not an attractive thing imo.

3, No, I am not being sexist if I say ""Oh I didn't think that was a girl."" All I am saying is I'm surprised that it was a girl. Like for instance when I found out that Timmy Turner was voiced by a woman, I was suprised because I thought it was a little boy voicing him, not because I thought women couldn't be in the filming industry.

4, I do not care what your body type is. Large, skinny, tall, short, etc. But I have my preferences. I'm not body shaming if I don't want to date a larger woman, that's just not my preference. It's not what I find attractive.

5, idk how this is in people's heads, but I'll say it anyway. NO, I'M NOT HOMOPHOPIC IF I DONTWANT TO DATE A GUY! I am not gay, I do not find men attractive! Idc if you are that way orientated, never have. But I do not care to date a guy. I prefer the company of women.

The work itself isn't very hard, though it can be physically demanding, which I don't mind too much and I got quite a fee hours for part-time, which is great because it's what I was looking for.

Now my problem is with the supervisors. Most of them aren't so great, always expecting me to just know stuff when apart from some volunteer work, this is my first time doing a job of this sort. One supervisor in particular, is probably the most awful woman I've ever met. She yells at everyone and gets irritated when I ask her to clarify what she's saying because she's terrible at explaining things. 

Today was my 2nd week of work and this woman absolutely blew up on me because wasn't doing my job exactly how she wanted, even though it really didn't effect much of anything. No cuss words or anything of that sort were used that would get her in trouble. She made me do an even more strenuous task as a form of punishment and apologized at the very end likely so I wouldn't complain about her behavior most likely.

Now I'm wondering if maybe I should resign? Her behavior is awful and according to my coworkers, it barely gets any better.

Right.So to start this off I (19M) am not an incel.

So I was hanging out with my cousin Vinny (18M) the other day when he told me ""mate if ya stay home all day on your Xbox going on Elden ring or whatever you will never get yoself a women.Go take a break from reddit and have a shower.""
This statement baffled me.
Firstly it is acshually a PC not a an Xbox (because im not some loser lol). And secondly I do not need to take a break from reddit AGAIN since I already vary my activities greatly.For example I have recently taken up moderating twelve discord servers at the same time and also tweet nineteen times a day.
But the really disturbing part was his last words.
He told me to take a ""shower"" (i am not entirely sure i believe in those either) and that I will never get a women.

What is this object he refers to as ""woman""?

I began scouring the internet and after much research I discovered that woman were those long haired versions of males you see out on the streets.Apparently 50% of the population is them.
This is the part that made me skeptical. If woman make up 50% of the population then how come none of them ever speak to me or touch me??!!!Coincidence? I think not.

Isn't it strange how the same people you see talking about ""women"" as you do discussing ""touching grass"" and ""going outside"".
I believe that Females are a conspiracy theory started by liberals being pulled of by holograms trying to persuade gamers like me to go outside, touch this so called ""grass"" and use these sketchy devices called ""showers"".

Females are not real. The only thing close to them are femboys.Otherwise,women are not real.
Us gamers must stick together and rise up against these conspiracies trying to stop us.

I hate it. It makes me feel weird in my own body. I feel like I have to cover up.  It genuinely creates so much anxiety.

It’s really weird because usually women are much more sexually and mentally mature than men in these scenarios, and it’s so weird that we’ve taken a step back here.

268,4bxrmv,2016-03-25,teenagers,"[Serious] I got into a car accident today, about 2 hours ago.","To start off with, I am okay. I am still very shaken and I was afraid to get back into my car as a driver, and I still am afraid. It went worse than I thought a car accident should have, and with talking to my parents (who were on the scene after it all happened), it was not how the other party should have reacted.

So, I was leaving the business my parents own, and I was about to pull out. I checked all of my mirrors and my blindspot and saw nothing, so I thought I was okay to pull out. I wasn't. I ended up side swiping a car that somehow must've been behind me, and then my car was pushed into a parked car, swiping that one was well. 

When this happened, the car that was moving that I initially hit, drive forward, stopped, and the man in the passenger side stepped out and started to shout at me, calling me rude names and using insane amounts of profanity. I was in the process of pulling over at this time, so once I did, I put on my flashers and stopped my car. I got out, was being yelled at, when the woman on the drivers side came out and started to shout at me as well, asking me, ""who the fuck taught you how to drive? Don't you know how to check your fucking blindspot?""

At this point I'm crying, bawling my eyes out, shaking and just panicking. I tell the woman that I checked my blindspot and that I think that she should call the cops because I need to call my parents who was across the street in the store. She keeps on yelling at me when the man from the passenger side chimes in, ""You better consider yourself lucky that you're not the other fuckin gender. If you were the other gender, you'd be in a worse fuckin situation with your face pounded in"". At this point I tell the woman that she NEEDS to call the cops. She finally does, I call my mom, and my mom comes right across the street to help me out because of how threatened I felt in this situation.

The woman is still yelling at me, and my mom just straight up tells her, ""My daughter is 17 years old. She does not deserve to be shouted at in this situation. I do not know what makes you feel as though you can yell at her. This is her first accident, and obviously she's really sorry about what happened, and she's obviously traumatized."" The woman continues to try to speak to me when my mom just flat out says, ""You are not allowed to speak to my daughter at any point further. The cop has just arrived and you need to speak to him."" At this point, while my mom is saying all of this, the man tries to apologize, and my mom won't take it at all. 

The cop comes up to me and talks to me just a little bit, realizes that I need to calm down and decides to talk to the driver of the other car. During this time, the man that was the passenger leaves the entire scene to ""go to the bank"". The woman tells her side of the story, then he comes to talk to my mom and asks if any other cars were involved. She takes him to the parked car and she shows him that. At this time, the woman comes up to me, snickers, and says, ""you hit another car too?"". I nod my head and she laughs, then walks back away.

I was lucky enough to have some bystanders, and they told the officer that the man was yelling at me and causing more of a commotion than need be. The only downside was that they couldn't make out everything that he was shouting at me about. 

The cop comes back over to me at this point, tells me that the woman will get tased if she comes near me again. 

Anyways, the situation didn't end well, really. My insurance company called and said that the woman's story is different than mine and all of this other stuff. They now have to wait for the police report.

I'm afraid to get back into my car again. I couldn't drive myself home and I had a panic attack getting into the passenger side of the car.

I used my massive galaxy brain to create a genius master plan only to COMPLETELY NEGLECT TO CONSIDER WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO WITH THE RESULT LONG-TERM.

It all started a few months ago when I decided to create a portrait of one of my own original characters. I spent ages trying out a detailed, painterly style, different from what I usually did. This was my *first* mistake.
See, when I was finished, I had no clue what to do with the background. The style was much too detailed to warrant a single block color, but the pose was so basic that pairing it with any scenic background would just look awkward. After trying and failing to figure out what to do with the thing, I made my *second* mistake.

**I exported it as a transparent PNG and gave it to my friends.**

You know exactly how this went. I don't even need to tell you, but just for fun;

- Picture of my friend's face

- Vsauce Michael shirtless in front of a brick wall

- ""Kurger Bing""

- You know I had to do it to em'

- Emerging from my friend's closet

- Fucking LOSS

- ""Here's Johnny"" scene from The Shining

- Scene from It where pennywise lures a kid into a drain

- Shockingly well-made edit where she's in Space Jam

It should have ended there. That should have been the end of it. But no. No no no no no no. I just so happened to attend a public vocational school. A public vocational school with lots of useful resources for doing a variety of useful things. Of course, I decide to use these resources for the most useless thing in existence, namely, the GIANT FUCKING PRINTER.
Of course. Of course I ended up here. This was the obvious conclusion of the joke. Instead of merely editing her onto still image backgrounds, I'd use *reality itself* as her background. So, with absolutely NO CONSIDERATION for what I planned to DO with the thing, I began printing a **life-size cardboard cutout of the character.**
I don't even want to *know* how much taxpayer money this wasted. All the overpriced printer ink that contributed to this nightmare. The character being dark-skinned definitely didn't help.

So, there she stood. Guardian of our classroom. Staring into our souls, 24/7. That cheeky wink of hers will be *burned* into my *brain* for the rest of time. At some point we just turned her backwards so she would be staring at the wall instead of us. Unfortunately, turns out I'm so good at character design that her silhouette was *stupidly* recognizable even when she was a solid block of paper-bag-brown, making her almost as terrifying as usual. We started using her to prank the other kids. Our class was right by one of the main exits of the school, so we positioned her to stare out the window as everyone left. We also found that this was an effective way to dissuade robbers.

But it couldn't last forever. Of *course* it couldn't last forever. Despite the fact that in our next year, we'd be in the same class with the same teacher, our room was getting a renovation. So of course, we had to move everything out. Including my monstrosity.

So, on that fateful final day of school, I had to awkwardly carry her out to my car through a busy parking lot. It was barely windy, but for some reason she still acted as a giant fucking sail. I nearly went flying across the parking lot trying to inconspicuously carry her. When I actually got to the car, we had to put the back seat down just-finished-buying-some-really-long-boards-of-wood-from-the-home-depot style because she was too large to fit any other way.

I think at one point before then, I actually *did* consider where I'd put her after I took her home for the summer. I simply thought, ""Oh, I'll just put her in my closet"" without ever stopping to OPEN THE FUCKING CLOSET and *SEE HOW MUCH SPACE WAS IN IT.*

I bring her home. I carry her up to my room. I open my closet. **SHE DOESN'T FIT.**

Oh my god. I'm so fucking stupid. She doesn't fit in my closet,  because the wooden shelf is lower than she is tall. Where the hell else am I supposed to put her? Am I supposed to just... leave her in my room? I live with my parents, I can't just put her around the house. All my friends tell me to tape her to the ceiling. Literally the ONLY place to put her is my bedroom. Because of COURSE it fucking is. FML. 

From then on, every night, I have slept with her staring at me. Always silently watching, winking-but-unblinking. My personal guardian nightmare. A sleep paralysis demon of my own making. Because of a joke that went too far.

298,siw1sm,2022-02-02,teenagers,"Make assumptions about me based on ""walls of text"" I've written in the past month","""How not to talk about trans people""

 So obviously, as stupid as it is, people still argue about trans people, all the time. Often I've come to notice incoherence or just poor argument, even from the side of education, and I don't like that, so here we are.

So one thing, the line ""if it makes them happier, just call them what they want to be called"", it seems good at first, but it can trigger an immediate refute if they're any smarter than ben shapiro, the attack helicopter joke immediately becomes actually usable, when talking about gender that argument makes no sense, but if all you say is ""if it makes them happier"" then it becomes an actual argument, this is why you have to specify that you're referring to one's gender specifically, and explain how gender is different from, say, being an attack helicopter.

Another thing you have to be aware of, often people will just say something straight up not related to what you said, and you have to be careful of this to make clear that they're not responding. For example, ben shapiro (who I intend to use for every example), when he's confronted about trans people, will often completely ignore what he was asked, and instead reply with something like ""well obviously if the person is a consenting adult they can do what they want with their body, but I don't think that children should be getting permanent treatment for gender confusion because kids can't consent, the left wants 4 year olds being taken away from their parents because they won't give a 4 year old boy surgery to make him a girl"", which not only isn't how anything works, but he also is now talking about something entirely different, but his crowd still thinks he just owned you.

And yet another, they will often debate by stating things and hoping you believe they're true without any argument as to why they should be, like when benny boy says ""gender is determined by your chromosomes in biology"" despite 'gender' not being a word that's used in biological terms, but they never say why they think that, they just hope people agree with it with no logic.

They'll also state things that ARE true and act like you disagree, like when ben starts saying ""you can't change your chromosomes"" or ""sexual dimorphism is essential to human reproduction"", these are both true statements, but the thing is, nobody disagrees, he simply hopes people will think you disagree without ever listening to what you have to say, they'll say ""you can't change chromosomes"" but you never said you can, you said chromosomes don't determine your gender.

And in the same manor, they'll often say things that only make logical coherence if you believe something else to be true, without ever giving a reason why that's true, like, with bencil sharpenro again, he once used in a video, ""to prove them wrong, just ask for a non-self-referential definition of man and woman"", but he in that video never bothered to explain why the definition can't be self-referential, he just hoped his viewers would be dumb enough to think that that makes sense.

So essentially, you have to be careful of these, you should always be prepared to not refute their point, but go back to the point that you made, because generally their point won't coincide.

When someone says ""it's a biological fact so trying to change it is stupid"", remind them that the terms ""man"", ""woman"", and ""gender"" are all not biological terms, also remind them how often language changes, make sure to remind them that ""girl"" used to be an exclusively gender-neutral term, remind them that language is something that we invented as people, so if it has more utility and the mass agrees, the definition is what it is.

If they say it's delusional, point them to the definition of delusion, ""an idiosyncratic belief or impression that is firmly maintained despite being contradicted by what is generally accepted as reality or rational argument"", and remind them that a trans woman being a woman is generally accepted as true, and all medical consensus agrees, making them definitionally the delusional one.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""Replying to strawman talking points"" 

""A trans woman isn't a woman""

Well, medically and legally speaking, that's factually untrue. Although, definitions are something we create, not something we found in the wild that can be objectively determined, so depending on the definition used, that can technically be true, though I would argue that definition is bad. The purpose of definitions is to serve a social utility, since my definition doesn't lose any utility, and there are still other terms such as AMAB to describe people who were assigned male at birth, we're not losing anything by using the better definition, it has more utility, and it's also been shown EMPIRICALLY to help people and save lives, personally the lives of children are very important in my eyes, so I consider that a good thing.

""It's basic science""

First things first, science isn't a basic subject, I've spent over 200 hours of my life reading scientific studies on trans people, suicidality, and how transphobia effects them, and I still haven't read even close to everything about it. Second thing, no it isn't, that's not how science works, definitions are something we create as people, so there's no ""scientific"" way to prove a definition, literally nobody who even somewhat understands things thinks definitions are objective, and if scientists agree with my definition, doesn't that make my definition the scientific one. Thirdly, this argument usually boils down to the idea that sex is objectively measurable, which it is, sex still isn't an objective definition though, but biological sex as we understand it is an objectively existing thing, but you act as if ""sex is real"" is some sort of point you've made, I know sex is real, I had it with your dad last night, no one's saying sex isn't real, but that doesn't make gender the same as sex, facts don't care about your feelings mate, sorry

""But if being transgender is possible because gender is a social construct, why can't I identify as a different age or weight""

Whilst technically the way we measure weight and age are socially constructed, in that we created the units of time or measurement, the main difference is that gender is considered by medical professionals and by the majority of people to be a matter of identity, whilst they're socially constructed, weight and age can be objectively, empirically measured, gender on the other hand, being a matter of identity, can't be empirically measured, and you may say ""what about dick or vagina"" to which I would once again refer to the fact that gender and sex are different, gender isn't a biological term, so using it that way is incoherent and fails to actually prove anything.

""John Money""

John Money was awful, no one disagrees with that, and the research he did doesn't prove anything about if transgender people are more likely to kill themselves from being misgendered, this isn't an argument, it doesn't even make coherent sense.

""What about trans women outperforming cis women in women's sports""

First thing, not actually an argument, I just think it's funny, I'm gonna say it now no conservative ever cared about women's sports before it became a reason to try (and fail) to justify transphobia. Okay, now onto the actual point, trans women haven't been empirically shown in any way to have a performance advantage over cis women if they have the same testosterone levels. What do you think makes men on average outperform women? Because it's higher testosterone levels, if you weren't sure, that's what it is, so if a trans women has been taking estrogen for long enough that she has the same testosterone levels as a cis women, she should indefinitely be allowed to participate, it's been empirically shown that they don't have an advantage on that account, so why wouldn't they. If you're one of those people who thinks that bone structure or having more testosterone to start gives an advantage, then we can just use puberty blockers more on children who might be trans.

""No, giving puberty blockers to children is basically child abuse, giving that to a 5 year old and making life altering changes is terrible, and what do you mean by 'might be trans'?""

Well you see Pat, the reason puberty blockers are so used is on account of the fact that they're completely reversible, there aren't any ""life altering changes"", the way hormone blockers are administered, is if a kid has been showing signs of dysphoria and gender non-conformity for a few years, and to clarify, what I don't mean when I say that is a little boy tries on a dress once and likes it, or plays with dolls, I mean consistent, perpetual, straight up rejection of the gender roles or gender they've been assigned, but after that the parents might take them to a doctor, the doctor would then likely refer them to a psychiatrist, specializing in gender, then after a long time, months or even years of psychiatry with this child, they might prescribe them hormone blockers if deemed medically necessary, at this point the child would probably be 9 to 11 by the way, not a 5 year old, and then what the puberty blockers do is they don't make it where puberty never happens, and they don't cause life altering changes, they simply delay the child's puberty, usually until around 16 or so years old, at this point the child's brain is more well developed, hormone blockers don't effect brain development, so at this point they're more mentally capable of making a decision, so now if they decide ""yeah no, I think I don't want to live as a girl, I'm a boy"" they take them off the hormone blockers and puberty hits them like a bus, it's a little later than most people's puberty but in the end it's still the exact same thing, now on the other hand if they say ""hecc yeah, I'm a girl, I want to live that way"" then they would take more feminizing hormones like spironolactone and estrogen, and they transition that way, in a way that's much safer and easier than if they hadn't done it, and now they can also play in women's sports without an unfair advantage.

""But it shouldn't be considered 'transphobic' to use a different definition""

Well actually, if you'd bother to read things, transphobia is a dislike or prejudice against people on account of them being trans, if you're willing to refer to a cis woman as the gender she identifies as, but not refer to a trans woman that way, that's inherently prejudice, especially given that it's been factually shown that it hurts trans people to do so. Also, the fact that you don't want it labeled as transphobic would go to imply that you realize the fact that transphobia is a bad thing, so that's cool.

""But isn't it indoctrinating to kids to portray trans people in media""

No, firstly, trans people are real, media reflecting reality isn't ""indoctrinating"" to your kids, trans people are real and so they can be in tv shows, also cis people are in tv shows all the time, isn't that indoctrinating kids too. Secondly, this is the same argument used when interracial relationships started showing up more and more in media, it's simply quite dumb, interracial relationships are fine, also it's not like it's teaching kids to ""be trans"", all it really ""teaches"" them is that it's okay to be who they are, it's not like cis people in media made every kid cis, because else trans people wouldn't exist, and also even if it is making more kids accept themselves for who they are, and not hate themselves and kill themselves, that seems like a good thing to me.

""But being trans is a rejection of the way God made you""

That doesn't seem to make any coherent sense though, for example, I wear glasses when I watch tv, does that make me ""rejecting the way God made my eyes"", is cutting your hair a sin because God gave you hair so to remove it is rejecting how God made you? Also, even if it somehow was a sin to be transgender, the bible says in James 2:10, ""for whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it"", it also says several times that no sinner is worse than another, and to judge not lest ye shall be judged, so it's not like a trans person is any worse of a sin than anything you've ever done, and trying to drive people to suicide for it is awful, and is sinning in several ways, so you're only being more sinful than them by doing so, simply referring to them by their chosen name and pronouns is the biblically correct and righteous way to handle it,

""When we talk about socialism"" 

When we talk about socialism we usually get caught up in discussing a bunch of ideas, systems, people, and countries which I think have a tangential relationship with the ideas of socialism at best.

We talk about our vuvuzelas and our stalins and our north koreas, but in reality, socialism is based on two fundamental principles, which are democratic control of the means of production, something which I personally believe in, and decommodification, that is to say, take a market, and to uh.. remove it from market incentives.

Now, both of these elements of socialism have been practiced, by.. basically every developed country on earth, to this day, to some extent.

There are, for example, worker cooperatives in america - and in many other countries -, there are quite a few in latin america, for whatever reason, and the goal of these worker co-ops is to democratize the structure of the workplace.

The ""traditional workplace"" if you will

The traditional firm, the workplace we're used to, without co-ops, is one of tyranny, that may seem like a bold statement but it's actually completely true, you don't get a say in what your manager does, and your manager doesn’t get a say in what their manager does. It's a top-down autocratic system with an absolute control invested in the CEO or the board of shareholders or whatever, and all the power springs downwards from that point

And the way the CEO or the board of shareholders profit, is simply based entirely on the amount that other people earn that they are not paid

Their only way of staying alive is being forced to work at a workplace, and be paid less than they earn

if they were paid what they earned, the owner of the business wouldn't get any money

""Profit"" is the amount of money an employee makes you that you do not pay the employee back

now a worker cooperative can run a bunch of different systems

like for example you can vote

you can vote on a manager, or a system

and in the end it's here to help democratize the workplace

and in the few small examples of modern-day socialism we currently have, we see empirical benifit

It's been shown that worker co-ops tend to be more resistant to price shocks

generally more porfitable

more likely to survive the first 3 years of business

etc.

and then next is decommodification or however you spell it

every developed country again has at least some businesses or companies that have been decommodified from market incentives

like some have public options of healthcare, or giving free healthcare for all, which is in that sense removing it from market incentives

and then you've got all the shits like transportation networks, roads and things y'know

I don't have to pay for my driveway or highway

that's the state's problem, not mine

now when we take a look at industries like healthcare

So like

the ""free market"" is based on the idea that the supply demand curve will adjust to respond to the demand of any given item

but with healthcare, it's different

because it's essentially ""what amount of money would you pay to not die""

a lot of people will pay anything they have

cuz they wanna... not die

people will pay as much as they need for their life, as long as it's within their power

you know I'm spending all dem moneys on my insulin, I don't care

need interferes a lot with market prices and logistics

now some things I think markets can function fine without the decommodification, like most luxuries

but not everything

but the real question is, which markets should or should not be commodified

so what can we do to make as many people as possible live happier, longer, and preferably freer lives

so where does this proccess start?

and I mean

we already have worker coops, don't we

so we just keep moving from there

you don't know till you try y'know

""yeah, biden's better at being a pedophile""

 Well when his pedophile-ish-ness is sometimes being weird around little girls, compared to trump being best friends with f\*cking jeffery epstein I think there's a bit of a difference, also in terms of who's better as a president well obviously there are things such as coronavirus relief, biden has accomplished some of the more historic parts in this coronavirus relief, one of the big focuses is obviously going to be the quasi-ubi that he started with the child tax credit, um y'know this is the thing that most people talk about, with the slashing of child poverty, the assuring of food delivery to a lot of these children as a result of having that money to these families. We can also talk about the unemployment insurance, which was a great stimulus to the majority of the american people, I believe the US gave out more stimulus than any other country in the world except like japan I think, which I thought was great because the US is known historically as a country that is unwilling to give stimulus to it's people when they're hurting, the next thing we could go into could be afghanistan, biden was incredibly brave in pulling out of afghanistan, there are a million reasons why weaker leaders would have stayed, like they were worried they would get a bit of egg on their face because that pullout was never going to be clean, I think that given the doha deal that had already been signed in agreement with donald trump, who didn't involve the afghani government in that agreement, I don't think that anything else could have possibly happened with that but, perhaps we'll get into that later. Then third thing the infrastructure bill, the largest infrastructure bill in history that was passed in the united states, over 500 billion dollars authorized in new spending, like rob said a while ago that biden virtue-signaled on green energy when this infrastructure bill directly funds a lot of green energy, which is the opposite of virtue signaling, there's a million other things we could talk about, like the idea of blaming biden for fighting in israel and palestine when trump was the one who moved the embassy east from tel aviv to jerusilem is laughable, the idea that bombing syria makes him worse when trump also bombed syria, the idea that are enemies are emboldened when there was a widespread amount of disrespect for donald as a leader when he was doing things like photo-ops with kim jong-un, where even his secretary of state was telling him these talks aren't going anywhere, so if you wanna talk about emboldening enemies I think trump obviously won there

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""trans women shouldn't be in women's sports""

Well, I personally think that they should be on E for about 2-ish years before getting to participate, the reason men are on average stronger than women is because biological males produce more testosterone which increases capability to build muscle mass, so generally yeah if they do it immediately they will have an unfair advantage, however after 2 or so years taking estrogen, which reverses the effects of testosterone, they're on an equal playing field

Trans women have been shown empirically to not have any significant advantage over cis women after over 2 years on HRT, whilst there is still an incredibly small difference, it's small enough that there's no actual unfair advantage there, any more so than a cis woman with very slightly better genetics, although if that very insignificant difference is enough for you to find it a problem, there's always the option of making puberty blockers more accessible for question children, as it does do so fully rather than just 99.95% of the way, so that completely removes that advantage, the reason that currently isn't as common is due to transphobia causing reduction of medical care for children, and due to it only being done starting recently, though that will in the long run fix this problem. The only other difference, though still somewhat effected by hormone blockers, would be height, which not only is only helpful in a few sports, but also just isn't justifiable cause for complaint, that's like saying it's completely unfair for a 5'6 cis woman to be in the same sports category as a 5'7 cis woman",PrncssStrwbrry,t2_ieav05tv,0.9,8,11

We first talked about school situations for a sec, first introductions etc. They went to talk with a friend after that, while we waited for work stuff to start. Once they came back we were standing next to each other. I noticed them looking at me. Like a side eye, while standing next to me. At some point we started talking. While talking she would laugh and smile. I just talked about whatever and asked her the same as well. At some points they asked me if I wanted to take some dishes to the kitchen. I found this off like the rest of the stuff. I offered to get them dip and dots. And once we clocked out I went to get the dots. We had to walk to her friend as I also got dots for them. And when we walked back I popped the question and they didn’t stop to think.  
  
They responded with an order of 4 nuggets, and I asked if they wanted a combo, to no response.  
  
I did this all without realizing the origin of this phrase. When I looked it up I just lost it and figured I might of just blew it.  
  
[Michael Asks Out A Fast Food Restaurant - The Office US](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4xLpzSRNOc&t=97s)

  
The TLDR of this office segment is Michael calling Wendy's for Wendy, and getting met with a response of ""dude this is a Wendy's restaurant"". This was later interpreted as ""Sir this is a Wendy's"" by internet culture.  
  
I am dying at the thought I made a light hearted joke, and only after I find out the meaning.  
  
I will see them tomorrow; I may be able to gage how comfortable they are. They might of been busy or I am just overthinking it.

It's innocent until proven guilty, unless the matter in question is about something a guy did to a girl, then instantly about 80% of people automatically believe the woman without considering the consequences for the guy if she's lying.","Woman says a male in her workplace makes her uncomfortable? They instantly believe her and fire the male 90% of the time, the other 10% is toxic in the opposite way though, with an atmosphere of sexual harrassment.

Female fakes defensive/abusive injuries on herself and calls the police? BAM, instantly the dude is arrested, no matter what the guy or other witnesses say. Even if only the male has injuries and he's the one who called the cops 90% of the time they're both getting arrested or just him. 

And of course the biggest example, false rape claims. If the male isn't a member of the upper class, when a woman publicizes a rape claim it basically destroys that man's life, even if eventually the courts determine that the woman made everything up. (This is a whole separate issue from the low incidences of rape convictions and reporting, please do not bring that up, those topics have been done to death already.)

319,cv8vbr,2019-08-25,teenagers,some racist woman thought I was syrian and tried to get me kicked out of a store,"tl;dr is in the title, dumbass.     
Ok, to preface the story, I am a young black male, but only like half black, so I kinda look like a Syrian (just kinda). A lot of Syrians and Arabs have tried talking to me in their language, and I just kinda have to say ""sorry bro I only speak English and German"", but I have never experienced something like in this story.            
So I was in an electronics store in Germany called Saturn, just looking around. I see some laptops with 144hz and 3ms monitors, and I think ""damn, those are thin af!"" so I go over to look at their specs and stuff, and while I am, some old woman (in normal clothes, no uniform) came over to me and pulls out her phone. My first thought: "" Oh god oh fuck please don't ask me for advice with your phone rn I'm really not bothered, I just wanted to look at the new games on sale."" The woman says: ""Hey, you better not start with your Arabic shit, ok?""     
(Side note: this didn't really annoy me because i have experienced a lot of *kinda-racist* moments, but not to the point where the people actually hate me because I'm black)        
So I'm just kinda standing there, still asking her in my head to not annoy me, when she says ""My coworker just told me that you were typing some stuff in a foreign language, and that doesn't work here. you're gonna have to leave."" (remember, I wasn't touching the laptops, just looking at the info)            
so at this point she didn't say what I thought she was gonna say, so I kinda have to process it for a second. and after like 20 seconds of me staring her dead in the eyes, widemouthed, I burst out laughing and walk away. while I'm walking, this woman is like ""bruh you still have to leave"".
Me: ""bruh im not Syrian or Turkish or Arabic. I was born in germany, my mom is German, and the only reason I'm black is because my dad is. you are so fkn dumb please leave me alone""             
at this point the woman is staring with a real ""oh shit"" face, and then walks away. do I go to look at some computer parts and tell my dad about the story. and then, while browsing through video games, I have the revolutionary thought: ""yo if this racist ass woman wants to kick me out for no reason, imma make sure that she gets kicked out."" so I walk over to security and while doing so, I see the racist woman walking over to me. I therefore hurry up to get to security, but it's not worth it, as the woman interrupts me right after I said ""excuse me, sir"". she tells me that her 'co-worker' is ""so terribly sorry"". so this time I cut **her** off and get pissed. so I ask her stuff like ""well why aren't foreigners allowed to type on the keyboards but Germans are"", ""why do you only want to apologise once you realise that I'm not an immigrant"" and ""well if your co-worker is **sooo** sorry, then he can apologise to me personally"". but then my dad comes over, screams ""YOU RACIST"" and dragged me outta there. he then lectured me that if someone is racist to me, I should just call em a racist and leave. I don't believe in that tho, coz you're gonna be pissed off afterwards, and imo, the best way to not become pissed off is to laugh it off, and in this case I was gonna make her feel like ""oh shit what have I gotten myself into"" and then laugh at her stupidity. it's even scientifically proven that if you laugh or smile while mad, you will get less mad",lolbro911,t2_2m951qwr,0.97,2306,176

I work in a restaurant, and after a particularily busy day the owner's (who's a really nice guy) wife came by. I was just calculating the tips (26€) and the owner told me to split it in 3 (since there were three employees). I, without picking up a calculator, tell him it's 8,67 a person, and he tells me to round it up to 9. She, however, is certain that it is actually 8,30, because 3x8 = 24 and 2 / 3 = 0.30 (wtf you are a grown woman). After going back and forth a bit she's almost yelling at me, which caused the attention of some people around us. I then showed her, using a calculator, that she was completely wrong. She stuttered a bit then quickly changed the subject. She was, not even a minute later, talking about how she should get a share of the tip too (jokingly) because she helped clean some tables (which I usually do) while I was on my break (it was 10 PM and I hadn't had dinner yet). I said (again, in a joking matter) that she should take it up with the big boss, and she then said, while laughing, that he couldn't afford her since she made 5 times as much as me.

370,18gwo4k,2023-12-12,teenagers,Today was bad and it's only 4pm,"TLDR; Expectations, expectations, and I'm not meeting any of them.

I got taken to get tested for the flu, covid, qnd strep throat cause I wasnt feeling well (turns out it's just allergies). Before we went inside my dad was talking about how he has to pay a traffic ticket and asked me to help him pay it. We called, went on the site, and he ended up saying that he'd just pay it in person. This is where I screwed up. After we came out of the building, we started heading to the place to pay the ticket. On the way, he started saying that it was stressing him out and that I wasn't being of any help. So I asked him how I wasn't being of help. He started saying that my older sister was quick, she would look for ways to help him, and that I don't do anything other than go on my phone. I know I'm not the most tech-savvy and pretty slow, but I was trying to help him. I asked him, ""So do you want me to pay the bill online?"" He said to not do anything. Then he was saying that I don't help him and blah blah blah. I decided to just pay it online and he seemed to calmed down. Why didn't he just ask me to do it? Just tell me straight up because I'm not good on picking up on signs lol. I thought he'd calmed down but then he started on how ""no te pones las pilas"" which in short is that I'm slow. He started saying that his friend's son helps with his company and that he's in the same grade that I'm in. We've argued about it before. He says that he wants me to manage and help him start his company and I've expressed no interest. He made me feel like shit for not taking on the responsibility of taking care of a company by saying that he wanted to do it for me and my younger sister. He says that he wants me to learn, by myself, the ways of business. First of all, he doesn't have a permit, the money, or the business knowledge to start one. He's gotten scammed before by a car dealership. His finances are in ruins because of a car he took on with his name for a girl. I knew that he was pursuing a woman, but I didn't know that he'd get a car with a 27% interest rate and so far hasn't been able to pay it off. He's smart, but not money smart. If he wanted me to help him every now and then, which I've done before, I'd be cool with it. However, managing his company isn't something I'm cool with. I know I'll make mistakes, and I don't wanna be responsible for making or fixing them. I was trying to find the purpose in everything that he was saying. Did he just want me to pay the ticket? Why'd he bring his friend's business into this? Why does he expect me to take on that responsibility? Is he just stressed and taking it out on me? I feel bitchy for saying this, but I don't want those expectations. I don't wanna have to do that thinking for him. He's raised me and my older sister, for the most part, by himself. I believe that he's just trying his best. When I was younger, I knew that we weren't in the best place financially, and tried to rationalize with all the brain power a 6 year old had. Now that I'm older, we're better off, but still not completely stable. I end up tieing my thoughts together with ""You're not helping, you're just making it worse."" And it's true. I want to help, but I don't wanna help with what he wants me to help with, and we both just end up mad.

Once we were in the CVS for my medication, I got a call from my mom, and she said asked me what I was picking up from CVS. I've always had problems with my mom, but don't want to sever ties because I know that she's trying. I said that I was picking up allergy medicine and then she started saying that my body has to fight it off that I can't take the shit that doctors give me and that I choose to take the ""bad"" stuff I'm given by my dad and doctors saying that ""the stupid doctors wanted to give me steroids."" They didn't even give me steroids. I started crying cause like girl I was already having a bad day now you too? My dad was asking me as to why I was crying and I just wanted to say that one was giving me shit about a company that I want nothing to do with and the other was telling me not to take the medicine I was prescribed. I got the allergy medication along with some antibiotics and still had that conversation in my head. I was given antibacterial eyedrops, but I was already given some by an optometrist after finding out that I had blepharitis, and told my dad that I wasn't gonna use them. He got mad real quick and started yelling saying to not use anything and to just throw it all away. I started crying from frustration.

Now I'm at home typing this out and wanna disappear. I don't even know how I should process any of this because I don't even know how to think for myself. I feel like I'm just being sensitive.

I'm a straight-A student and really care about my grades bc I have desi parents and yk its important. so anyways I worked super hard on this one business assignment (business is one of my strong suits and I enjoy it btw) and literally worked my ass off on it and I needed help in one part of it and asked my teacher, AND THIS WOMAN LOOKS AT ME AND STARTS CHUCKLING AND WALKS AWAY. LIKE I'M ASTONISHED WHAT THE HELL. like ok, that's not even bad right that's fine idec but then i show her my draft and she's like ""Oh wowwww gjjj A+"" and I'm like oof thank god it's good.

So I fixed up my assignment a lil according to the feedback I received and submitted it yk happy with my work and everything. I got my result back this morning. IT WAS C+ LIKE WHAT IN THE WORLD, she gave me false hope, and if she truly thought my work was a C+ why did she tell me my draft was an A, and why did she give others an A when they did half the assignment incorrectly??? It's not like it's the worst thing in my life and not like I've never gotten a C+ before.

I've had other experiences with this teacher where in class I was fiddling with my pencil case I little like zipping and unzipping it, it's not like it was making any noise it was a pretty smooth zip. This woman walked up to me literally said ""ur interrupting my class"" snatched my pencil case, and told me to get it back from her at the end of the lesson.

At the end of the lesson she had the literal audacity to come up to me and say, ""Show me ur notes from today's class"" and then got mad at me when I didn't have anything written down after she literally took away my pencil case.

386,jukcol,2020-11-15,teenagers,I made an old man cry at work today.,"This is kind of a big story, so let me start basic.  


I work at Kmart in a store in Australia, and our stores (dunno about other ones) have kiosks where you can upload photos from your phone and have them printed at the service desk. Anyway, I was working at the service desk today, scanning people's returns and trying to get through the busy Sunday shift. I hadn't noticed yet but standing in the que was a somewhat tall, a little hunched over old man with glasses that looked more like swimming goggles. It had been a busy and stressful day so far, so I was focusing on the task and didn't notice him yet.

I finished serving the customer and he walked up to me, very shyly.  
""Excuse me young man,"" he started, trying to gently get his old Iphone out of his pocket, ""could you please help me with the photo machines? I'm not very good with technology.""  
My first reaction was *""oh real cliché, an old guy who needs tech help goes straight to the 16 year old.""* Luckily however, I made the decision to leave the rest of the people in the que for my workmates to serve, whilst I helped the customer.

We get to the kiosks and I immediately see the problem. He pulls his Iphone 4 out and he is starts to put his password in whilst holding the phone upside down.  
*This guy doesn't need help. He needs someone to do this for him,* I thought, as he passed me his phone which is opened to his emails.  
""Can you please print that photo?"" He says, as I look at what he has. It was a beautiful shot of some army-looking jets on a runway, with a symbol in the sunset and the caption *""1970-1989""* underneath. It was a stunning photo really, but trying to print it over emails would mean that the quality would be really poor. I told him that and he kept going ""Oh, that's alright.""

So I hooked up his phone, went through the options like sizing, glossy finished and whatnot. I asked him what he wanted, but he never gave me straight answers. ""Oh, if that's okay"" he always said. We settle with 3 custom prints of the planes.

But as I was scrolling through the options (I'm no expert at the photo kiosks) I accidentally pressed something and I see all 15 images he has on camera roll. A few of a small dog, quite a lot of someone's thumb, but there's about 7 images of a woman in there, taken August in 2019.

The woman looks about 80 like the old guy, she was much wider and larger that the guy and all the shots were of her sitting on a leather couch with several medals on the chest of her pink shirt. She looked quite unwell but she smiled in the photos.

Anyway, I think nothing of it and complete his purchase. That's the first time ever I have done someone's entire order for them.

We go back to the desk and I warn him that since the photo were saved through an email, the print quality might be a bit bad.  
""That's fine,"" he says, patiently holding his order slip. He payed the $3 and then said something all old people say like ""Oh you're help is worth more than that."" I can tell he is extremely thankful for my help and it makes me feel a little better as well.

One of the photos finish so I handed him one so he can look. And to no surprise, **the printing job looked terrible**, it was really low quality because of how emails compress image files.

I turned away and began putting his other two in a folder, somewhat disappointed in myself for how shit the photo quality was, before I turned and looked at him.  
He was staring at the sample I gave him, with his glasses on the bench and his face turned red. He wiped his eyes and sniffled, his gaze never lifting.  
""It's beautiful,"" he says, still locking eyes with the print.

Then he looks directly at me. His eyes are completely red and glistening in what I can only assume is happiness. I hand him his other two prints in the folder and I try to say ""That's everything"" or ""Thank you"" but my voice is lost. Personally, I am a very emotionally controlled person, but seeing this old person react like this broke me.

His voice was still cracking as he took the prints and began to walk away. I was lost for words, and then I found that my own vision was blurred. Continuously thanking me, and getting increasingly louder, he turned and broke into a burst of tears, walking away and holding the photo in front of him as he left my sight.

I was frozen solid, still processing what had just happened. Then it hit me. The photo of the old lady on his phone who was wearing the medals, had been taken over a year ago. The man had come in alone, quiet and shy with his only goal to print the photo of the jets in the sunset with the *""1970-1989""* caption. 

I might have just printed a memory of his wife.

End story.

Notes: I still have no idea whether that last part is true or not, but I can't stop thinking about how that all happened. If I wasn't there at the service desk when he was, if I hadn't of decided to help him order the photos, if I had just ignored him and told him that someone else would help him, would he have ever gotten those images of the planes?

I made a choice today: *Spend my time and effort to help this guy* or not.  
My whole life I have never felt like my choices or actions had ever affected anyone before. But I came home from work today completely silent, still thinking about how different that old guy's afternoon could have been if I had made the wrong choice.  
So I ask you, to make the right choices every day, because you have no idea how they are gonna affect other people.

399,1aigcuq,2024-02-04,teenagers,Horseshit English Teacher,"This might be a long post but i need to get this off my chest. So our school had really only two senior year english teachers, one of them restricted to AP Lit, the regular and dual kids are relegated to this particular teacher. For the sake of privacy she’ll be referred to as Ms. Birch. Ms Birch is a genuinely nice woman, but holy fucking shit she is the most dogshit, incompetent, pretentious person i’ve had to deal with. 

Usually English teachers have the stereotype of digressing about their personal life and unrelated business. This is fine when you are still learning for the most part and is someone related to the topic. The issue with Birch is that she’s a chronic yapper. I don’t like saying that any teacher or instructor just yaps, but it’s the most accurate description. She will discuss late assignments and at a whim will discuss January 6th, she will spend 30 minutes straight complaining about having to grade papers then spend the next hour on the history of the feminist movement, she will talk about Antigone then talk about how we don’t have multiple choice tests then onto how she gave birth.

Now this sounds genuinely entertaining and fun, but then a week passes by and it’s the same shit, then a month goes by and you’re hearing the exact same points being made, you then hear content and personal details that should be left to a therapist, and now you just want to do your work. Keep in mind we are unable to even make any comment on any particular topic because she spends so fucking long. Class time is effectively a 1.5 hour yap session that you as a student gets zero value from. You have no choice but to listen to a woman who thinks she’s smarter than she actually is (a lot coming from a TEENAGER i know) and you will sit there any wonder what the fuck even is point of English as a subject.

The main issue i have is that this is actively distracting to the student’s learning and engagement with the material. I feel that my time is actively being wasted and i gain nothing from it. Keep in mind that this is supposed to be a college class, yet our assignments are the most brain dead fucking monkey logic ass objectives. I feel that my intelligence as a student is not being respected not only due to how the assignments are made but also her grading policy.

Birch is a really, REALLY, easy grader. It’s fucking impossible to fail as long as you turn something that looks like 3 pages. You get participation points for just showing up, min is. a 90%. This sounds amazing as a student, but it’s horrible as someone who wants to learn. This woman effectively refuses to have students fail which is nice from a pure number grade perspective, but students need to have some level of difficulty or so in order to have an incentive to get better.

This woman also spends hours complaining about things that are entirely preventable. For example having to grade papers on the last possible day. There is zero penalty to turning in late work last minute, and she refuses to grade anything until effectively the next month. The simplest solution is to just not accept late work, yet she doesn’t because of the aforementioned not wanting to fail anyone.

405,16d0ubt,2023-09-08,teenagers,I’m the other woman,"Today I found out I’m the other woman. And I don’t know what to do.

Tw this is long and unedited with tons of juicy drama 

So I (16f) have had an on and off crush on a guy (16m)for the past 2 yrs even when he (let’s call him Daniel) was in a relationship with a then friend of mine. I didnt want to like him because he was with my friend and tried my best not to feel anything for him which worked most of the time. But i couldn’t help it at times as Daniel is good looking, tall and always is kind to me and also always pays attention (with direct and constant eye contact) to what I’m saying. Even before the ex friend group broke up. But I always had the slight suspicion that he found me attractive. Because I know I’m attractive that’s something I’ve been self aware of for a while. But I never thought he’d try to get with me when he was with his gf. (16 f let’s call her Sarah) 

Him and his gf apparently have been on and off for a long time. But I discovered this later.

Long after the old friend group split I found out that they used to shit talk me behind my back including Sarah but Daniel agreed lightly because he was her bf. That’ll be important for a bit. But I heard from a few friends him and Sarah broke up so I thought maybe with her out of the picture I could finally have my chance. Because unfortunately for me (who was trying to get over him for agreeing with Sarah) we just happened to be in the same class this yr and he just happened to sit next to me.


That day (yesterday) we flirted it just kinda happened because I told him I knew about the shit talking because I couldn’t quite resist telling him because maybe just maybe he could be redeemable. He looked very sad that I knew when I told him and gave me a good apology after I forgave him. Telling him he was “the least bad” and he was only agreeing with Sarah. Thinking they had broken up. And he gave a lil smile when I forgave him. So he said “I’ll try being nicer to you this yr” I laughed at his comment then he asked me about my summer so I told him a bit about it. Then I thought I could try a lil with him as I thought he was single so I said “new haircut?” He said “yeah I like your eyebrows” (I dyed them over the summer)  I responded “well I like your hair.” I tried to talk to him more or see if he’d make any advances telling him bc I forgave him I’ll refollow his Insta. But he mostly wanted to talk to his friends. 

But when I noticed he mostly wanted to talk to his friends behind us I said “I’ll let you talk to your friends” and he gave me an affectionate glance and an appreciative thank you. 

At the end before class ended I told him not to listen to anyone who shit talks about me because there were many people who did including most of the old friend group telling him whatever they say it isn’t true. 

(Because it isn’t. Because they all didn’t understand I had adhd making social interactions harder so to some people I came off as annoying when it’s just my disorder.) I also told him I may sometimes have bad social skills because I have adhd and he said “yeah me too” 

Later I followed him on Instagram again and saw his Snapchat in his bio so I added him on snap chat too.

Hours later he followed me back and added me back which gave me lots of hope. 

So I texted Heyy which turned into a conversation till 11 at night where I mostly was the one engaging but he’d always instantly respond immediately or in a few minutes with double texting to make things he said sound nicer. I asked if I was bothering him or anything because “I was bored and nothing to do” and he said it’s alright. I even showed him my new cat which he called my cat cute. But at 11 I got tired and didn’t wanna look too desperate towards him so I said with a snap of me and my cat together “I’ll stop bothering you so have a nice rest of your night.” which he replied with a picture of his shoulder in bed saying “Ok, Gn” 

I thought I left left some mark on him or that I was breaking some ice on snap. So he could possibly think about me more. Or snap me more. Because for context I’ve never been in a relationship and I barely have any experience with love. 

But today didn’t have classes with Daniel but I still had my world turned upside down finding out I’m not the only one for him. 

I heard some bad things from my friends like he flirted with another guy’s girlfriend. But I brushed it off because after 2 years of invisible tension and morals, I thought I finally had someone who wanted me. And thrilled that it could be someone I liked back. Because for context I’ve never been in a relationship because I do have an attractive but intimidating look about me. Making me less approachable. Plus I’m not that popular because I can be awkward or again “too much”. For some people 

But I told a few more friends learning from a guy friend of mine that he heard Daniel and Sarah had a pretty bad breakup because he heard Daniel “did something bad at the end” but I didn’t care. They were broken up and sarah hated me for no reason possibly for jealousy. So at the same time a small part of me I thought it’d be a good punch back. Just imagining seeing her face seeing me and her on and off ex together. 

But I felt a bit nosy at some point before my next class today. so I quickly checked her snap story (bc I had her snap due to us formally being friends) because she had a little “ask me anything” up on her story one of the questions was “who’s your pinned person on Snapchat” and she replied with Daniel’s username. 2 swipes later someone asked “are you and Daniel still together” (as I think they broke up before summer break) and she replied yes. 

This completely broke me so I skipped the rest of school so no one would see me a mess and on the brink of tears. But for a good hour I cried in the school bathroom. Not even being able to see my texts to my friends well enough at times. So when I managed to clean myself up enough hiding my feelings inside I went home. A million thoughts of self blame or self sympathy in my brain. Not knowing who was at fault here.

the “still together story” was also apparently around the same time him and I talked.",Lovly097855353,t2_6b8ykh9w1,0.67,1,19

407,1aihvkm,2024-02-04,teenagers,I’m the other woman now,"Ok UGH it deleted last time I typed a paragraph so imma summarize this-

Details: me(f15) was at my friends As 16th birthday and her friend T (f15) was there too

I like joke flirting with my friends (im bi) and I was talking to T and flirting around with her and she was joking abt us kissing cuz my ex was there and to make her jealous and I was like lmao sure(idc abt my ex I just like kissing ppl) and T is like if ur down im down and she leaves and she comes back and im like im down if ur down 
T has a bf which she texted “hey is it cool if I kiss my friend to make her ex jealous?”
In which he responded “yea lmao” and joked abt a threesum
Since her bf said it was ok we kissed and she like pulled me in twice once and we ended up kissing 6 times but not making out just regular and like you coudl tell she wanted it more than I did
And I was talking to my friend afterwards and she(f16) is like “yea she seemed way more into it and when you pulled back after she pulled back in” 
And for context I do not liek her sexually it was js as a joke 

So I go home after the party and I text the birthday girl A and she tells me she lied and she never told her bf and he never said it was ok

And like I know it’s not my fault cuz I didn’t know but I do still feel bad for her bf cuz he seems liek a really nice guy even tho I’ve never met him

I’m not looking for peopel to tell me I’m an ass or whatever I know I didn’t really do anything wrong because I went off the fact I thought her bf was ok with it I just feel really bad

And for context T is bi too

Who tf expects you to just step outside and look like Kim kardashian on your way to work at Subway. Who? Who sis whoooooo???? 

It’s like a thing that’s all In Our minds to sell us things. Those skinny teas, makeup, skin lighteners, cosmetic procedures, it’s all to make a corporation money. None of it is actually real or holds ANY standing irl. Most ads have models using photoshop ANYWAY! It’s like some giant fake reality they’re trying to convince you is real. 

And I a way they make you THINK it’s real and young girls say things like “Well Im not eating today” in comments on TikTok like for WHY? Let’s actually talk about why you feel like you don’t want to eat today because you saw someone online who’s skinnier than you. 

Why? Because these businesses made you THINK you have to look like Victoria’s Angels. And then what? Do you get the job? The good grades? Did you get an A in Chemistry because you’re just thick or skinny or have the foundation the girl on YouTube used? 

It’s such a huge mind game and it’s WILD!!! Makeup is like a way to express yourself but jobs say you need to look “presentable.” Why would you not be presentable without makeup like the men? Sure, maybe hair but let’s talk about women with braids NOT being presentable in the workplace???

I will make a list, those who are popular on tumblr, so any person who might be against MRAs pops in here can see why MRAs are not evil and that I am not a feminist who lost her tracks.

Feel free to add or correct. This is a list that explains why MRAs benefit everyone... I know a list of ""not everyone is like that"" will follow and I believe it is because even inside a movement nobody will ever agree or follow EVERYTHING. These are just some things I've noticed and MRAs allowed my thoughts to come to surface instead of labelling me as misogynyst. 

Before labelling me as misogynyst, stupid, racist, whatever let's discuss. Labels do nothing.

I support MRAs because...

- we don't have to race to which gender has it worse. We both have our issues and censorship and death threats to Men's Conferences are not a civil way of communicating.

- as a woman I don't want to be discriminated on workplace. Women, nowadays, sue for everything - from dirty jokes to being fired because they have power to do so. I don't want a company to be afraid of hiring me because I can destroy them with a sexual harrassment cause.

- for this same reason I don't want companies to be targeted by gold diggers who file a lawsuit because they were fired - I understand that everyone does their own business, but the level of selfishness and greediness is too much sometimes.

- women have to stop using kids to blackmail fathers.

- women have too much power in court when it comes to kids and divorces. Women's power over children is the reason why I am here, too many of them are allowed and not punished when doing their own selfish business at the expense of the whole family.

- divorced women with too much power over dads have led to awful childhoods with no option for the dad to help because he'd be in legal trouble if he did.

- joint parenthood means both parents can concentrate on children, jobs and themselves. That means both being breadwinners and houseparent.

- I do not want my future son to be trapped into paying for a child until he is 18 just because a woman he went to bed with lied about taking sexual contraceptives. I want men to have a say in sexual reproduction and not just be told to keep his wiener inside his pants. I trust that a man will take a daily pill if it's made available.

- I do not want to be treated as a child. That's what most feminist movements do. I can decide for myself what to believe and who to support. I've never been as respected for my beliefs as I am here, with MRA supporters.

- affirmative action removes bread from mouths of people who deserve it.

- I DO have responsabilities and I want to face them. I am responsible for my happiness and I don't need to blame men for everything that is wrong in the world, in history or in my life.

- to me equality does not mean simply looking at what is best in another group and claiming it as unconstitutional if I don't have the same rights. I do not expect more women to have affirmative actions to enter ""clean/not risky"" jobs while the number of male garbage collectors remains the same. Same goes with working/being a house mom - you have the choice and so should you SO.

- I want dangerous women to be properly punished by the law and consequently re-educated. Punishments do not have to be softer or non-existent because the accused person is a woman.

- I don't want my future son to be demonized for his sexual desires.

- I want my future son to pursue the career of his dreams - be it engineer, nurse or housedad, without being forced to be the breadwinner and accepting a job he likes less and that puts his health to risk.

- I don't want my future son to be blamed for (perceived) unequal pay but expected to pay for dates and all sorts of leisures.

- both my future's son and daughter lives will be equally important and a crime against one will not be more important than the other. 

- I am personally tired of women caring about their looks more than anyone else and blaming the rest of the world for being unhappy about them or when they are not held on pedestals for their beauty. Some women are appreciated by more men and some by less, it's called beauty and blaming others as ""vain"" for not appreciating your looks is vain and bitter... especially when you'd never date someone who earns less than you.

- women feel entitled to males' attention and demonize them when it's not given to them. When a woman chases a man and he doesn't return attraction he's labelled gay. When a man prefers a body type over another he's ""not a real man"" (especially when he doesn't like extra weight). But god forbid a woman date someone who has lower education or earns less than her.

- women should follow the same rules men do. If a job training requires hazing  or extra hours then we should not try to bend the rules for us.

- I don't want my future daughter to embrace victimhood but to raise her sleeves and works towards her success and help her family succeed as well.

- women have to be held responsible for the problems they cause through sexuality and their sexual power to the other gender. If a woman uses sex to bribe someone then both should be punished, not just the person taking advantage of sex. 

- I am not owed anything for V day unless we make BJ&stake day a national recurrence.

- women can be as guilty as men in all areas of life.

- women have to stop encouraging men to be violent then blaming them for it.

- I don't want men in my life to suffer because they are afraid to speak up and ask for help since everytime they ask all they get is a cold shoulder or a rant about men having privilege and power.

- there are dress codes and everyone is supposed to respect them. Dressing as if you are flaunting your sexuality at school or work (unless it's required) is not a synonim of freedom. In some places if you dress showing your sexual attributes you will not be taken seriously just like a man dressed in a tight spandew suit wouldn't be, so don't blame men because they can't keep their hormones straight. It's not about sex, it's about image. Dress however you like when you vlog or go clubbing, but keep it classy when you are in otherplaces where you have to follow a dress etiquette.

When men's problems involve not being listened to, being disposable and women having too much power we all suffer from it. ",DianaDewAsmr,t2_btbe1,0.89,533,210
447,ppkfjn,2021-09-16,MensRights,I was sexually harassed by a woman at work. I reported her to her male superior and I was crucified.,"I was hired to work in a profession where more men are needed, simply because many women do not want to do some of the work involved.

My immediate boss was a pushy woman who did not understand the concept of boundaries. For example, she made telephone calls at all hours. I immediately make friends and one of the people I got very friendly with was a woman - we totally had no romantic interest in each other - and she acted more like a drinking buddy.

For some reason my boss did not like to see this friendship. For example every day, I had lunch with my female friend. But my boss warned both me and her that we were spending too much time together and I needed to spend time with people who were more knowledgeable in the work we were doing.

My boss started to call me over to her office on the pretense of explaining something or asking about progress on some project I was working on but she started flirting a lot and this involved her putting her hand on my thigh, near my crotch. Her language was also vulgar and amongst other things she made 'jokes' like asking me what size shoes I wore because according to her penis size is related to shoe size.

I sent her an email, copied in to our male, gay manager, outlining her behaviour and why I thought it was inappropriate.

I was horrified when I was fired but doubly so when she reported me to the police for lying about her and tarnishing her reputation! Incredibly the police are taking action against me.

Edit: Please understand that I cannot give more detailed information such as location etc. Others are asking me questions like what can the police do... etc. But I would rather not reply publicly as it might compromise my position and my future course of action. I thank you all for your support.

Edit 2: I thank you for the support you are giving me. I am not in the USA and while I find some of the comments really helpful I cannot give more detailed information as it may easily identify me. ",zogins,t2_3ngbcdr3,0.95,2493,236
448,160qu14,2023-08-25,MensRights,Feeling the burnout of feminism in the workplace,"So I wanna get this out of the way first, I can appreciate that woman still support feminism for various reasons, but I also don't think it's sexist or wrong to point out the fact that a noticeable amount of feminism is blatant misandry these days.

So I work for a relatively large corporate company, and lately I've been finding it rather tedious to sit through certain meetings or presentations regarding woman in the workplace, because they can blatantly talk negatively about men and disregard them entirely and it's deemed OK.

So we had this lady do a presentation on empowering woman to come into our industry as a career, the usual ""why aren't woman represented more in this field"". The correct answer is that men and women simply have different interests and this just isn't as interesting to woman as it is to men, but no, that's sexist think today. So anyway the presentation was happening, and this particular lady started talking about male privilege, white male privilege, all the privilege. 

A male co worker had politely pointed out that woman also have a level of privilege regarding the workplace, this lady was actually a gender quota hire, hired simply for being female. He pointed that out. She asked for him to be removed from the presentation for being disrespectful and hostile...

So one of the reasons this type of stuff annoys me is because male privilege isn't real. I've never felt like I've had any sort of benefit for being a man, especially when it comes to employment. I finished school and struggled to find work, every employer wanted the 18 year old with 20 years experience, I worked any odd job I could get for years, travelled around the country from town to town, living with relatives or living in hostels just to take these jobs. I flipped burgers at fast food places, worked telemarketing, hard labour jobs, you name it. I dealt with endless time wasting from potential employers, I'd travel a long distance for an interview only to be told then and there by a receptionist that the interview was cancelled, no notice and a generic fake apology.

I've dealt with mental health issues and being suicidal because the struggle to find permanent work was that hard and I was always broke. Finally, I got lucky and landed a job that provided on the job training. Now I work in this industry and while I still have your usual problems here and there that I'm sure everyone does, I'm always grateful that I finally have stable employment even if it's not always fun. Alot of men I know have gone through similar things, especially if they've had an injury at work and have had to try and get back into the workforce after that.

So this lady holding a presentation on how men just have life on easy mode and how they have all these advantages simply for being men, it's just exhausting to listen to. But if you don't attend you're seen as a negative person for the company, if you dare question these feminist woman and challenge their own privilege, like my male co worker did, you're removed from the presentation, and I wouldn't be surprised if HR gave him a stern warning about ""misogyny"" too. The most frustrating part is, imagine if I, a man, held a presentation on men in the workplace and how we don't get the same benefits woman do like being hired simply for being men, or being prioritised in the hiring process because the company wants to have more woman in the company, being hired even if you aren't the most qualified simply because you're a man. 

I've had to fight tooth and nail for everything in my career, so it annoys me because it really comes off as all of my hardships and struggles not being a big deal. But if I said the same thing about this lady, I'd most certainly be fired. But yet, nobody says anything. She even bought up the gender pay gap and used all the same lies and misrepresented info that feminists love using to talk about it. Everyone knew she was completely wrong, but nobody can say anything.

I'm just really fed up with having to go to work and listen to these ridiculous people complain about how everything they have isn't enough and that all the men in that room, men who have gone through alot to get into these jobs and climb the ladder to the positions they're in, are somehow privileged and haven't had to fight for those things. When these same feminist woman (I call them that because normal woman think these ladies are full of shit too), they refuse to acknowledge that they haven't had to work very hard at all to get into those positions and get very defensive if someone mentions things like quota hires. 

Has anyone else dealt with this at their job? We even had a lady who came on to talk about the struggles of being a woman in the workplace, and yet when she talked about her career it was all positives, she was just complaining about how she hasn't seen as much career growth as her male co workers, but even acknowledged that she took alot of time off to start a family and went back to work while her husband stayed home and how she struggled with the pressure of working full time and then coming home to be a parent too, like yea, men have been doing that for decades. That's how it is when you have children as a man, you still gotta go to work. Only these days you see the reverse, but these ladies complain about that now too. 

I'm booking a week off work because I'm just so sick of hearing about it, these ladies who send 3 emails and then need a coffee break, or forever leave work early because their children are sick or something and then they hold these types of presentations to complain about how they don't make as much money, it's because they're at work less often, even the other woman in our office have tried telling them this, but these feminist type woman just don't want to listen. It's like you've insulted them to say yea, you didn't get paid as much this month because you left work early 5 or 6 times and didn't work it back. I'm so glad there's ladies in my office who call this bullshit out too, feminism is exhausting and shouldn't be allowed at work what so ever imo. It's hypocritical that they can have these presentations and disregard all the men, but if a man were to do the reverse, there'd be hell to pay.",AdAny7443,t2_av01gb70s,0.9,41,28

I’m afraid for his future, what will wait him?

What I see now is other women nitpicking situations to blame it all on men.  

I recently had issues with workplace harassment from my boss, no not because I’m a woman, but because he’s a jerk on a power trip: Calling me up to 27 times in 1 hour knowing I was at the emergency room for having fallen down a flight of stairs.   Assigning me to projects that had already been taken care of  then blaming me, and even going as far as saying on a private message that me wearing a bikini on Facebook was unprofessional and not dignified of a worker from this prestigious multinational company.  Finding the most minuscule things and blowing up in public...

It’s not because I’m a woman, he’s an absolute cunt to everyone.  He wanted me to leave the company instead of firing me.  

But funny thing is, when I asked for help from all these associations for women , all they wanted to know was if my husband abused me, if my husband beat me....  otherwise they wouldn’t help.   

They asked me to file it as a sexual harassment from my manager and I refused, because it’s not sexual harassment, it’s just this idiot on a power trip bullying me so I quit the job. 

I could ruin this man’s life just by lying and the whole feminist movement would back me.

That’s absolutely disgusting.

So because I refused this, I was denied any legal help.  

I’m not trying to sue, I don’t want money... I just want my manager to back off, take some interpersonal skill courses... I want him to stop creating an impossible workplace environment for everyone.  I want my SJW company to actually be just and not back him up because it’s easier to not move him to another team.

If it’s not to demonize men, they don’t want any part of it.

451,11asgcb,2023-02-24,MensRights,Women need to be called out on their hypocritical use of sexuality in the workplace,"Why does nobody has the balls to call this out?!

Women use their sexuality in work and work related settings ALL THE TIME. When they want a favor from a coworker, when they need help, when they are looking for a raise or promotion, when they are trying to get a new client/customer.

I had several dates with highly successful beautiful business women and they all laughingly admit of flirting and leading coworkers or clients/customers on in order to get that sale, promotion or just get it ""their way"". Had a date where the female CEO said if the client is a man, she sends one of her hot employees, always. And i myself -of course- over the years first hand have seen women get all girly and sexy, start using their cute girly voice when they need a favor or whatever. Its so blatant and normal, everyone knows it.

Yet women flip the fuck out when a man tries to be flirty or tries to use sexuality in their favor. They act like its an  unthinkable immoral crime that needs to be punished. If you ask women if sexuality belongs in the workplace, they all say ABSOLUTELY NOT. Yet they use it every single fucking day. Hell women told me they dress sexier for clients when they want to get a deal/sale. They flirt, they drop sexual suggestions only to later shoot the man they led on down. This all would be fine...if they weren't hypocrites that literally try to cancle and destroy men who dare to flirt back or god forbid initiate a flirt.

Coworker or customer flirts with woman at work = Oh god look at that creepy piece of shit. He should be reported and fired, this doesn't belong in the workplace.

Woman flirts to get a sale, favor, promotion, raise = you go girl, hate the game not the player.",todoke,t2_3ovuh,0.95,742,105

454,17orep0,2023-11-06,MensRights,"Anecdote: Even the Average ""Non-Feminist"" woman supports Misandry","My mom and I were discussing workplace practices when the topic landed on dress codes. She was going on about how women are not allowed to wear sandals at some workplaces, and how much of a double standard that is to her. I pointed out that men are also faced with such dress codes, and cannot wear what they want either. I then told her that men face even more restrictions on what they can wear, such as being forced to wear a heavy suit, even in high temperature environments for some workplaces. She clung onto the fact that women had it worse in this department. I then replied by saying that women can wear both feminine and masculine attire, but men are only socially premised to wear ""masculine"" garb. 

The conversation then devolved into mom asking ""Why do you want to make this about gender?"". I then stated that I had to because this was the nature of the discussion. Then she questioned ""So you think that men are oppressed?"" I said yes, there is data and evidence everywhere that proves this. Afterward, she interrupted me and started going on with ""What about the fact that women are paid 3/4 for what men are?"". I detailed that men work more and longer, don't take maternity leave, and take on more demanding jobs, leading to higher pay. She then said ""That is a lie."" At this point, she was starting to get mad. 

I calmly explained that it is accounting for everything. Even then she was still saying that she did not believe me. I then explained that the wage gap has been debunked many times, but then she cut me off with the all too predictable: ""Name one way that men are oppressed."" I then rattled off at least eight things including: male conscription, homeless being overwhelmingly male, female on male DV being considered a joke, unfair sentencing for the same crime for men, police brutality: which targets men, women's health initiatives but there being none for men, etc... She then tried to victim blame men by saying that they somehow deserved it, because according to her: men are more dangerous and ""women are the vulnerable gender."" 

I called her out on it stating that if these statistics were to target women, there would be unfathomable outrage. I also told her that it is direct evidence that men are the gender that is discriminated against. She was not hearing it, and started to raise her voice. ""Do you know how much, I, a woman, have done for you?"" ""Why are you even defending men you do not know?"" ""If you lived as a woman, you would know how much we struggle."" ""Your time would be better spent focusing on something else, instead of the garbage you have been saying."" 

I then said that I stand by my word, and the evidence is on my side, and the fact that men are oppressed remains clear. She then yelled and said ""If you bad mouth women one more time, I will kick you out, and you will be living in your car."" and also asked me why I hate women. Keep in mind that I NEVER said anything remotely insulting about women, just pointed out how much men are disadvantaged in society. I explained the latter, and she replied with ""I don't care, the fact that you are focusing on this means you have a really serious psychological problem."" I didn't respond as I had already presented my case. 

Now, I have a part time job, and I'm a college student. I pay for my own education (I have a full scholarship which covers all my tuition, plus I pay remaining college expenses: books, fee's.. etc), most of my food, pay her 375$ a month in ""rent"" to help out, and I pay for my car, and I also do everything I can to accommodate. I only have a year of studies left, so I can make it even if she makes true on the promise, because I can transition to full time and work on weekends and take morning classes. I have several take aways from this:

One, even though my mom has said that she is not a feminist, she is clearly in favor of misandric policies. This means that although the average woman may not identify herself as a feminist, she IS one. Because she supports misandry and female privilege. The average woman doesn't advocate for equal rights for men, but supports feminism which is a hate movement against men. Meaning, men cannot trust their mothers to have their back, as they will side with feminism, betraying their sons. 

And two, mothers are not loyal to their sons. They say they love them, and support them unconditionally. But when the boxing gloves come on, their true resentment will be revealed. Mothers are women, and women have contempt for men. Therefore, it is given that a mother will drop her son in a heart beat if it conflicts with her privileged interests. It is inborn contempt as no matter how much a man does, the woman will still see him as a tool and will thus have resentment. This means mothers still see their sons as tools, not human beings. 

Thirdly, the men's rights movement is not up against ignorance, rather malicious spite and hatred toward the male sex. People in this community love to frame the issue as one of ignorance. IT IS NOT. We are up against hateful people who want to disenfranchise us further, and defend our disenfranchisement at all cost. This is a war. And in war, you do not attempt to convince your enemy of your rightness. We have to fight ruthlessly to gain your rights back. Never give into any feminist wanting to debate or argue as it is just hateful gaslighting meant to maintain the status quo.

Last Saturday at around 1:30 PM, because of the long weekend, Disney Springs in Walt Disney World in Florida was very busy.  And as it often happens in crowded places there was a line for the ladies room and almost none to the men's room. 

The particular restroom was located at the World of Disney store.  The men's room was busy, all the urinals were occupied but two toilet stalls were open.  I went into a stall and was doing my business.  I heard the door open and someone announced: ""woman coming in"".

This woman walks directly to an open stall.  She announces ""I am not waiting in that line.""  Followed by ""Y'all don't have anything I haven't seen before"".  

After she finishes her business, she walks over to the sink again announcing ""Y'all don't have anything I haven't seen before"", washes her hands and then walks out.  All the men in there kinda looked at each other like ""what just happened here""?

Had a call with a vice president of HR for the gym chain. 

They recognized my complaint as a serious breach of my privacy, stating that they make efforts to put up signs that a woman would be entering the locker room area and announced to say when she was (I had my headphones In and apparently didn't hear this). 

They sighted that the gym staff should have inspected and talked to all who were in the locker room and alerted us personally, however they take the same policy with the women's. Not sure if I believe that... Especially since she entered the women's on her own. 

The district manager and several other members of staff are being reprimanded/suspended for this.

I did not seek compensation, but also let them know that I had alerted the local news to this issue and would no long be attending their gym due to this. If anything comes of that I'll update with a YouTube link.

The Office of Civil Rights [sent me a letter](https://www.scribd.com/document/627583772/06222136-TWU-NDL-C?secret_password=36tppox1vx3L5xKeMMNd) announcing they opened an investigation based on my complaint. This information is verifiable via FOIA if you want, just request the document ""06222136 Twu Ndl c"" from the Dept. of Ed. and say it was sent from Dana Garrett in the Dallas OCR office in Feb 2023. A request of this type should be free. You can read the letter I linked for details about what they are specifically investigating.

What prompted my complaint to OCR that kicked all this off was that Texas State Bill 1126 declares Texas Woman's University (TWU) as a ""woman-focused"" university system. This means it is a violation of Title IX for the federal government to be providing federal student loans, research grants etc to TWU.

# Highlights

Where there is smoke, there is fire. I began looking into TWU for a comprehensive rundown of their public-facing violations. What I found:

1. The state is using them to provision grants and workshops to women who run businesses.
2. They run workshops for women to increase their political power. Increasing the political power of women is not bad. A public coed school discriminating is however.
3. They do not have sports roster slots for men proportional to the student body. Schools with a similar number (total count) of men are able to field 4-5 men's teams. As far as I can tell, there is only one male-presenting person on their rosters this year.
4. A litany of sex-based scholarships, grants, and opportunities at TWU. Heck, [they even advertise the violations explicitly](https://i.imgur.com/i5nylDK.png).
5. The student regent position has never been awarded to a man. This student serves on the board of regents for the university system and after a multi-phase selection process, is selected from one of two people by the governor of the state. OCR declined to investigate this.

The scale of the violations has led OCR to investigating entire *institutes* at the school. This is unheard of in my activism. Not once have I managed to get OCR to look holistically at a group running the violations. They have always focused on individual programs and ignore that a group that is committing so many violations is itself the problem. This is a tough thing to make happen, and with an OCR that tends to be hostile to men's complaints, getting this to happen means there are some serious problems at TWU.

# Timeline

A little timeline of TWU, partially sourced from their website.

1901 — The Girls Industrial College was founded by an act of the 27th Texas Legislature.

1930 — Graduate studies are established at the college.

1934 — The college’s name changes to Texas State College for Women.

1957 — The college’s name changes to Texas Woman’s University.

1972 — Men are admitted into TWU’s graduate programs and  undergraduate and graduate health sciences professions programs in  Denton, Dallas and Houston. **THIS IS THE YEAR TITLE IX PASSED**

1994 — Men are admitted to all undergraduate degree programs at TWU.

2018 — The Institute for Women's Leadership is established to  serve the State of Texas as a resource for scholarship and research and  to prepare more women to take on successful roles in business and public  service.

2023 — OCR opens a federal investigation into anti-male discrimination.

# Regarding Sports

TWU has had sports since before Title IX passed according to NCAA records. Yet, decades later, they are still out of compliance. To add fuel to the fire, TWU's athletics dept was heralding Title IX turning 50 last year. They were claiming that it is the reason their women can compete in what was traditionally a ""boys sport."" But that isn't the case, as TWU can provision whatever sports they want. TWU controls the rosters. They had sports before Title IX. So while they were running this huge campaign highlighting Title IX, they were knowingly in a violation since it's inception.

When I called them out on this while also announcing the investigation by OCR, they blocked me. This is a violation of my first amendment rights, as they are a government funded institution and I was commenting on policy and official actions. There are many court cases to support this claim. It was also retaliation for engaging in a federally protected activity. This has all been added to the investigation by OCR.

# Implications of Fraud

While OCR would never pursue it, there are some serious concerns regarding fraud here. Schools are required to attest to compliance with civil rights laws and funding regulations to get federal financial assistance such as student loans and grants. Given the decades of flagrant violations spanning the entire university system, TWU should have known they were not compliant. Yet they are getting federal money anyway. Anyone who attested to compliance has likely committed fraud. Absent media attention, no one will ever look into this. So get out there, and help me get the media to pick up on the story.

# What's Next

**Me:**

Title IX required that schools who were single sex prior to 1972 (when it passed) that are forced to move to coed must submit a transition plan to the dept of education. I have requested a copy of this transition plan via FOIA to see what it looks like and shine some light on what TWU did or did not do. They clearly failed at transitioning to being a coed school. TWU is has the worst gender gap for undergraduate schools larger than 4000 students (13% men), and the graduate schools larger than 500 students (10% men) using 2020 NCES IPEDS data.

I have requested a copy via FOIA of all the applications for student regent since inception, which applications survived each round of selection, and any notes the selectors included in their recommendation to the next round of selectors. I expect this will cost me a couple thousand which is fine. I plan on using it to appeal the dismissal of this specific allegation, or file a new complaint if the timeline to appeal has elapsed.

Contact media regarding this, no one has picked it up yet, and it is a huge story. TWU runs the risk have having their federal funding pulled over it.

If you are in the US, contact your elected federal representatives and let them know about the case. Ask what their thoughts and plans are for addressing anti-male discrimination and under enrollment in higher education.

If you are in Texas, contact your state representatives and ask about changing SB1129 so that it doesn't discriminate against men in violation of the 14th amendment's equal protection clause.",MRA_TitleIX,t2_gn9g7ooc,0.97,463,29
460,144jsw9,2023-06-08,MensRights,Men have it easier in the workplace? Thoughts?,"The stories below are from trans-men, who found it easier to be a man in the workplace. They were taken more seriously, were up for promotion, had papers published in journals when they were men, noticed other male colleagues being misogynistic, but not when they were women or transitioned to being women.

MEN AT WORK

**One day in court, Ward and his opposing counsel** were making a big request to a judge. Ward knew their question would not go over well, so he wasn’t surprised when she reprimanded both him and his opposing counsel for asking. What he didn’t expect was for the opposing counsel lean over to him and call the judge the c-word. “We weren’t out the courtroom door when he said that to me under his breath,” Ward says. “He never would have said that when I was female.”

Many trans men I spoke with said they had no idea how rough women at work had it until they transitioned. As soon as they came out as men, they found their missteps minimized and their successes amplified. Often, they say, their words carried more weight: They seemed to gain authority and professional respect overnight. They also saw confirmation of the sexist attitudes they had long suspected: They recalled hearing female colleagues belittled by male bosses, or female job applicants called names.

“If I’m going off-the cuff, no-one really questions it,” Ward says. “It’s taken as, ‘He’s saying it, so it must be true.’ Whereas while I was practicing as female, it was ‘Show me your authority, you don’t know any better yet.’”

Mitch Davis is now a director of organizational development at Planned Parenthood Federation of America in New York City, but he’s worked in HR for many different companies since coming out eight years ago. In one previous job, he heard his boss call female colleagues “old cows” and refer to a middle-aged job applicant as “Dame Edna” after she’d left an interview. “Evidently men say things like that to each other all the time,” he says.

Other trans men say they’ve heard male co-workers sexualize female colleagues when no women are present. “There’s some crude humor, some crass humor,” says Cameron Combs, an IT consultant in Olympia, Washington. He says he’s heard male colleagues do “appraisals” of women in the office or observe how female co-workers used their “womanly wiles” to rise up the ladder, conversations he says he never would have heard when he was a woman. “When they saw me as female, it was kind of an automatic stop,” he says. “It’s a little less censored, the jokes I hear, the comments.”

Some trans men have noticed the professional benefits of maleness. James Gardner is a newscaster in Victoria, Canada, who had been reading the news as Sheila Gardner for almost three decades before he transitioned at 54. As soon as he began hosting as a man, he stopped getting as many calls from men pointing out tiny errors. “It was always male callers to Sheila saying I had screwed up my grammar, correcting me,” he says. “I don’t get as many calls to James correcting me. I’m the same person, but the men are less critical of James.”

Dana Delgardo is a family nurse practitioner and Air Force captain who transitioned three years ago. Since his transition, he’s noticed that his female patients are less open with him about their sexual behavior, but his bosses give him more responsibility. “All of a sudden, I’m the golden child,” he says. “I have been with this company for 6 years, no ever recommended me for management. Now I’m put into a managerial position where I could possibly be a regional director.”

Trans women have long observed the flip side of this reality. Joan Roughgarden, a professor emerita of biology at Stanford and a transgender woman, says it became much more difficult to publish her work when she was writing under a female name. “When I would write a paper and submit it to a journal it would be almost automatically accepted,” she said of the time when she had a man’s name. “But after I transitioned, all of a sudden papers were running into more trouble, grant proposals were running into more trouble, the whole thing was getting more difficult.”

“As a man, you’re assumed to be competent unless proven otherwise,” she says. “Whereas as a woman you’re presumed to be incompetent unless proven otherwise.”

Edit- So done with some of these clowns who comment the same thing over and over again. If you’re gonna comment something and ridicule me about doing something nice for a child. Don’t even comment. 


As the title states I (20M) was at the park earlier today going to go on my daily walk and I went into the main office area where they have vending machines and I saw a kid wanting an ice cream so I went over to the machine told him I’d get him one and told him to point to the one he wanted. I then inserted the money and pushed the specific button. All the while this older woman was watching me and glared at me with a rude expression. After the kid got his ice cream I went over to the woman and asked her what her deal was and she said “I was just making sure the kid was okay.” And I responded with “And by watching you mean judging me and giving me a rude glare while doing a good deed? Not every man is a pedophile or a rapist or a whatever else you want to call them. Learn some respect.” 

At that point I walked out and went on my walk and I was pissed when I walked out. Why do people just assume that every single man is a threat?",-Blueberry-1,t2_7dzm0dor,0.92,437,144
463,ov48xv,2021-07-31,MensRights,Fatal workplace accidents in gender neutral language with a story about a woman who died,"Swedish taxpayer-funded National Broadcaster SVT covers fatal workplace accidents in gender neutral language. ""In Sweden 14 **persons** died in workplace related accidents."" They do not mention the 23-to-1 ratio between men and women who die on the workplace.

In Sweden 23 men and 1 woman died in workplace related accidents during 2020. Still the reporting is referring to gender neutral ""persons"" and we also get the story of an Italian woman who was crushed to death in a factory.

0.7% of breast cancer victims were male in 2019. Imagine talking about the 8.349 breast cancer victims as ""persons"" and then a story about a man who has breast cancer on national television. It will not happen.

A woman in Italy who died in a workplace accident is worthy of more attention than the 23 men who died while working in Sweden 2020. This concept of the expandable male... it's just...

464,184mokq,2023-11-26,MensRights,"Raped and abused by a woman, nobody cares.","Alright, so I am biologically a female, I don't really identify as one, though. So, I know you are wondering why I'm on a MensRights subreddit. When I try to talk about this stuff to other females, they always bring up men and basically show little to no sympathy. Every time I talk about being raped and abused by a woman, I always get. ""Men do it more. This was just an 'incident'."" Or, ""Shocking, Women don't 'usually' do stuff like that 🤔."" Sometimes I wonder how many female perpetrators walk around this world freely, all while toxic feminists and such say things like, ""Men love sex, women won't rape you because they don't need to force things on people to gain power, all men watch porn and they are nasty sex obessers, give me 'statistics' to prove me wrong.""                                                    

I once had a conversation with a feminist, a toxic one, of course, and she told me, ""A woman raped by another woman will never be as bad as a woman raped by a man."" So, you are telling me that rape is okay as long as a female is the perpetrator? Pretty weird, isn't it? It's kind of hard to say that males being raped by females is a ""rare"" occasion when most times when men are raped it's not ""actually rape"" or they must've ""enjoyed it"" for some reason. Who knows how many women rape when rape has more than one defintion to multiple different people? Rape is non-consensual and forced sex. Why complicate that? I didn't know having a p-nis automatically meant you wanted to be drugged, cuffed, or forced down against your will to have sex with someone. I also see toxic feminists say things like, ""Men hurt other men, women don't hurt men like men do."" So why does this subreddit exist? And why do I see women such as yourself spitting on men, hitting them, and shaming them, calling them all ""greedy rapists?"" Rape is rape. The perpetrator doesn't need to be a man, and the victim doesn't NEED to be a woman.                                        

When the woman who raped me did what she did, I nearly had a panic attack, I started sweating, and I felt like ripping off every part of my body. It hurt. I came to the realization that rape is completely evil and full of bodily suffering, and I didn't need a male to rape me just to know that. A man shouldn't have had to rape me just for me to realize how horrible it was. If a man or woman is raped by a woman, or another woman, they should still realize how disgusting and cruel it is. Just because the perpetrator is female doesn't automatically make it ""normal"" or ""not as bad as if a man did it."" Not every man wants to rape you, and not every woman wants to ""protect"" you. What that woman did to me caused me to bleed. I had scars on my genitalia. She, somehow, cut through my skin. She was a fetish. She had a fetish for ""blood play"" and suffering of another human being. It hurt like hell and put me in extreme distress.        

 I came across a female who said, ""Sex/rape isn't fair for women. Why would a woman want to feel a stick going up her?"" Oh, I get it, so a man's penis has to be forced up me just for me to feel pain and fear? Feminism is supposed to be about gender equality, not hating on every single man and protecting every single woman. ""I feel bad for that female rapist. What would make her do that ):"" There is no ""reason"" to rape, at least not a good enough one to justify what you did to that person. And it's the fact I've seen people justify female rapists too. ""She didn't mean it, she didn't know, she might feel empathy for you ): Don't blame her!"" Yeah, blame men even when they don't do anything wrong, justify women and say it was an ""accident"" or that it never happened so that she doesn't have to suffer the consequences for what she did. Blood, fear, pain, abuse, and trauma. All of those things were caused by one woman and inflicted pain onto me.                    

""Why can't men keep their dicks in their pants and stop raping?"" Why can't women stop sexually harassing/assaulting men by touching their genitalia and why can't women stop getting away with rape and why can't women stop getting away with hitting men? Why can't women be pedophiles, rapists, and killers? (They can). Why can't women be called out when they do nasty shit? Why is it that when a male is being abused sexually, physically, or violently it is more likley to be underreported and/or ignored than it is a woman? ""Why do men rape?"" No, the real question is why do rapists rape. Why do they even exist? Just because it's ""rare"" or not as reported, doesn't mean it doesn't happen or shouldn't be talked about when it does. Women do rape, women do assualt, and women are very capable of murder, torture, human trafficking, and abuse. I've seen women do/say some weird shit. 

Women rape, and until we bring more acknowledgement to that, ""It won't ever happen."" Because society is too busy protecting women from, sex craving, greedy, and harmful men to even look at what women do and what they are capable of doing. It happens. Men (and women), just don't speak up about it enough. ""I am a girl that was raped by another girl."" I have heard this many times, I have seen men online talk about being raped and abused, by women, many times. They teach young girls to be afraid of men, but they don't teach them to be afraid of women. It is a fact that many children don't talk about being sexually abused by women, because of the ""Lack of understanding."" You know? ""Why would a woman rape me? How could a woman do that to me?"" It isn't rape and it never happened. Just because it was a woman.",SadlyAliveLeslie,t2_meu81811c,0.92,346,133

466,1588ci8,2023-07-24,MensRights,Women have the burden of their appearance in the workplace myth,"**I grew up listening to this theory,** that women have to take care of their appearance all the time, which adds to the burden of their existence. It is only way more difficult, that they are forced to accept the constant flirting of men in the workplace, which is nothing less than harassment, as well as the ""social expectations"", that are being forced on them. 

**Sounds plausible.** Indeed, I need no make-up, my clothes are simpler to choose, my hair easier to take care of. I am not really being hit-upon in the office. My social expectations are not being reinforced on me verbally. But then I noticed how society functions.   


It is that they need to do all these things to reap the benefits, that an avg. woman in society has, which an avg. man cannot even fathom.

Women don't need to be so well-dressed in the office. They are allowed to wear simple clothes, every day the same if they want, crew-neck blouses and suits. They don't however. Furthermore, they like their translucent clothes, form-fitting dresses, heels, make-up and all the other nice stuff. I kid you not, last time I was in the office, I saw the panties of both of my colleagues in 4K and one of them also had a visible bra. They garner attention, that they claim later on that it is necessary. No it is not. It is just, that if you choose to dress like a man, you will be getting the attention of the avg. man. That is none. 

The societal expectations (which are being so incidiously differently defined, based on context) are another issue. A woman needs to be thin, beautiful, good mother, successful, rich or whatever else they claim that society enforces on them. Not really. Nobody enforces that on them. They want that, so that they enjoy the female attention. A woman might also be an adipose, she will just have the experience of a man with an average BMI and 20% fat, which is on the healthier side of the scale.   


It is also ignoring the fact, that a man is being born with those and opting out is kinda difficult. It is not easy to work in female-dominated professions (not only because of prejudice and scorn, but also because these professions seem to attack males), it is not easy to stay at home being a dad, it is not easy ""chickening out"", it is not easy having an average income. But yes, apparently women are being brough at such an uncomfortable position if asked about a family plan (which I get, it can be difficult, but then again, it is not a sexist thing). Or women are being driven out of manly professions because they heard a dick joke, whereas men have to live in this brutal environment and not say a word.

467,6uumes,2017-08-20,MensRights,Fuck office politics: newly arrived female coworker is in difficulty with her work and is attacking my reputation behind my back. WTF???,"The reason I post here is because many of the things this coworker does she can get away with it because she's a woman, and she's blatantly using female shaming tactics (people may not agree with the fact these are female tactics, but I think they are), *in the workplace*, to get her way...

She had a task: do her job and learn ho to do new things. Me (and others) supported her. After a few months I no longer had the obligation to support her and I realized she was slacking on purpose (facebook, amazon, chats, etc, instead of working). She... didn't like that. Because she had decided *not* to learn anything, when push came to shove and she needed to deliver, she went mad and started using the only coin at her disposal to fight the situation: social group, gossip, men-hating.

She started attacking me behind my back, trying to ruin my reputation. Her reasoning was that our boss was pressuring her to deliver, she didn't know how to do the job (spent months without applying herself) and because I was capable of doing it, *I had to drop everything for her*.

To quote her (a coworker showed me this):

- ""why doesn't Demian do it instead of me? He's the only one who knows how to do it anyway..."".
- ""I'm stuck with this, the *client* is an asshole, it's not clear what I have to do... of course it would be a lot easier if Demian supported me, but he never helps me...""
- ""this job is shit, can't do it... talk to me about your weekend :)""
- ""I asked X to give me a hand, I'm waiting for him. I watched this cool movie last night...""

Again and again, complaints in private to her friend (one of the PMs) in order to get someone to tell me to do the job *for her*. Never mentioning how she was told, when hired, that *she needed to learn this stuff*! Only implying how she's willing to do the job but my lack of support is blocking her (false and shameless accusation)...

She decided by herself that team work meant she was excempted from every responsibility. This is an example of a chat conversation:

- SHE: demian, you are not busy, right? :)
- ME: I'm busy, sorry.
- SHE: eh... you are doing research... can't you help me with this?
- ME: sorry, but I can't help you. Try to take it slowly and face one problem at a time, you'll get there.
- SHE: but I need someone to show me how it's done...
- ME: and I sent you lots of material months ago, I can't do the job for you..

She grabbed the last message and send it to four different women and a guy so they could support her in bashing me.

I had to protect myself after that. I intervened with certain coworkers and made sure my version was known. After a few days, she made so much noise and her work was so behind that my boss asked me my opinion on her and her work. 

Because of what she did (the chat convo was just one occurrence of her gossip), I sunk her in front of my boss. I spent almost 8 months without saying anything negative about a coworker (her!) in order to avoid putting her in a difficult spot, and what does she does?

She targets me because I don't go over mountains for her (where does the entitlement come from lol????) and decides to fuck with my reputation, just because she was lazy and had to choose between admitting her lack of knowledge to my bosses (damage to her image) or use social games to blame *me* instead (damage to *my* image)...

-------

Right now, I was promoted and next month I'll be in charge of her work. At the moment, she latched onto another coworker, constantly ""asking"" him how to do things, constantly ""asking"" him to look up stuff for her by saying ""she doesn't know how to do the job..."", and implying he has to because of ""team work""...

While the guy looks for stuff up, she opens her chat or facebook and starts doing random stuff or talking with her friends, waiting for him. And the spineless guy refuses to say ""no"" to her, is depressed and overloaded of work all day, and earns even less than she does...

And by the way, whenever the guy can't cope with it anymore and snaps at her, she starts gossiping behind his back telling everyone how this guy is having his ""ladies days""...

The three of us were on the same role inside the company, but unlike us, who focused on the job, she focused on her relationship with the others. At first I thought this wouldn't be an issue because we are all different, until she started using that ""support group"" she formed to backup her up on her lack of skills and all her BS...

Fucking office politics. And fuck women who blatantly push to establish social bonds with other women and then use gossip to get their way against men who actually work and don't give a crap about this stuff...",demian78,t2_ax22xax,0.89,937,219

474,15qgwv7,2023-08-14,MensRights,Workplace Gender Discrimination?,"Hello! I was hoping someone could tell me if what I’m experiencing is actually discrimination and worth going to HR. Apologies in advance as it's very long:

The entire division went away for a team offsite to do training, team building, etc. During the second day we had what they called speed dating where one side would rotate and you’d have 2 minutes to connect with each team member. When the division head and I had our 2 minutes, the first question she asked me was how is married life. I responded that it was great. The second question was why did you get married. I immediately felt uncomfortable. When I responded that I love my wife and wanted to begin the next chapter of my life with her, she responded that doesn’t seem like a reason to get married. She then asked me how long did you date your wife before you got engaged and when I responded she said that doesn’t seem like a long enough time before you proposed. I felt even more uncomfortable and I tried to change to subject and asked if she has any travel planned in the near future. I told my manager at a team dinner later than night and she said that’s ridiculous she would ask you that question but otherwise brushed it aside and didn’t escalate.

Later during the offsite, we had breakout team dinners where groups of roughly 10 people were aligned with 2 team leads for dinner. After everyone’s dinners, many people met at a bar. I saw a team lead inappropriate touch and essentially hit on lower-level team members. One of the team members felt violated and screamed for him to stop and she came over to me to essentially save her. I was one of the few sober people there and tried to control the situation. There was another team lead there, but he didn’t do much to control the other team lead. The next morning, the woman and I made a comment to our manager during lunch and the manager went to HR to raise this issue. During the next two weeks, my manager would regularly say to me in our 1:1s make sure when you get interviewed by HR, you say the full story of what you saw and also share how the team lead made everyone feel. It was as if they had a personal vendetta against him before this incident and they wanted to get rid of him. I’m definitely not saying what he did was appropriate. A week later, the division lead pulled me aside in the lobby before we went our separate ways. She said, I’m not sure if you are quiet in your personal life but you can’t act that way at work. You should have stepped in and stopped the team lead at the offsite. When I explained that there was another team lead there, she cut me off and said I don’t care it’s your responsibility not his. I responded how I attempted by telling the team lead to stop and how the woman came to me but the division lead cut me off saying you don’t need to say anything else; I’m just telling you not to act professionally the way you might act privately outside work. I felt very uncomfortable, bullied, and it was as if I did something wrong. I was interviewed by HR about the incident with the woman and after explaining the story, she made it very clear I did nothing wrong and if anything, it was the other team leads responsibility to get involved and the fact you did more than him speaks volumes. A few weeks later, the team lead that was inappropriate was fired.

A few weeks later, I had a 1:1 with the division lead scheduled for 15 minutes. Everyone on the team had these 15-minute syncs scheduled over a few months. I came prepared to the meeting with a list of numerous questions such as giving her an update on what I’ve worked on and accomplished recently, asking what was on her radar for the next quarter for a leadership level and also if there was anything I could help her out with or further help the team, I asked if she had any recommendations for me in terms of developing my career at the company. For all of my questions, she gave one-word answers and it was very obvious from her expressions and not paying attention that it was the last place she wanted to be. When I asked about career development at the company, she told me “you don’t get it and you should get on a project”. When I told her I’ve told my manager for the past couple of months that I’d like to get on a project, she said oh and that was it. I still to this day don’t understand what she means that I don’t get it especially since all of my reviews, goal results, and feedback have been strong. The 1:1 lasted 6 minutes even though it was scheduled for 15 minutes. I asked others how theirs went and the women said she gave lengthy responses and was helpful while some men I asked said it was as bad as mine. I mentioned to my manager that my 1:1 went poorly and she said she wasn’t surprised and will try to do damage control whatever that meant. I asked my manager if she thought the division lead had something against me or if there was gender discrimination. She said I know she gives men a more difficult time than women and that there is a treatment level difference between genders. I was very shocked but not surprised based on everything I’ve seen.

Also, the sub-team I’m on is only women and me. My manager seems to treat the women on the team, most who have been with her for many years, significantly better and works to get them promoted multiple times over since I’ve been here over the past 2 years. Also, my manager has made statements over the past 2 years on other men mansplaning things to her and also her issues with how many men there are compared to women at the company and how she wants to try and balance it out.

I also want to say, the division lead and my manager are extremely close and I know this will be held against me and also she won’t admit to things in order to protect the division lead.",jf8617,t2_500v2568,0.9,31,18

The mining magnate urged women to be available and work through lunch breaks and holidays to prove they are worthy of promotions, the Daily Telegraph reported. 


'When I'm asked to give advice, I say to women, if you want to go further up the ladder, what you should be doing is working through lunches, working later, be willing to work later. Willing to, even on holidays or public holidays, be available,' Ms Rinehart told the publication.


'Because what you should be wanting is that you've achieved that position yourself - you are worthy of that position.

The mining magnate, who was estimated by Forbes to be worth $22.83 billion in 2018, said women shouldn't rely on quotas to advance in the workforce.


'It's got to always be, if a woman wants an executive position, they should put in that extra, put in more than their colleagues,' she told the Daily Telegraph. 


Ms Rinehart, who inherited a majority stake in her father's mining company in 1992, transformed the business into a billion-dollar empire during the iron ore boom.


The 64-year-old, who says she is 'never not working', has never been one to mince her words about work ethic or show sympathy for those who complain about money.


In a 2012 article for Australian Resources and Investment magazine, Ms Rinehart said those who wanted more money should spend 'more time working'.   


'There is no monopoly on becoming a millionaire,' she wrote.


'If you're jealous of those with more money, don't just sit there and complain - do something to make more money for yourself.


'Spend less time drinking, or smoking and socialising, and more time working,' she wrote. 
The daughter of Lang Hancock, who she inherited her business from, said she doesn't believe quotas are enough for female advancement in the workforce

Her comments come after reports from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency were released on November 12 - which show women continue to be paid less than men and are far less likely to hold executive positions. 


While promotions have risen from 39.1 per cent to 43.3 per cent in 2017-18, the gender balance at the top remains static. 


Female CEOs increased by 0.6 to 17.1 per cent and female board representatives reached 25.8 per cent after creeping by 0.9.  


Despite an increase in gender equality policies and a decline in gender pay gaps, men still take home $25,717 a year more than woman on average, according to the WGEA 2017-18 Data Snapshot. 


Ms Rinehart's industry, mining, remains the highest-paying for both genders and has dropped from 11th to 14th on salary measures in terms of gender pay equality. 


Her other primary industry, agriculture, has a 21.6 per cent pay cap - the second worst industry for gender pay disparity.   


Men make up almost two-thirds of full-time employees - a reflection of stereotypical gender roles in the family and women taking time away from work for motherhood.

The Director of WGEA Libby Lyons highlighted improvements over the 2017-18 period but said there was still more to be done.


'Although the proportion of women in management has increased, most senior roles, especially at the CEO level, are still dominated by men,' she said.


'Again this year, there is virtually no improvement in the number of women around Australia's boardroom tables.'


'Just over 35% of the boards and governing bodies in our dataset have no female members.'    ",ObeyTheCowGod,t2_4943e,0.95,45,16

It's that the fact men die ~93% more while working is invalid because ""men won't let woman work in dangerous professions."" If you belive in the patriarchy its easy to see how this could make sense, and because the lie of the patriarchy is so engrained in our minds it is very easy to see how so many people belive this. 

But this is so fucking insane, it's not ""woman can't do dangerous work"" that is the problem, it's ""men must do the dangerous work for the women, but also has to act like they are monsters for not letting the woman do the work even though they're the ones who made them do it in the fucking first place!!!"" 

I remember in sixth grade social studies we were having a class discussion about the male only draft and I said how unfair it was that only men had to be drafted and the teacher said ""yes its very misogynistic against women"" and my little 11 year old brain twisted up with confusion and broke.

I think one of the biggest reasons I was able to unlearn toxic feminist rhetoric and open up to MRM this past year and a half is because I wasn't in school anymore. Your environment controls you so having control of your own environment is the best way to learn truth and unlearn lies. 

Yes, there are toxic parts of MRM, but exponentially less then in feminism. I was taught that Men's Rights was only a place of hate but 99% of what i've found is love and support. Thank you all.",chucklesomeDordoise,t2_4dey30e9,0.96,281,88

He has very clean healthy blonde hair that is long but he always puts it in a tidy bun or tidy ponytail. Sometimes he will even slick his hair back into a bun for a more formal approach.

A woman on this programme said that 80% of books on the GSCE list (The GCSE = General Certificate of Secondary Education) were written by men. I went through the list and in most categories the gender of the authors is roughly equal. However, the gender quota is skewed by the fact that a large number of plays by William Shakespeare are included. When I was doing my GCSEs we also studied stories by Geoffrey Chaucer and this further skewed the list towards men. But Geoffrey Chaucer and William Shakespeare are required reading and studying for anyone trying to understand the English language and its development.

She then said that, nowadays, most book readers are women and there are more women authors than male ones. So she proposed a business where she targets only female customers and sells them only books written by women. Moreover the boxes she sends her clients are pink and contain small freebies like a lipstick or a hair band.

It took one of the female multimillionaires to point out to this woman that she was excluding 50% of the market and that if she wanted to promote female authors she needed to do it with men too. Another female multimillionaire told this woman, that she had two young sons and they would definitely not read anything that came out of a pink box.

The problem with feminism, nowadays, is not about promoting equality but all about trying to discriminate against men.

If not, some of us on here should look into joining forces and starting up one. Based on what I'm experiencing myself and reading in comments sections,  a merit-based STEM company would have a gaint competitive advantage this decade.

In a normal world you would not have to advertise you are a MERIT based company.

My ex-girlfriend will be referred to as her, she, etc.

About 6 years ago I was starting to put my life back together after being unemployed and sponging off of my parents for about 3 years. My sister helped me get a job, I bought two cars with plans to make project cars out of both of them, I moved out on my own, I had plans to move out of state and I was doing relatively well for myself. Soon, I became interested in a woman I worked with after she had started to show some interest in me. I was completely intoxicated by her presence and couldn't think straight around her, so when she told me she was looking to settle down and have a family with someone I stupidly told her that I would be happy to make a family with her. It wasn't really a lie at the time, I was just very lonely, smitten and had convinced myself that was what I wanted. We entered into an exclusive relationship shortly after and shortly after that I began to realize the mistake I made when I told her that I wanted a family with her. I had actually never wanted to have a family with anyone, ever. I told her that I had made a mistake and that I couldn't ever be a family man. I knew that I just didn't have the energy or drive to raise a family and be a financial provider. I remember her expression was extremely distant when I would tell her this and she would simply blow off what I said and change the subject.

After a few months of spending time with her I had become extremely exhausted. We both were working graveyard shift and didn't sleep much. At first it was fine, our relationship was new and exciting and we were just enjoying having fun together. After a while, this became a problem and started affecting my ability to work. I would ask her, almost on a daily basis, to let me get more sleep, but there was always something she wanted to do. There was always some kind of consequence for me to deal with if we didn't do what she wanted. She acted like a spoiled kid in a candy store and would never take no for an answer. I remember begging her to go home to her sister's so I could sleep. Eventually she promised that she would try to stop keeping me awake if I just let her stay with me, but not before it was too late.

Very shortly after moving into a new apartment I was fired from my job because my work performance had been so poor. This is when I began to understand how much trouble I was in with this woman. It was also when I realized that I didn't trust her. Because I didn't trust her, I knew that I could never be in a romantic relationship with her. I don't know if I accused her of cheating first or told her that I didn't want to be with her first, but I do know that this was around the time that the violence started. I know that the vast majority of the physical struggles we had happened when I would try to leave my apartment before things got out of hand during an argument and she would try to trap me there. I can't remember how many times I had to physically fight my way past her (while trying not to hurt her) to get out of my apartment. When I finally made it out of my apartment, if I did at all, I would try running down the street to get away from her and she would just chase me. There were times when I was able to get in my car, but when I would try to leave she would block my way. There was an instance when I had waited until she was using the bathroom to get out because I thought it would give me enough time to get to my car and drive away before she got to me. She simply chased me out of my apartment with nothing but a t-shirt on and then proceeded to scream at me and pound on my car window. There were a few times when I locked myself in the bathroom and she literally broke the door down.

During these fights she would pound on me with her fists and many times I would just stay fairly still and take it because I thought that as a man it could never bother me all that much. I never thought about the emotional damage the abuse was doing. Often times I would lay face down on my bed with my arms tucked under my chest and I would just try to ignore what was happening. It was some time before I started actually defending myself, mostly by trying to restrain her, eventually by pushing her away. Occasionally, sharp objects were held to my throat: knives, scissors, forks, whatever was handy. I did actually begin to worry that I might end up badly injured or dead, yet I was too stupid to do anything about it. I continued to tell her that I didn't want a relationship with her and she continued to respond with violence. There was a time when she explained to me that it wasn't up to me to determine if the relationship was over or not. I started falling into a deep depression.

The police were called on a regular basis and after a couple of calls they started taking her home to her sister's house. Very shortly after she would return to my apartment and threaten to kill herself until I let her back in. It was stupid letting her back in, I know, but I did care about her and didn't want her to hurt herself. I had struggled with thoughts of suicide myself years earlier and knew how painful it was to be alone while in that frame of mind. Soon the apartment management gave me a warning of eviction. The tenant below me had been using her phone to call the management company and leave messages which recorded the fights that were going on above her. When I went to the management office to talk to them about what was going on I remember hearing my voice on the recording repeatedly yelling, ""GO TO YOUR SISTER'S HOUSE! GO TO YOUR SISTER'S HOUSE! I DON'T WANT YOU HERE!"" I must have said that a hundred times during the course of those fights.

One night both of us were at her friend's house and I had left to walk home because I wanted to avoid a fight. She simply followed me, screaming at me, trying to get me to go back. At one point during this walk she punched me in the back of the head (a favorite spot of her's because it didn't leave visible marks), some police officers were talking in a parking lot and witnessed this. They came over and stopped us, then simply took her back to her friend's house. I was asked if I wanted to press charges. I didn't, mostly because I'm a moron, partly because I didn't want her to go to jail.

Eventually I was evicted from my apartment. I had nowhere to go, my parents weren't willing to let me stay with them while I got things sorted out because it would have been the second time returning to their house after living on my own. I had very little money, no job and no one to stay with. I gave up, I felt like I had no control and I became completely apathetic about everything. Then I asked this woman, who had done so much damage to my life, to move into a house with me.
Since meeting this woman, things had started to not feel real, everything just went on from one event to the next with me feeling like I was less and less a part of any of it. The abuse continued, but I had started to defend myself, I didn't look for a job because I felt like I wouldn't have been able to keep one with this woman in my life. I kept having sex with her, mostly to avoid the consequences (I remember she would insult my sexuality, calling me a faggot, etc.) that would ensue when she started to feel rejected. I felt like I was just going through the motions of life without having any power over what happened to me or any real awareness of it, like an animal living in a cage. This was me falling apart, this was me allowing the sickness of depression to take over, this was me beyond my limits.

Another time when she and I were at her friend's house, I got upset about something she said. Knowing that a fight would ensue if I confronted her about it, I decided to leave for home without telling her. In her eyes, that must have been the end of the world. As I attempted to get in my car, she grabbed me and tried to prevent me from doing so. After struggling for a while I was able to get in my car and sit down, but she had somehow wrapped her legs around mine while lying on the street. I was screaming at the top of my lungs for her to let me go and the police were called by the neighbors. When the police arrived, none of them asked what had happened, they simply pulled me out of my car (which would have been easy for them if she didn't still have a death grip on my legs), and as I was very passively being maneuvered out of my car, I was tossed around, yelled at and violently thrown against the hood of a car. I was charged with disorderly conduct and taken to jail because I was pleading for my own freedom. I had never been humiliated in such an overwhelming fashion by anyone other than her.

I was bailed out later that day. I had thought it was my father who bailed me out (I had been talking to him on the phone), but to my disappointment, it was her. Instead of waiting for my father to come pick me up, I stupidly got in the car with her. We were on our way to get my car out of the impound when we started arguing about what had happened. She was becoming violent so I got out of the car at the first opportunity and started walking. She caught up to me in the parking lot of a small business and then tried, several times, to hit me with her car. I went inside the building, where I saw a terrified employee huddled behind a desk, cradling a child and asked him to call the police. He had seen what happened in the parking lot and told me the police were already on their way. When the police arrived, they took statements and then laughed and joked about what had happened to me. Again, I was too stupid to press charges. She was allowed to go home, I waited to get a ride from my father. My unwillingness to take legal action against her was putting me deeper and deeper into a situation I could not recover from. I needed help to do the right thing and no one was there to help me.

Not long before I was arrested a condom broke and we later found out that she was pregnant. Despite all of the horrific problems we were having, she decided to go through with the pregnancy. If she hadn't been pregnant I think she would have finally moved on. She finally seemed to understand that she couldn't force me into a relationship that I didn't want. I was in denial that the child was mine, but for the sake of the child I tried my best to take care of her while she was pregnant. I brought her lunch at work, I went to birthing classes with her, I went to doctor visits with her, I fixed up a room in the house for the baby and I went shopping with her for things the baby would need. I had been regularly repairing her car and when it finally became too expensive to gain anything from, I added to a bank loan I already had so I could finish a project car for her to use. Soon after that I sold my other car to help pay bills. While she was pregnant I worked a couple of jobs, but had trouble concentrating on my work because of the depression I was in (I was constantly in a horrible mental fog) and I made mistakes, costly mistakes. I quit both jobs rather than deal with the consequences of those mistakes. I really was giving all that I could at the time, I simply couldn't manage to do a whole lot.

Over the next four years or so, I tried to make the best of the situation. I went back to school, but I had trouble with a few of the more time consuming classes. This was mostly because she made me feel like I wasn't her partner, but an employee of her’s and I wasn't measuring up. I tried to be affectionate and have fun with her, but she was beyond cold no matter what I did. I knew she felt nothing for me and I simply didn’t have enough drive to try to make her feel something for me. I guess I felt like I shouldn’t have had to try to rekindle our relationship. She was, after all, the one that had clung so tenaciously to it when I wanted it to end. She also seemed to actively try to make things difficult for me. Every time I voiced a need I had of her, she would ignore me, just like she did in the very beginning of our relationship when I begged her for sleep. As an example: a source of constant fighting was due to her allowing our son, at 2 years of age, to sleep in our bed every night. He would keep me awake all night long with constant movement (for some reason he always ended up kicking me in the face), so I was forced to sleep on an uncomfortable couch for months. This was after I had sold both of my cars, was spending an hour taking the bus and riding my bike to and from school, while taking a full-time class load and having to allow time for her school work as well. I simply couldn't do it.

I tried my best to make things right, but couldn't manage to be financially successful. Every part of my life and my relationship with my family suffered as a result. Not long after our son turned three she kicked me out and I severed all contact with my son and nearly all contact with her for about three months. After realizing how much I missed them and how important it was that I be with them, I went back home and explained my feelings. Shortly after that, she asked me to move back home. I tried improving myself in as many ways as I could, but it wasn't enough. I know now that nothing from me ever would have been enough for this woman. As far as I can tell, despite all she had done to me, she felt like I owed her a great deal. She felt like I owed her a life that I couldn't give her, she felt like I owed her something that I had told her I couldn't give her at the very beginning of our relationship: financial support.

They gave me some other bullshit reason for firing me but I was the most qualified person in the group - even more qualified than the female managers. 

The case took a turn for the worse because they opened a court case against me. Unfortunately our country is now run by a socialist government and elections will only be held in March. 

The main problem in issues such as mine is that WHOLE HR departments are populated by women. There is NOT A SINGLE MAN. I started seeing a therapist - a very nice lady - who understands very well the dynamics inside such workplaces. I chose a woman because I really do not care whether it is a man or a woman who helps me as I am not sexist. This therapist saw what was happening and is ready to help me fight a court case against the people who fired me.  I am amazed at how clearly she sees through the work place politics against men.

491,12tozam,2023-04-21,MensRights,"Woman assaults me in the testicles, and there are no consequences?","I’m posting here looking to see if anyone has any legal advice for me, because I’m pretty fed up with having been injured in the testicles by a woman being seen as funny and not being taken seriously.

tl;dr: Woman assaults me(male) with a groin attack unprovoked, police refuse to do anything, injuries sustained have caused me serious pain and impacted my life, lawyers don’t seem interested in offering me any counsel.

Background:

Last month while staying over at my girlfriend’s house and enjoying a bottle of wine together, she had me go to the kitchen for her to get a cup of ice. As I was doing that, her female roommate (who had been drinking vodka all evening with her boyfriend) stormed out into the kitchen. The roommate and my girlfriend were on bad terms and said roommate had apparently previously screamed at my girlfriend that same day. Roommate began drunkenly screaming in my face to “get the f%#+ out of her house.” I calmly told her that because I was a guest of my girlfriend (co-lease) she had no right to tell me to leave. Not wanting to be yelled at, I turned to go tell my girlfriend about it— but before I could walk away the roommate ran up behind me and kicked me between the legs as hard as she could.

After that, I called the police as an entire scene broke out with my girlfriend defending me and roommate and roommate’s boyfriend began screaming in her face. While I was still on the phone with dispatch, roommates boyfriend pushed my girlfriend and was looking over her like he was about to hit her. I pushed him away from her, and told dispatch I needed first responders. 

Within ten minutes two sheriffs deputies arrive and take our accounts, but weren’t interested in filing any police report— apparently because I’m a male calling them to report an assault by a female. In fact, they seemed more interested in possibly arresting *me* even though I’d done nothing criminal and was the one who had called them. I went to the sheriffs department the next day and had a sheriffs sergeant tell me, in essence, that I “should walk it off, at least it wasn’t a 6-foot Samoan man who had kicked (me).” Seeing the sexist attitude for what it was I asked him if I had done exactly what she had would I have been arrested? His answer, in plausible deniability fashion, was a condescending metaphor using my current job that “every situation is different and depends on the circumstances.” He refused to take a police report and to file a TRO.

After that, in excruciating pain and barely able to drive or walk, I went to Urgent Care and waited for 3 hours only to be told I needed to go to the ER. After having a CT scan and an ultrasound on my scrotum, they told me that luckily I didn’t appear to have a shattered testicle or any testicular torsion. However, I did have a varicocele, hydrocele and inflamed epididymus due to the assault. After this, I waited a few weeks using ice packs and was unable to work or maintain my daily activities, not to mention have any form of sexual activity because of the pain. I then got a referral to see a urologist who ordered another ultrasound, and I am waiting for his office to set up an appointment with him because currently I am still in pain over a month later. 

I’ve tried calling attorneys but no criminal attorneys will take my case because I don’t have the cooperation of the sheriffs department to file a report. Personal injury attorneys haven’t been interested either because they’d probably prefer to handle $100k car accident cases. I’m at a loss of what to do to get any justice here for my loss of income, medical costs, and pain and suffering. Meanwhile the woman who assaulted me has been doing everything in her power to fuck with my girlfriend and otherwise enjoying her life feeling free of any consequences (especially because her career as a WFH therapist would be over if she had been charged with any type of assault and battery, which would be for the best as she makes fun of her male clients and talks about their personal info).

Can anyone here advise me what I should do in these circumstances? I would truly appreciate some guidance.",Icy_Fan565,t2_9o3af14jw,0.95,160,65

The Advertising Standards Authority received a number of complaints about the Instant Finance ad, which featured a couple packing a donkey and cart for a trip away.

They began to argue and the woman raised her voice, before hitting the man.

**The complainants were concerned it showed a level of violence that would not be acceptable if the genders were reversed.**

Instant Finance changed the ad to remove the scene in question and the Advertising Standards Authority ruled the matter was settled.

Literally, advising people to hire women over men. It’s infuriating to me- it’s blatant sexism against me in a mainstream source, and it’s completely accepted.

Firstly, just imagine the reverse- this is purely sexist, it’s teaching people one gender is better than the other with broad generalizations.

Secondly, it’s harmful to men trying to get work, and men are *already* struggling more than women. This makes it even harder

Thirdly, the argument is completely illogical. Quoting from the article:

>What should you do if you’re in a position to influence hiring and promotion? Recognize that, objectively speaking, women at the same career position, work experience, and salary levels as men needed to work harder to get to where they are to overcome the gender discrimination stemming from the halo and horns effects. Thus, female candidates are likely to be substantially better workers than they appear on paper, in comparison to their male counterparts. And especially if you’re a man, you need to give women more credit than you feel they’re due to overcoming horns effect, while decreasing your evaluation of males due to halo effect.

But if you look at stats today, the opposite is true- it’s men who are disadvantaged in hiring, men who are behind in education, and men who are behind in the workforce..

The author goes on to say 

>Consequently — and without any reference to diversity and inclusion initiatives, simply for the sake of your bottom line — you should **always** give preference to women

(Emphasis mine) ALWAYS? So all women are better workers than all men? And businesses should basically just not hire men?


Here’s his last paragraph. It’s pure sexism:

>Seem counterintuitive? Perhaps a little unfair, especially if you’re a male? Well, I’m a man, and I can tell you that I would prefer to hire women over men, and recommend other males do the same. You’re simply doing what’s in the best interests of the organization. In fact, if you work in a publicly-traded company, you are obliged to serve the best interests of the shareholders. That means you need to go out of your way to promote, hire, mentor and include in networks those people who are most likely to serve the best interests of your company. Those people are women, this stands apart from any diversity issues. Doing so will create the biggest profit.",Valacos,t2_5vzsuopm,0.98,51,22
496,18tmbgs,2023-12-29,MensRights,“Being a leader is harder for women because they don’t get the same respect as men…”,"The alleged disrespect most female leaders get is often used as an excuse for them acting rude to their subordinates. They often say things like, “to be a woman in power you have to be mean to demand respect.” But apparently this is unnecessary. I find this [article](https://www.apa.org/topics/women-girls/female-leaders-make-work-better#:~:text=Decades%20of%20studies%20show%20women,companies%20are%20led%20by%20women) interesting because it provides studies that actually discredits the common myth that people, in particular men, don’t respect or value female leaders as much as male ones. It shows that people, men and women included, see women leaders as “equally or more competent as men.” And more honest, compassionate, and intelligent then their male counterparts. And that most people actually prefer both men and women to take the role of leaders in organizations. 

While I believe that qualified women should not be barred from leadership positions. And it may be unfortunately true in some contexts that people are less respectful of a leader simply because she’s a woman. This, however, is not the norm, so there is no need to mistreat others by default, or to be needlessly rude to demand respect from others. Being unkind can have negative [consequences](https://www.hrmonline.com.au/culture/rudeness-in-the-workplace/) in the workplace and is counterproductive to creating a positive and productive work environment. [Studies](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~memccullough/Papers/2017-Cooperation-Roles%20of%20Interpersonal%20Value%20and%20Gratitude.pdf) have shown that people are more likely to respect and admire those who are pleasant and kind to be around. [Additionally](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/37/3/673.full.pdf), being confident and assertive, while also maintaining respect for others, can also earn the respect of others in return. Being in a position of power, regardless of gender, does not require one to be cruel, maybe “tough,” “firm,” and “no-nonsense,” but not cruel.

I'm a feminist. I know some of you will stop reading there and the downvote brigade will charge in, but I wanted to make this post here anyway.

As a woman, I don't believe in just women having so called 'equal rights'. Nor do I believe that men are as privileged as many 'feminists' say they are. Truth is that most 'feminists' don't want women and men to be equal. No, they want women to be superior to men, to people who are gender neutral or just outside of the binary. These 'feminists' disgust me. It's all very well for them to go on and on about 'slutshaming' and 'body positivity', but they forget that when they malign men, that they are also being bigoted and sexist themselves.

There is a notion put forward by these so called 'feminists'. That notion is that most men are evil/will do bad things/are sexist at heart/consider women to be lesser beings than them. Oh, and God forbid the men who try to campaign for their equal rights! I'll give you a little example of this 'feminism' in action:
>A woman sleeps with five hundred men in five years. In modern 'feminism' she is heralded as a hero, with cries of, 'You go girl!' and 'It's your body! Props to you!' all around. She is thought of as being strong and respected for choosing what is still a taboo choice.

>A man sleeps with five hundred women in five years. In modern 'feminism', he is thought of as being a womaniser. 'Feminists' will decry his actions and say that he is disgusting and imply that he must have taken advantage of those poor, poor, consenting, of age women.

Another example for you:

>A woman takes it upon herself to become a mechanic. The 'feminists' rejoice and say, 'What a noble choice, going into a field full of men and bigotry!'.

>A man decides that he would like to own a store selling cupcakes, as he enjoys baking and is artistically skilled. 'Feminists' laugh and say, 'Shouldn't you do something more... 'Manly'? You have advantages in business, go and run a company.'

I'm sure, being a men's rights group, you all already know this. I'm sure, also, that you have encountered this bigotry and sexism. I'm here to apologise on behalf of the men and women who call themselves 'feminists'. They preach that they want positive change and that they want equality for all, when in reality they just want women to become a super power and for all men to bow down and kiss their feet. Has sexism and misogyny existed for millions of years? Of course. Does modern 'feminism' perpetuate sexism against men and misandry? Oh, they certainly do.

From what I have read here after lurking around for a month or so, I can safely say that while you at MR seem level headed and reasonable, the 'feminist' /r/'s I've seen are almost militant in their behaviour. They will regularly invade reasonable conversations about men's rights and decry them as being oppressive and backwards, which is something abhorrent to me. Of course, because they are 'feminists', they are allowed to get away with it. God forbid anyone hurts the feelings of a white, non-poverty stricken American female, and God forbid anyone tells her that she won't be getting a raise or that shiny bonus this year because she didn't work as hard as her male counterpart!

Don't get me wrong. I actually consider myself a feminist. However, while I believe that women are discriminated against, I am not so blinkered as to see that men are subject to just as much bigotry. I have heard first hand, from male friends, the misandry they encounter day to day from women, other men and, well, everyone! Men are wrongly maligned as being some kind of different breed - an animalistic one which doesn't know how to control impulses - by much of the world. While 'feminism' is rampant, men are being left behind and are discriminated against more than ever.

This has gone off on something of a tangent, but I wanted to post this here just to show you guys that some of us women empathise with you and don't see you as bigoted for standing up for what you believe in and what you rightfully deserve. Ironically, had I posted this in a 'feminist' subreddit, I would have been accused of all sorts and asked if I'd been abused or oppressed by men. Funny how these 'feminists' work, isn't it?

This was in India where I had a business. But I am a foreigner.

A French guy I knew recommended I hire a girl he knew. In retrospect, he was probably trying to scrape her off. She was Anglo-Indian, very beautiful, part of a community that had mostly moved abroad. I dated her for a while. 

She accused a guy who worked for me of sexual assault. I was blue pilled at that time and stupidly believed her. It turned out she was known as a false accuser at police stations all over the city. When she had used up one cop shop for attention she moved onto another. 

She had been screwing the accused guy and wanted to marry him. The guys family were actually quite accepting. She was ""very aged"", in her mid 20s, and had a kid already. But she was nuts. On one occasion she started hitting him in public. He had to take it. If you raise a hand to a woman in a place like this you get jumped by a hundred white knights. When he wanted to break off the relationship she accused him of sexual assault and had him jailed. 

When all of this came out I fired her very attractive ass. She used bad language which would make a sailor blush. I had security escort her out. At the door she started punching herself in the face and asking me, who was standing 20 feet away, why I was hitting her. I guess this was a routine she went through.

He IS TRAPPED and has been for a while, he faces defamation from his ex, in the years I have known him, he has been stalked by her, harassed by her, his friends get harassed by her (including me), and also his oldest son (which is her stepson in relation) was abused by her while he was growing up (by her being jealous I think?), but he is too scared to do anything about her because she's good at swaying people to her side. 

She is manipulative, she does these little things that are inconspicuous, enough that it makes you uncomfortable, but it’s not enough that you can’t do much about because it feels ridiculous to fight legally.

She follows the patterns of a cycle abuser, meaning she goes from harassing him and being abusive in a few different ways, then moves to love bombing him and treating him like he's her best friend and could be/should be lover again. He is scared to fight for himself, so he just takes the hits and suffers the marks she puts on his records in the legal system. When they have an argument face to face, she can and sometimes will get violent, but then files a claim with police saying that he hits her, so she can be the victim and not him. 

I used to be his witness for a lot of things and come with him to children exchanges and children doctor appointments, but I had so much anxiety every time because the harassment messages I got, and eventually she went around trying to smear my name, told people (their kids schools and doctors offices) that I harass her and there is a restraining order being worked on to protect her from me. I even had police show up at my door because she called them to investigate something on me—nothing happened.

At one point (in 2018), he was able to get a recording of her strangling him, and charges were pressed on her over it. In retaliation after this incident, she tried to file a counter police report saying he hit her in hopes to get him in trouble instead of her, but her report got dropped because police could see what she was doing. 

Currently the situation is this:
They are still married, but live separately. He has been trying to fully divorce her off and on (money reasons/unable to keep paying lawyers) since 2016, but officially the filing process started in 2018. 

He has her blocked and won't communicate with her because she filed a fake assault claim on him last year and therefore a PO is in place. 

I’ve been a witness for him with things again since Jan 2023 and every time she has parent time with kids, they get sent home with gifts to give him. It’s silly things like meals from a restaurant she picked up on the way to dropping the kids off, cookies, but another time she did have the kids give him a baggie of weed… but this goes back to they cycle abuse pattern, let’s retaliate to control him and file a police report after an argument going how I didn’t like, but now I am going to shower him with food/gifts to get him back or to be my friend again.",lucilleball88,t2_42nk5753,0.92,62,48

She likes to sell herself as someone you can talk with her about anything, and she even told me she gets along with guys better and has no female friends (red flag much?). She's fairly attractive, but I've never complimented her in that way or made any kind of advance at her, as I'm generally distrustful of women in the workplace that they will misconstrue a simple compliment.

Yesterday I emailed a joke to her that seemed innocuous; I joke around with anyone I think I'm cool with, but this joke was somehow interpreted as sexist. I won't get into the details as it's an inside joke, but she basically emailed me back saying ""This office needs an education on sexism...""

Honestly, I'm not sure what's going to come of this, whether it just blows over or ends up being a discussion with HR, or worse.

So, I have about ten years in management roles, and I've noticed that as mainstream media increasingly questions the Patriarchy and writes about how to reduce toxic masculinity and micro-aggressions and mansplaining, etc, the number increases of mainly female staff who think it is acceptable just to say they're not comfortable talking to me so as to not have to have a conversation about improving their performance.

I start with gentle comments, etc, but if a problem persists, I try to sit down with the person to see if we can work things out informally (listening to them as well, etc). Most people can go this far, especially men (just saying). But a few people just walk off while saying, ""Look, I'm not prepared to talk about this because I'm not comfortable"" as if that's some sort of legal escape clause.

Now, I want to emphasise I've been doing this for years and I have management training, so I don't need general tips on how to motivate staff or on how to follow procedures on what to do next (touched on further down, anyway). Anything you can say about this is just likely the steps I follow or consider without going into them here. My specific problem is I believe I am seen as the identity-class bully (the Patriarchy), even though I was always the last person ever to bully anyone (often defending victims and mediating with bullies), and what it means is I'm the one who's really being bullied. I'm even having nightmares, it's that bad. 

Let me continue: It's anyway something like 99% soft skills, this leading people business. Encouraging, facilitating, empowering - all that. However, if someone's really going too far, then according to imployment guidelines in my area (New Zealand), staff don't actually have a right not to be uncomfortable with a manager if it concerns legitimate work. (We're not talking about sexual harassment or religious discrimination, etc.) We do need to take reasonable care, though, to ensure they are not made to feel ""unduly uncomfortable."" However, it's not like it won't take eons to get them to understand the intracacies around all of this, to the point it's hardly worth trying. 

So, one lady went into a rage with me because I wanted to resolve an ambiguity and misunderstanding around her attending meetings. I'd given her the choice of talking about it now or in the next few days, but insisted we needed to talk it through, so she chose now and flew off her handle without giving me a chance. Perhaps out of an interest in self-preservation, she then filed a complaint that I had bullied her. I am a senior manager, but only of my region. There are ""more senior"" managers within the company. They didn't care that in NZ, workplace bullying is defined as, among other things, ""not a one of instance, such as an argument"", and ""not your manager wanting to talk to you about your performance"". It just went on my record as a bullying accusation, which was investigated accordingly. She later ""moderated"" that side of her statement, but the fallout meant my mandate to lead was reduced rather than reinforced.

Recently, another woman was on the warpath, saying things around the office such as: ""None of you need to attend staff meetings. Don't accept management's offer of a $50 petrol reimbursement. If you increase my output from six units to seven [others average 12 and go up to 16], I will go home and set my [employment] contract on fire."" I needed to talk to her. I offered twice. She declined. I sent an assistant manager to talk to her, and he kept a record she was agreeable and promised to change. She didn't. I invited her to a formal talk with a support person. She declined, and told me to do some more shopping for her work resources. I sent another formal invitation with the caution that if she declined again, she would receive a formal warning. She wrote to my assistant manager that she thought she might resign. He advised her not to and asked her to attend - he would be there too. She showed up, said her piece, and threw over a typed and signed resignation. I later accepted it. My assistant manager wrote to endorse our processes and how fair and calm I had been. (He's gay, so not everyone is against me as a straight white male - only the far-left, collectivist, neo-Marxists.) 

The CEO and his deputy have given me absolute hell, despite all the documentation I maintained to show how unreasonable she had been and how I had followed employment guidelines at every step, as well as my management team endorsing me 100%. The upshot is I have been forced to sign a document saying staff don't need to talk to me if they're simply uncomfortable. That's a complete denial of probably the most fundamental right of a manager. If your staff won't talk to you, they're not working with you. Employment guidelines state that the most common form of the bullying of a manager (since it can go both ways), is refusing to cooperate and communicate. And yet this is now enabled by the CEO. It is bullying by proxy. The deputy told this woman in front of me that if she would rescind her resignation, she would no longer need to report to me. I emailed my concerns that this would be an emotionally abusive act and my and my assistant managers' psychological wellbeing was also at stake. 

I have three staff in particular who are volatile (aside from the one who went into a rage, accused me of bullying, but tries to be nice to me now). One guy, who other managers warn is manipulative and feuds, keeps writing complaints about my character to the CEO after I stopped pandering to him. One woman who is old enough to retire occasionally flies off onto a rage, throwing things and swearing her head off (not at me - it's not all at me - but I anticipate it can happen at any time). Another lady cannot look at men without thinking there is something sexual going on. Both my assistant managers have noticed it, even my gay manager, and both have expressed how this concerns them. One male staff member, I am fairly sure, resigned to get away from her and the risk of accusations she represents (the rumours about something between them had become rife). She even wanted a customer removed from her account because he had cried once (he is a refugee from Palistine) and another time his sister had smiled at him and then he had smiled at this woman, so she thinks he's in love with her. 

These are three very concerning people, and I am now powerless to hold them increasingly to account unless they agree to say they're comfortable at every step - a feuder, a woman who rages, and a woman who sees men as sexual predators. Many of these issues are inherited, as I only came in 10 months ago, and I was warned about each of these individuals. I hold a lot of responsibilities and accordingly I am accountable, even to the law in extreme cases. But I have been denied commensurate authority to lead. 

I believe it is because of an increasing trend where too many people think their right not to be abused includes not being uncomfortable when discussing their performance or attitude at work with their boss. 

Of course I'm wondering about resigning or hiring a lawyer. (NZ legal proceedings are expensive, and there is no hope of a huge payout, all you tend to get is a little more job security.)

\- no touching besides introductory handshakes

\- I NEVER comment on their looks, this applies for both positive and negative comments. I don't even do it when they are not around.

\- I never talk about dating or sex with/around them.

There, its that simple. I followed these rules since I started working and had 0 problems or complaints so far.

In my eyes the not following these rules is a risk not worth taking, especially for unattractive guys like myself.

I've heard my female coworkers calling guys creeps for merely attempting what I would judge to be ""corporate friendly"" and politically correct flirting. It only takes one willing to escalate things beyond gossip to ruin your livelihood.

1. From an early age the opposite sex will be instructed never to hit me but I may not be given the same instructions. However, should I strike males I can expect not to be hit back and any social penalties that occur from my actions will actually fall on the male.

2. If I’m not smart, but pretty, I can marry and achieve the social and financial level of my husband without ever working.

3. I can produce offspring. A status which grants me an “essential” status in our species that men can never have and which can never be taken away from me even in old age.

4. Regardless of my mate value society has organized fertility clinics and social welfare programs that will allow me to have children and provide for them should I choose to reproduce without a mate or marriage.

5. I not only have the more valuable and sought after sexual identity, but I also have complete control over my reproductive choice and in many ways over the reproductive choice of the opposite sex.

6. At any time I can abandon my parental responsibilities with little or no social stigma and hand the child over to the state or abort the pregnancy. A male could never relieve himself of this burden unless I allow him to.

7. I am granted all the rights of a democracy without any of the burdens of military service.

8. At age 18 I lose the protective status of the child but retain the protective status of the female. Boys at age 18 lose the protected status of the child and become targets if they fail to gain status after that point.

9. When I marry a man with status I can take his name and become whoever he has spent years becoming. I need not do anything special to be worthy of receiving the reputation he has built. However, if I wish to keep my own name I can do so. Should my husband feel the sting of this insult I can simply call him a sexist for it.

10. People will help me more when I’m in need and I will receive no social penalty or stigma for it.

11. When I’m on a date things will be paid for me.

12. When I search for employment I can choose jobs which I think are fulfilling without concern of whether they provide a “family” wage.

13. I can discriminate against the opposite sex ruthlessly without social penalty.

14. If I marry and quit my job and enjoy a leisurely life with light housework and then later divorce I will be given half of the marital assets.

15. If I commit a crime and am convicted I will get a sentencing “discount” because of my gender. If I am very pretty it will increase my discount.

16. If I am a partner in crime with a man I will likely be charged with lesser crimes even though I committed the same crimes even if I was the ringleader.

17. I have the option to be outraged if my husband asks me if my behavior is due to PMS and later on use PMS as a successful legal defense for murdering that same husband.

18. At age 18 I will not be forced to register for Selective Service and will not be penalized for failing to do so.

19. At a time of war I will never be drafted and ripped from my employment, home, and family and forced to become a military slave.

20. My feelings are more important than men’s lives. Every precaution will be made to protect me from harassment at work. However, males will make up nearly %100 of workplace fatalities.

21. My gender controls 80% of domestic spending. We get to spend our money if we have any and we get to spend men’s money.

*Slow clap* 

22. The majority of luxury apparel is designed, marketed to, and consumed by women.

23. Seven times as much jewelry will be purchased by or for me than by or for men.

24. I have a department of women’s health whereas men have no such department.

25. My gender enjoys more government spending on health than males do.

26. My gender consumes the lioness’ share of entitlement programs while men contribute the lion’s share of taxes.

27. If I rape or molest a child I can expect lighter treatment in court and afterwards receive less social stigma. What’s more, should I become pregnant, I can sue my victim for child support when he finally turns 18.

28. When I divorce my husband I will be guaranteed custody of my children unless I am deemed to be unfit. Even if my husband is “Parent of the Year” 10 years running it is unlikely he will get custody over me even if I am a mediocre parent.

29. When I divorce I can use false accusations of domestic violence, sexual molestation of the children or abuse of the children to gain advantage during court proceedings. If I am found out to be a liar I can expect to get away with it.

30. If a man calls me a slut it will probably hurt his reputation more than it hurts mine, but at any rate the damage will be small and localized. However, if I call him a child molester or claim that he raped me I can destroy him completely and the damage may be nationwide.

31. If I fail at my career I can blame the male dominated society.

32. I may have the luxury of staying home and being a housewife but if my sister’s husband does the same thing I’m likely to call him a deadbeat loser and tell her to leave him.

33. If I “choose” to join the military; the best military occupations providing the most lucrative civilian training will be reserved for me. I will be kept away from the fighting as much as possible to the point that I will be thirty times less likely to be killed in a war zone than my male counterparts. I will be given equal pay for less risk. I will never have to consider the fact that by joining the military and getting a plumb assignment I automatically forced a male out of that position and into a combat role that may cost him his life.

34. If a male soldier injures himself before a deployment he can be arrested and court marshaled for it. If I deliberately get pregnant before a deployment or even during a deployment I will be reassigned and or taken out of a war zone and I will receive no penalty for it.

35. My gender watches more television in every hour of every day than any other group. This along with the fact that women control %80 of domestic spending means that most television shows and advertisement are designed to appeal to me.

36. I can wear masculine clothing if it pleases me however men cannot wear feminine clothing without social penalty.

37. Not only is there a wealth of clothing choices designed for me but it is likely that I will be able to afford or have them provided for me.

38. I can claim that a wage gap exists and that it is the fault of sexism while simultaneously seeking employment without considering income as a priority. I will probably choose my job based on satisfaction, flexibility of hours, and working conditions and then expect to make as much as the males working nights, out in the rain and cold or working overtime.

39. I can be bigoted or sexist against males without social penalty.

40. If I make a false claim of rape against a male in an act of revenge or in order to cover up my own scandalous behavior I may well succeed at both and he may spend years in prison. If I am found out it is unlikely I will be charged, convicted, or serve any time at all.

41. If I abuse my husband and physically assault him and the police arrive it is almost guaranteed he will go to jail.

42. If I am in an abusive relationship there are a multitude of social organizations to help me get away from him. There are few for men in the same position even though women initiate the majority of DV and even though men are hospitalized %30 of the time.

43. In the event of a natural disaster or other emergency that requires evacuation I can expect to be evacuated before males. This includes male doctors, humanitarians, politicians, captains of industry, billionaires, and religious leaders. I will receive no social penalty if all of those people died because I was evacuated first. However, should they manage to get evacuated before women and those women died they will all suffer a social penalty.

44. If someone is attacking a person on the street I have no obligation to assist them and I will receive no social penalty if I do nothing.

45. If someone is harming my children and I run away and ask someone else to help I will receive no social penalty for my cowardice.

46. I’m immune to cognitive dissonance.

*Clapping intensifies* 

47. I may denounce the concept of a dowry, however, I still expect a man to give me an engagement ring when he asks me to marry him.

48. I expect a man to ask me to marry me and suffer the potential risk of rejection.

49. If I lie it’s because I’m a victim of a male dominated society forced into difficult circumstances and not because I’m a bad person.

50. If my boyfriend sabotages a condom he can pay me child support for the next 20 years. If I secretly don’t take my birth control my boyfriend can pay me child support for the next 20 years.

51. If I’m uncomfortable exercising around men I can demand a female only gym be made for women. If any male only gyms exist I can demand membership under threat of lawsuit.

52. If my female only gym at the university decides to close early for safety reasons I can scream sexism and force them to keep it open as long as the main gym.

53. If I succeed at keeping the female gym open and I leave late at night and I don’t feel safe I can demand that the university spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for more lighting and police presence.

54. If after getting new lighting and police protection I decide I don’t want to go to the gym anymore well that’s just my prerogative.

55. I’m likely to believe that if a woman is intoxicated she is not capable of giving consent and if sex occurs it is rape. However, if her male partner is also intoxicated he is capable of consenting.

56. If a man is promoted over me at work I have a right to suspect sexism even though I also believe that under adverse circumstances men are more capable than women of making good decisions. (see #55)

57. I can cry and get my husband to do something for me that he might not have done otherwise.

58. I expect people (especially men) to be sensitive to my feelings.

59. I can deny a man’s feelings or disregard them or ridicule him for having them without social penalty.

60. If I lose my job it’s because of sexism or the economy. If a man loses his job it’s because he’s a loser.

61. If I go to a club or bar with my girlfriends and I look my sexy best I have a right to be perturbed when men approach me and hit on me in this public place.

62. Even though men die more from prostate cancer than women die from breast cancer I can expect that twice as much funding is given for breast cancer. The same will apply to any female specific disease or malady.

63. If for some reason I do not get custody of my children I will be expected to pay less child support than another man in my exact same position.

64. If I kidnap my children and I am eventually caught I can successfully defend myself by claiming I was protecting them from my husband–even if my children were given to him to protect them from me.

65. My gender makes up %53 of the voting population yet when I see more men in political office I will call that sexism.

66. If I am married with children and I want to stay home with the kids I’m likely to blame my husband for not making enough to allow me to do that.

67. I think it is my right to work and I am unconcerned if the influx of women into the workforce has reduced overall wages to the point that it’s hard to support a family on just one income, or affirmative action has kept men from being promoted even though they deserved it.

68. I can get student financial aid without signing up for Selective Service (the Draft).

69. I can get employment with a federal agency without signing up for Selective Service.

*clapping so fast my hands are experiencing rope burn* 

70. Restrooms for my gender will be cleaner and are more likely to have flowers or other decorations.

71. If I’m caring for a child restrooms for my gender will more likely have a changing table for my convenience.

72. People I’ve never met before are more likely to open doors for me.

73. People I’ve never met before are more likely to talk to me in public.

74. If I go to a bar I can expect that members of the opposite sex will purchase drinks for me.

75. Anytime I find an organization just for men I can denounce it as sexism.

76. I believe that women should have organizations just for women.

77. If I meet a man that I like and I give him my phone number and he doesn’t call I have a right to think of him as an asshole.

78. If I meet a man that I like and I give him my phone number and he calls me I have a right to blow him off or act like I don’t know him.

79. I believe I have a right to live in an orderly and safe society but I feel no obligation to risk my safety to secure or maintain that society.

80. I like it when bars and clubs have drinks specials just for women.

81. I think that organizations that offer any discounts or privileges just for men is a clear sign of sexism.

82. If I’m white I will live 6 years longer than white males and 14 years longer than black males.

83. If I’m encouraged to get medical care it’s because I owe it to myself.

84. When my husband is encouraged to get medical help it’s because he owes to to me and the kids.

85. If something bad happens to me or just one woman I believe it is an offense against all women.

86. I believe that if something bad happens to a man it’s because he’s a loser.

87. I think that alimony is fair when paid to a woman but not fair when paid by a woman.

88. I’m more likely to believe that women who commit crimes are sick and need treatment or understanding whereas men who commit crimes are evil and should be locked up forever.

89. I can criticize the opposite sex without social penalty, but woe be to the man who attempts to criticize me or other women.

90. I can throw a fit and act like a two year old to get what I want without damaging my mate value.

91. I have the luxury of not being the filter for natural selection.

92. I can sleep with my boss if I want and afterwards I can sue him for sexual harassment.

93. I can wear seductive clothing and perfume to attract a man at work but no one will accuse me of sexual harassment.

94. If I hear a story about Darfur and how men who leave the refugee camps to gather wood are hacked to death to prevent their wives from being raped I am likely to think that is proper but not likely to send money.

95. If I hear a story about Darfur and how women are leaving the refugee camps to gather wood are being raped I’m likely to be outraged. I’m also likely to wonder why these women’s husbands aren’t protecting them.

96. If I ever heard these stories about Darfur it is my privilege not to care or even consider that the reason the second story exists is because all the men in the first have already been killed.

97. It is my right to maintain the belief that men oppress women despite all of the evidence to the contrary.

Consider filing a complaint about about a psychologist who you feel is not behaving appropriately, and getting a different psychologist:

> Complaints Regarding APA Members

> If you have a complaint against a psychologist, you should contact your local, state, provincial or territorial psychology licensing board to determine if the psychologist is licensed and obtain information on filing a complaint with that licensing board. These state regulatory agencies control the ability of a psychologist to practice and are separate entities from APA. A complete list can be found at The Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards.

Her and her daughter left and that was the end of it. 

I just can't imagine being so entitled that someone not allowing me to cut in front of them makes me feel like I've been wronged in some way. And not only that, but thinking it means that chivalry is dead!

523,hyddl,2011-06-13,MensRights,"MensRights, I'm back in school to be a nurse, and was confronted by this shit today","Now normally I face literally zero discrimination of any sort in nursing school and the affiliated organizations, if anything I get preferential treatment due to the fact that I'm a male. But today was a different story. 

I recently joined a sort of bonus program offered by the nursing college that allows us to get a little extra experience by joining a group that goes to the local hospital and shadows nurses doing their daily routine. I'm the only male in the group, and before this had never been a problem. Today we were going to the birthing suits to shadow the OB nurses there. Now I got to watch ultrasounds, infant care, etc no problems, but while we were there a mother went into labor and consented to us observing the child being born.

We're about to go into the room when one of our ""tour guides"", for lack of a better term, pulls me aside and says ""I think you should sit this one out, the mother might be uncomfortable with a man in the room viewing this."" I was floored by this. I pretty much assumed that when the mother in question consented they told her that there was a male student there as well. I responded with ""Well do you mind if I at least ASK the woman if I can come in? I'd rather not miss something like this."" To which she replied ""Listen, you'll be going over this when you're in training, I think it's best if you stay outside, this sort of thing requires a more feminine touch.""

At this point it's all I can do to stop from yelling at this woman. I told her, as calmly as I could, that would inform her supervisors if she didn't at least let me ask if the mother would permit me to view the birth. She visibly pissed at this but let me go in and ask, and the mother told me she was perfectly fine with me being in there (her actual words were ""Hell, bring a camera if you want,"" which calmed me down a bit). After we finished for the day I called the programs administration office and filed the complaint anyway. I also took the liberty of warning the few other male nursing students I know to watch out for the lady.

I can honestly say that this was the first time in my life I've ever felt discrimination on anything, let alone because of the fact that some of my organs dangle. I just kept asking myself if it would get worse than this. It may sound mild but I was extremely offended by this and I felt it necessary to share.

EDIT: A couple people have mentioned that the mother was in a somewhat unfit state to be making a judgement about whether or not I should have been in the room. I'd just like to inform you that this woman was doing a crossword up until the doctor came in and told her she was in labor. Pain drugs work wonders these days.",Bubbascrub,t2_4v1c8,0.93,865,331

527,11kfc1n,2023-03-06,MensRights,Feminists Only Seek Leadership Positions,"""There is a lack of female workers in \_\_\_ field"" the field is 100% of the time based on not only a non-physical labor job but also a leadership position. 

Mainly because: **(A)** Feminists seek leverage over men and **(B)** Because they think leadership is not a masculine trait. 

To be fair leadership is not a male only trait but IS a masculine trait meaning a woman with strong leadership skills is far less likely to also be a feminine woman. Look at Angela Merkel for example, not the peak example of femininity now is it? 

Which also means all the divas in leadership positions are there just for the trophy and likely were put in there by men to begin with because..they are women, they're pretty or something. I am an office worker I have no problem working with women if they deserve to be in the spot.

But the main problem with this feminist movement about workplace equality in numbers is that it is very position-biased, **regardless** of a job's payment, the women will rather be bosses for 1k a month than workers for 2k a month, even tho ""women are just as physically capable as men"" clown ass statements still dare to leave their mouths.

531,134yvsg,2023-05-01,MensRights,The 'gender pay gap' is a myth. It should be called the 'gender earnings gap'.,"The so-called ‘gender pay gap’ is one of the central tenets of feminist doctrine. Of course, in one sense, it is a fact. Estimates vary, but on average, women will earn about 75-85% of what men earn over their lifetimes. We might more accurately refer to this as a gender earnings gap than a gender pay gap, but whatever you call it, I won’t argue. It seems pretty clear to me, and I don’t doubt the statistics. The question is whether or not it matters. If one can reasonably extrapolate from those figures that women earn less than men purely because of workplace discrimination, then that’s an issue. But the correlation between gender and lifetime earnings is nowhere near as simple a picture as feminists make out.

The idea most frequently conflated with the gender earnings gap is that of unequal pay. The notion that women are paid less than men for doing the same work is often—implicitly or explicitly—touted as the reason women earn less. But paying one gender less than the other for the same job is illegal, and it has been for over fifty years. Indeed, if it were possible to pay women less than men for the same work, one would expect businesses to reduce their labour costs by employing more women. But that’s the opposite of what happens. 

On average, even the women who work 'full time' work far fewer hours than men, and this is just one of the many reasons they may earn less over a lifetime. They also choose different careers from men, are less likely to do dangerous jobs or relocate for a higher salary, and tend to prioritise other things, like children and family. None of this has anything to do with the relative amounts men and women might be paid for doing the same work. The difference between equal pay and the gender pay gap is important and seems straightforward enough, but the deliberate conflation of the two concepts is ongoing, and many feminists are desperate to keep it alive.

Take the Fawcett Society’s ‘Equal Pay Day’. This is described as “a national campaign led by Fawcett Society in the UK. It marks the day where women effectively on average, stop earning relative to men because of the gender pay gap.” In the US, the Whitehouse itself is in on the act, which it does to highlight “how far into a new year a woman must work, on average, to earn what a man did in the previous year.” In 2023, it was March 14th. The justification for this is that “women working full-time, year-round are paid an average 84 cents for every dollar paid to men.” 

The implication is that throughout the workforce, and with consistent and predictable regularity, employers are breaking the law by paying women 84% of what they pay men for the same work. But is that really what’s happening? How could such a flagrant disregard for employment legislation be taking place on such an enormous scale, and all through the relatively quantifiable, traceable conduits of taxable salary payments? The answer is that it’s not. Women are not being paid 84% of what men get paid for the same work. They can’t be, because they’re not doing the same work. 

Amongst the top female-dominated jobs in the US and the UK are nursing, childcare, and secretarial work; amongst the top male-dominated jobs are construction, plumbing, and vehicle maintenance. In the US, the annual mean wage for all occupations is $58,260. Out of the top ten female-dominated professions, all but three pay an annual mean wage which is lower than that, and the annual mean wage for the top ten female-dominated professions combined ($50,581) is almost ten thousand dollars lower than the national mean. On the other hand, five of the top ten male-dominated fields pay higher than the overall mean, and the average for the top ten male-dominated jobs comes in at $59,643, or in other words, $1,383 higher than the overall average.

The average annual pay in the UK is £31,285. Again, only three of the top ten female-dominated professions pay more than that, compared to five of the top ten male-dominated professions. The top ten female-dominated professions in the UK pay an average of £26,925 for 35 hours of work; the top ten male-dominated professions pay an average of £30,451 for 48 hours of work. The Fawcett Society takes care not to highlight facts like this on Equal Pay Day, but it’s worth noting that in the UK, not only are men working longer hours, they are actually getting paid a *lower* average hourly rate than their female counterparts.

So what does all that tell us? Men and women pick their careers with some predictability along gender lines. Men work longer hours and get paid more overall, although their hourly rates aren’t always better. They also do some of the more dirty, dangerous jobs that women don’t like. Similarly, women tend to do things men don’t like. These jobs often require fewer working hours and offer more flexibility. That’s hardly a fashionable thing to say, and I am by no means advocating for adherence to traditional gender roles, but the statistics reflect a freely exercised choice, and remain true whether you like them or not. 

This element of choice is crucial when discussing the gender earnings gap with any nuance. Another key element is age. When you bring age into the equation, you realise how much of a blunt instrument those much-touted ‘gender pay gap’ statistics are. Longitudinal studies tracking the trajectories of professional men’s and women’s careers over time have shown a negligible earnings gap for the first ten years after university. Around ten years in—which coincides with the time most graduates start having families—a divergence between average male and female earnings starts to set in. Feminists waste no time in concluding that this is due to sexism. But could it be that women at that stage in their careers just have different priorities in life?

In a recent Yale study of management-track employees from a large retail chain, researchers lamented the failure of higher-ups to promote female employees. In their abstract, the study's authors rush to conclude that this is due to hiring managers' inability to recognise women's leadership potential. Yet the researchers also found that female employees were less likely to accept promotions when they were offered, citing longer hours, less flexible working patterns, and potential relocation as barriers to acceptance. Indeed, when isolating promotions requiring relocation, the ‘gender promotion gap’ was significantly more pronounced. The researchers’ data also showed that men were more likely to leave the firm to look for promotion elsewhere if they were passed over internally. In other words, more men than women were prepared to secure a higher salary by committing to work longer hours, enjoy less flexibility, and undergo the upheaval of leaving the company or moving home. 

It may reasonably be deduced that not only do women tend to choose different careers from men, but they may also exercise greater freedom of choice when navigating those careers. Should work and family issue competing claims for their attention, they at least have the option of picking between the two. The element of female choice is often missing from the gender earnings gap debate, presumably because it might make the gap look like a good thing for women.

Another frequently absent point of discussion is the financial pressure upon men starting a family. Whilst it is perfectly obvious why a new mother might want to work less, it is equally logical, although less commonly talked about, that a new father might feel he needs to work *more*. The financial anxiety that comes with children can be terrifying for men, not least in a society where high-earning careers are touted as a birth right attendant upon ‘male privilege’. However, when men do pursue advancements in seniority and salary, their actions are often attributed to an ugly desire for power and domination. 

Yet the average man is not an individual economic entity; he exists as part of a household structure which commonly includes a woman, and she benefits as much as he does from any advancements in his career. This particular elephant in the room is often ignored, but cohabiting heterosexual couples are the norm, particularly amongst those who have children. As such, the amount of money a woman earns and the amount she can access are not the same. The average married woman is hardly likely to oppose her husband seeking a pay rise so he can provide for their children. In doing so, rather than embodying the stereotypically selfish, domineering corporate pig, he may be seeking greater financial reward out of a sense of responsibility, duty, and love. And it so happens that the time this becomes most pressing for him is the time that many women are pulling back from their careers. It will be an unpalatably congenial thing for a feminist to admit, but when viewed this way, the divergence in male and female earnings after a decade of work seems to be less about female subjugation than it is about female choice, male sacrifice, and familial cooperation.",AntifeministWisdom,t2_9hdlhwt2k,0.94,494,99

Now for the backlash.,"From today's Australian newspaper, a sober look at the damage that feminism in general, and #MeToo in particular, are doing to gender equality in the workplace.

>In this week of International Women’s Day ­celebrations, I have troubling news from the front line of gender relations. The conflict between men and women at work is increasing in some sectors. It’s a trend that’s worrying many who hoped our workplaces were becoming more equal for men and women and now fear they may be going backwards. Ironically, many attribute these problems to steps that have been taken to help women stay in work and get promoted. They point to well-intentioned programs designed to promote “diversity and inclusion” through flexible work, coaching and mentoring that have unintentionally sparked resentment among men. Some see it as killing with kindness.  
>  
>Last year, I wrote about the “big little lies” we tell about working and parenting (“Working lies”, Sept 1-2). It struck a chord, particularly the reports of some women with big jobs who said in public that Having It All was fantastic, while privately they were falling on the floor with exhaustion. Many working women got in touch with me in response to the article to say that while they found themselves publicly spouting the merits of “lean in” — Sheryl Sandberg’s famous pronouncement that women should be more ambitious — the ­reality is that their lives are highly stressful and sometimes chaotic. When, in December, Michelle Obama broke ranks to declare candidly, “That whole, ‘So you can have it all’ — nope, not at the same time. That’s a lie. And it’s not always enough to lean in, because that shit doesn’t work all the time,” women everywhere breathed a sigh of relief.  
>  
>Since then, I’ve been talking to some of these apparently successful women about why they ­pretend it’s working when, privately, they say they’re pushed to breaking point. Some women, depressingly, say it’s getting worse: they fear a future where there are actually fewer women at senior levels in some industries (law, finance, management consultancy, media, advertising).  
>  
>At the start of conversations about why top women don’t tell the truth, many give me the ­reasons I expect. Namely, that they want to encourage other women in the hope that having more women at the top will improve things for everyone. They also lie about their lives because they want to be loyal to their employers or, at least, to keep their jobs. Finally, they are reluctant to admit their lives are not working out because ­confessing that you’re finding things hard at work and at home sounds like an admission of failure, and high-flyers are used to being seen as a success.  
>  
>One senior woman who reflected on why she used to lie about her working reality, before she burnt out and moved out of corporate life, said: “The first thing we do is we lie to ourselves. We tell ourselves that working at this pace is normal. Then we lie to our families and colleagues — and then we lie to other women. We almost collude with each other to make this OK. Central to it, I think, is shame. And competence. I was used to being able to solve problems and move on in life, then I had kids and I didn’t know how to do it. Children aren’t a problem to be solved, they require a different state of being — one that takes effort but one that is hard to own up to. No woman wants to be thought of as a bad mother.”  
>  
>All of this makes sense. But as the conversations go on, more troubling thoughts begin to emerge. A woman who works in finance spoke on the promise of anonymity. “I am really worried that we are already at risk of going backwards on female representation at the senior levels of business, especially in finance. What I’m seeing is that the men are afraid and we’re getting the backlash. They feel the world is changing and their status is under threat. I am watching them gather around each other and close ranks. They already think women get the better deal. I worry it could actually be harder for the next group of women coming through than it was for my generation. I see so many of my friends, peers and colleagues becoming ‘mumpreneurs’ or quitting altogether because of this. It’s extremely depressing. But speaking out more publicly would, I think, create more resentment and might actually make it worse.”  
>  
>Looking out through the glass conference room doors to check nobody is watching us talking, she goes on: “I see growing resentment among men of women’s progress. Men I like personally as colleagues openly say that a lot of women get jobs because of tokenism. They don’t think they deserve the jobs. If the women then dare to ask for flexibility, they doubly resent it. We have great policies on paper around flexibility. But I’ve heard the men call working from home ‘TTP’ days, which means Taking The Piss days. Some label the women’s group at work the Burning Your Bra group and joke that it’s held around a cauldron.”  
>  
>It’s a view that columnist and former host of Top Gear Jeremy Clarkson tapped into recently when commenting on the BBC’s search for a host for one of its prime-time programs. “Anyone who has got a scrotum, forget it. They just aren’t giving jobs to men at the moment. There is an argument that it’s been all men for a long time, so what’s wrong with it being all women for some time? I get that. That’s fine. We just, as men, have to accept we’ve had it. Let’s just go down the bar.”  
>  
>And, increasingly, powerful groups of men are going to the pub or to network on the golf course without the women, excluding them once again from the inner circles where decisions are made.  
>  
>Similarly, a group of men at the advertising agency JWT have challenged a decision to let them go, after a new female creative director promised to shake things up. They say they have been discriminated against on the basis of gender, age and race. Others say it’s well overdue that the “pale, stale and male” agency had an overhaul and others were given a chance to shine. Human resources expert Claudia Iton nods knowingly at all this. “I’m reminded of the saying that, for a privileged group, any steps towards equality, however limited, can feel like discrimination,” she says.  
>  
>A corporate headhunter I spoke to observes a cycle that he worries is also making the problems worse. “If senior women are recruited and are seen to have been chosen for their gender rather than their skills, they start off in a difficult place,” he says. “However subtle it is, they will feel unsupported and may then struggle to hit their targets. This will confirm the view that women can’t cut it at those levels. In some cases, they are also being paid perhaps over the odds to help ‘reduce’ the reported pay-gap numbers. What I see are many executive boards talking the talk but not walking the walk on diversity. They are box-ticking — and the way they are doing it may make things worse.”  
>  
>All this has to be seen in the context of dramatic changes in working patterns over the past 20 years. In that time, we have moved from an expectation that most families will have one, usually male, breadwinner and the other parent in a supporting role, either based at home or working in a more flexible way. House prices and social expectations have changed and dual-income households are now seen as normal. This means that parents have to figure out how to care for their families in spite of longer hours in the office, longer commutes and potentially endless demands online. It’s not easy to do, even if you’re in charge. A chief executive of a business that prides itself on being family-friendly told me recently that, much as she tries to protect her staff from constant ­electronic intrusion, the reality is that she is still online after midnight every night of the week.  
>  
>Yet there is great potential for economic rewards from creating working patterns that appeal to those who also have caring roles. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development attributes 10-20 per cent of GDP growth in Nordic countries to the raft of measures they have introduced over the past 50 years to make work and family life more compatible. More companies are experimenting with shorter working days and weeks. German tech firm Digital Enabler has introduced a five-hour day from 8am to 1pm in a bid to attract the best talent and improve productivity by having a really focused working day.  
>  
>As yet, this isn’t the way many big businesses are going. In fact, rather the opposite. Someone who made it to the top in corporate finance, but has recently stepped out to run her own business, reflects on the additional impact of the “always on” phenomenon. She describes years of working days that started as she woke and ended when she charged her phone by the bed. So much so that her two kids chose to go to boarding school, partly because both parents worked every evening. “We did a legal deal a few years ago and the lawyers respond to emails at 1am. When do they sleep?”  
>  
>Even when she was quite senior, she says she struggled with a boss who held team meetings at 7am. “I did talk to HR, but absolutely nothing was done and I had to move teams.” Another banker reports that her company had to introduce a ­policy to stop conference calls on a Saturday. Which is good, she says, except that Sunday has instead become pretty much like any other work day.  
>  
>The problem is that many of the men who run businesses still see the world through the prism of the way it has worked for them. One mum of three says: “Most have no concept of what it means to be a co-working family. I work with men who have wives who literally pack their suitcases for them when they go on work trips. These men have no idea of the planning that their female ­colleagues, male colleagues with working partners and single parents have to do. Not to mention how much we all end up spending on emergency childcare. Because of this, it’s not unusual to find out at the very last minute that an extra day has been added to a work trip. When that happens, it can make me feel physically sick. I say nothing because they would just see it as moaning, but a change like that will have me up half the night, sorting out the arrangements for the family.” This is a woman whose husband also works but, like many I interview, she still shoulders the vast majority of the family organising.  
>  
>One lawyer continues on the impact of having a predominance of men at the top of the business: “You get a certain culture,” she says. “There is still a lot of shouting and aggression and a very high-pressured environment. There is an expectation that everything will be done immediately and that people are available pretty much all the time. They have no tolerance for someone who leaves at 4pm to pick up their kids, saying that they can’t edit a document right this moment.”  
>  
>Those who do manage to carve out a more ­balanced schedule describe the frustrations that come with it. If they managed, for example, to negotiate a three- or four-day week, they were expected to work more hours than they were paid for. They were also put on the “mummy track”.

>It is also a culture that makes those inclined to speak out hesitate. A board-level woman in banking says: “When someone asks me to speak about diversity and women in finance, my heart sinks. You know someone will be primed to savage you. They force confrontation and use bullying tactics to put you off speaking out. They say that the ‘leaking pipeline’ is just ‘lifestyle choices’. That it’s not a ‘right’, it’s a ‘choice’ to have a baby and you just have to deal with it. It puts me off speaking.”

>It isn’t just hours. A team leader at an investment bank says: “At our firm, there remains an after-work drinking culture that anyone involved in running family life can’t be a part of. It used to be that younger women would join in with that and at least have a chance of being part of the ‘in crowd’. But, since #MeToo, the men are wary. Too many stories are told about pay-offs to young women who say they were groped on a night out. It’s very hard to know the truth about these ­stories, as they usually get settled \[with a non-disclosure agreement\]. But the stories that are told are always that the woman exploited the system for money. Whether that’s the case or not, what really worries me is that a lot of other women will suffer professionally as a result. One man I work with went as far as to say, ‘Why would we include them \[women\] when they do this to us?’”  
>  
>There is evidence to support this view. A ­survey last year by Sheryl Sandberg’s [LeanIn.org](https://LeanIn.org) and ­SurveyMonkey showed that almost half of male managers who participated were uncomfortable ­mentoring, socialising or working alone with female colleagues. Sixteen per cent of male managers now hesitate to mentor a woman — more than triple the number that said this before #MeToo. Surveys suggest that ­senior men are more likely to hesitate to have a work dinner with a junior-level woman than with a junior-level man, and they are five times more likely to hesitate to travel for work with a junior-level woman. This is perhaps why some report noticing an increase in work-related social/client events that are strongly geared towards men: ­racing-car excursions, extreme ­skiing, caving — all held at weekends, of course.  
>  
>This cultural backdrop also has a negative impact on many males. One senior man in banking says: “I resent that I can’t open up my schedule to spend a few hours at the kids’ school or leave before 7pm sometimes, even though the women can. I don’t resent the women for it, but I do see it as a failure of management.” He says his executive team wouldn’t even recognise what he is talking about.  
>  
>The women I talk with acknowledge this: “I see that younger dads who want to go home at sensible times of the evening and take the parental leave they’re entitled to are afraid of being a laughing stock. People ask them, ‘Don’t you care about your career?’ Or they are accused of being henpecked. Some of these men, who feel emasculated if they ask for what women can access, grow to resent their colleagues who can work flexibly.”  
>  
>Some men are also burning with indignation that the focus seems to be on helping their female colleagues to the exclusion of their needs: “\[Women\] get mentoring, coaching and a support group — we just have to get on with the work.”  
>  
>As I listen to these stories, I despair. I see these bright, talented women who are so tempted to give up in the face of insurmountable challenges, while everyone pretends this is working out just fine. Meanwhile, the men say they too are stressed, tired and frustrated that they can’t ever escape work. The risk here is that we all shrink further back into our shells. What we urgently need are senior people to talk about these issues in public.  
>  
>The good news is that some companies are ­trying to make changes. Emma Codd, managing partner for talent at Deloitte UK, says: “When we started a move to more flexible working, I decided to calculate the costs of not addressing this — to look at the people walking out of the door that didn’t need to leave, the recruitment and training costs of replacing them and the office space we could save on — and it was clear that it was in our interests to make it happen. Since then, just in the UK, we have saved about £200 million as a result.”

>Over the past few months, I have been talking to psychologists and therapists about children raised by parents who are both working long hours.

I am not going to not say this just because it makes people feel guilty.”

542,1581il,2012-12-21,MensRights,Currently listening to my long distance boyfriend being threatened by an insane woman in his house. Police say he cannot do anything to remove her.,"EDIT: [OFFICIAL UPDATE HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/15h91w/update_currently_listening_to_my_long_distance/)

I live in the Bay Area of California and he lives in eastern Oklahoma. I'm 20 and he's 22.

We broke up about a week and a half ago after a big fight. I definitely over reacted, but so did he, and he ended up bringing home some druggy girl to have sex with to try to spite me. I'm not a sexually jealous person (been in a poly relationship before) so I wasn't too bothered by it, especially after he apologized. What neither of us anticipated though was that this girl is pretty much homeless and decided she didn't want to leave. He's typically a pretty nice person, so he told her she could sleep on his couch while she found somewhere else to go but that this was in no way a permanent solution.

Well, it's been a week and a half and she hasn't made any effort to find anywhere to go. He told her earlier today that she needed to be out *now* and he expects her to have something set up by the time he gets home from work. Well, he got home from work and she hadn't done anything. Instead, she flew into a rage. He called me and I could hear her screaming and breaking/throwing things and he sounded scared.

I told him he needed to get her shit and throw it outside, then push her out the door and lock it. He said he couldn't do any of that because she's been threatening to call the police and tell them he raped/hurt her and doesn't want to touch her at all. While he's been on the phone with me I can hear him scuffling; she keeps hitting him and trying to tear his phone out of his hand (sometimes exceeding and prematurely ending our calls) and I can hear him try to get away. Later, I myself actually heard her threatening to make false accusations unless he let her live with him.

He eventually did what I thought was the smart thing and called the police, saying she was abusing him and wanted her out of his house. He stated that he felt unsafe and that she was an unwelcome guest in his home. The police officer told him that the only thing he could do is go to the courthouse and get an eviction notice. According to the officer, if she claims his apartment is her current place of residence, it is, and he can't force her to leave - despite the fact that she is not a recognized/official tenant and doesn't pay any of the apartment's bills (rent/utilities/internet, etc). Oh, yeah, and don't forget the fact that she's beating the crap out of him and destroying his things.

We are both completely helpless right now. We are at this psycho bitch's mercy. I have been a MRA for a long time, but this is my first personal experience with such obvious injustice. If the tables were turned - some drugged out homeless dude forcing his stay in a woman's home while beating her, destroying her property and threatening her safety and freedom? No. That shit would not fly for a second.

I'm so upset right now and I'm so scared for my boyfriend. The only thing he can do right now is try to make her as uncomfortable as possible, which isn't doing much (he doesn't have a car so he's not really in a position to leave). She is furious, unstable and has an agenda. She is clearly willing to sacrifice her own comfort to make my boyfriend as miserable as possible. We have no idea what to do.

**TL;DR: Boyfriend let a homeless girl crash on his couch for a week and a half while she was supposed to be looking for somewhere else to go. He got fed up with her lack of effort and told her this morning she had until the end of the night to leave. She flew into a rage and has been hitting my boyfriend and destroying his things while I am on the phone with him. I have heard her make threats to falsely claim he raped/hurt her. Police say he cannot do anything to legally forcibly remove her. We are essentially at her mercy and she doesn't seem to want to leave any time soon.**

Edit (4:04 a.m. PST): She has told my boyfriend that she has pictures of her face with bruises and that she will show them to the police claiming it was him who hurt her. He is trying to get an officer to come to his house to see that she is okay. I have told him he needs to tell the police to drug test her so her credibility will be severely dented, and also to try to have a friend over to be witness to her actions (if we're lucky maybe she will chill out of embarrassment when someone else is there). He hasn't responded to these ideas yet.

Edit 2 (4:45 a.m. PST): It has been over an hour since I talked to my boyfriend last. I cannot reach him. He is not answering my calls or responding to my texts. The last thing I heard from him was that he was going to try to have an officer come over to prove that this girl is unharmed. I'm very concerned because we'd been talking heavily through this ordeal the entire time it was going down and suddenly he is completely unresponsive. I hope he is okay and didn't get arrested. If he misses work one more time he is going to get fired.

Edit 3 (5:00 a.m. PST): He finally called me back. Apparently now she has this convenient story about how she was supposedly kidnapped and raped. What relevance that has to the situation, I'm not sure. However, he was smart and took the opportunity to pretend to sympathize with her to calm her down. She still hasn't left but at least now she's not demonstrating violent and erratic behavior. He managed to get a friend from work to come over for a little bit and he saw that she is crazy and unharmed, so at least now he has another witness besides me. He never mentioned anything about the cops coming over but it doesn't seem like they'd do anything anyway. He is absolutely exhausted from this whole ordeal. I told him he needs to grab all of his valuables and lock himself in his room for the night. We'll see have to wait and see what happens from here.",poop_dawg,t2_5gyeo,0.89,337,309

546,132ytav,2023-04-29,MensRights,Iceland: Climax of feminist delusion and manipulation,"Recently, in Iceland, a famous feminist, Edda Falak, resigned from her position as a journalist at an Icelandic news magazine. She hosted a podcast where supposed victims talked about their alleged perpetrators, often making their names public.

&#x200B;

Now it was revealed that Edda Falak who holds an MSc in Finance actually lied about her employment history. The interesting part is that she claimed to have been sexually harassed at a workplace where she never was.

&#x200B;

[https://www.visir.is/g/20232393557d/-eg-thykist-vita-ad-heimildin-se-komin-i-akvedna-klemmu-](https://www.visir.is/g/20232393557d/-eg-thykist-vita-ad-heimildin-se-komin-i-akvedna-klemmu-)

&#x200B;

Furthermore, there are also clear hints that she plagiarized in her master's thesis as it seems to be almost identical to another thesis that was submitted at the same business school she attended.

&#x200B;

[https://www.visir.is/g/20232398059d](https://www.visir.is/g/20232398059d)

&#x200B;

Edda Falak is also known to have pushed the campaign #believeallwomen

&#x200B;

""Edda told about her frustrations in several interviews with media such as [mbl.is](https://mbl.is) and [vísir.is](https://vísir.is). She did this at the same time as she and others quickly launched a campaign entitled ""I believe"" which aimed to get society to accept the idea that all women should always be believed if they report gender-based harassment or violence. Because who else would benefit from lying about such things?""

&#x200B;

What is concerning is that nearly all feminists and feminist organizations in Iceland do not see any problems with that. On the contrary, they defend and normalize lying and manipulation. They also deny that it can cause psychological harm if you lie about someone.

&#x200B;

They compare it with things like ""stealing a pen"" or ""not mentioning in a resume to have also have worked at an orphanage"".

&#x200B;

A counselor at an Icelandic rape crisis center even implies that she lied ""out of trauma"" and that it is no big deal to make yourself bigger than you are from time to time and to lie about your positions at jobs. No big deal to claim to have worked for reputable companies in prestigious positions when in fact you haven't.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That same woman, by the way, complained about a man who also lied about his job to her and called him a narcissist.

&#x200B;

She completely ignores that Edda seems to have committed plagiarism in her master's thesis. Would have been funny if she also apologized that behavior and claimed that it's normal when you're traumatized. When you're traumatized, it's okay to plagiarize. No need to take responsibility anymore.

&#x200B;

It should be mentioned that the organization where this woman works has some shady background.

&#x200B;

And she talks about a lack of morality in society...

549,16ep1mb,2023-09-10,MensRights,"There is no more paygap in westen countries, the price to pay? a whole lot of unemployed men, and stressed out overworked ones.","Let me just start by stating one very important fact. When we talk about paygap, or rather, when they talk about it. We are not talking about construction workers, oil drillers, waste collectors, brick layers... No, as far as women in general, and feminists specifically are concerned when it comes to these jobs they're like, you go do these physically taxing very difficult jobs that I am quite literally incapable of doing. These jobs are not the subject of our rant. 

The subject of the paygap rant is the nice cozy office jobs. With the nice airconditionning, the pretty desk, and the last-tech laptop.  

And the content of the rant is: I am a woman and I am paid less than the man because I'm a woman. This is just a next level evil lie and manipulation. Why would the CEO of a company give two fucks if you were a man, a woman, or an alien. As long as you are productive. Every fucking thing a company does is motivated by money. if women performed better than men, men would be underpaid. If men outperformed women, women will be underpaid. And let's just call it what the fuck it really is, it's not ""underpaid"", it's paid depending on the level of performance. And aside from the fact that women only complain about these nice office jobs, as a career they chase the coziest of these office jobs, but that's not the subject of this topic. 

The subject of this topic is that men, very simply almost always outperform women in these nice jobs and by a huge margin. Why? Biological and also psychological reasons. I will just flat out ditch the biological reasons so the sexist argument is not invoked. Let us do a very simple roleplay. Imagine you are a woman and an accountant in an office and you fuck something up, there will be at least 4 coworkers jumping up to help you, tell you it's okay and it happened to them too. And they fix it for you. As a result you no longer panic, and you don't really learn because you don't have to. You'll always be saved. 

Now imagine you are a man and you fuck up, a pure hearted colleague might help you, but let's be honest here. It's either you fix your fuckup by yourself and you become more competent, or you get fired. And the most likely outcome is the first one.  

So biological reasons aside. Due to the high accountability and expectations from men, and the lower one from women. Men quite simply are more competent. And they are more competent because of the pain and anxiety they have to go through. It's no privilege. 

For years women were ""underpaid"", they were not underpaid. They were paid the right price for their competence. And their pay gape rants are exactly like a junior employee asking for the same salary as a senior one. And when they were ""underpaid"". They still had boyfriends and husbands that took them to restaurants and paid the bill under the tradition of chivalry. 

Now let's fast forward to the age of no more paygap. Where most women are getting paid as much, and in many cases more than men. What do we really have? 

\- The demand for no paygap only exists in the coziest of jobs. 

\- Women are getting the same pay, for much lesser work. 

\- The Women are still chasing men who make much more than them. (This is a whole different subject)

\- A whole lot of competent men are unemployed. 

I will elaborate on the last point for now. Companies are all about money like I said earlier, they're not just gonna pay women the same as men knowing they won't perform as well and handle the financial losses. No, they will quite simply hire women with the most average skills, but only hire the best of the best of men. Because these men are supposed to not only do their jobs, but to always do the work the women with the same pay cannot do or finish. So who are the casulaties? Men who are quite competent, but not very competent. Because now you're not gonna be hired for your ability to do your job only, but also for your ability to do your job and the unfinished job of your female coworkers. 

All of what I said, is an analysis from a daily experience as someone who is not originally from the west, came to the west and saw how it works. I don't give two fucks if I am called ""sexist"" or ""mysogynistic"". As a matter of fact whenever someone uses those words without providing an antithesis, I just know that I am 100% correct.

550,97lr2y,2018-08-15,MensRights,Hostile work environment: many men now fearful of interacting with women in the workplace,"[""Changed by MeToo""](https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/changed-by-me-too#slide-14)

NBC highlights a series of quotes by both men and women in post MeToo era.   

The women give mostly vague answers.   Some of them say they feel more ""empowered"".   

A few of the men say it hasn't affected them, however the majority are as follows: 

""I minimize my interaction with women now and under no circumstances will I be in a room alone with a woman again."" 

""I won't say anything to a woman about her clothes, shoes, hair, etc.""  

""I have always been respectful of all co-workers, but after MeToo, I find myself avoiding social interactions entirely.   I've become more disconnected than ever."" 

""I am more cautious around women.   I try to not look in their general direction anymore…I tend to imagine that I am interacting with a male co-worker or a sophisticated AI, a machine if you will.""

""I no longer feel comfortable joking around with [women] about any topic, as these days they can say anything feels like an unwanted sexual advance.""   

""I can't do anything anymore.""  

""It made me a little afraid to say anything to female/male co-workers that they may take it the wrong way and scream MeToo.   I find my conversations are much shorter than they normally would be.   They are strictly about work and nothing else.   No questions about family, friends, what they did over the weekend and things like that.""  

""I keep all interactions and discussions with women as short as possible and limited to work-related topics only, with no joking around.""  

""Even before MeToo, I would not meet with students in my office with the door closed.  Now, many of my colleagues will not allow a female students alone in their office even with the door open.""  

""No more young people of any gender can go on trips with management.  People who do travel together must also be the same gender.   We also cannot sit next to each other on the plane.""  

""No meeting with women in my office.  No one-on-one meetings with any women.   No more walk-and-talk meetings with women to the coffee shop.  When traveling, I will no longer coordinate to be on the same flight or sit next to a female co-worker.   No hugs for anyone."" 

""Everyone's afraid of being falsely accused of something.  The 'human factor' has disappeared…There is no sense of friendliness or warmth anymore so that nothing can be misconstrued."" 

So to summarize: the relationship between the sexes in the workplace is now ice cold.   The ""human factor"" is disappearing, and many men are clearly uncomfortable even engaging in small talk with the opposite sex.    

Some men and women have been subject to actual sexual harassment in the workplace; and men responded to these complaints several decades ago by introducing various anti-harassment policies.   

Feminists have not improved matters.   Instead, they have succeeded in creating a hostile work environment for ALL workers.     

Women will themselves be negatively affected by these trends.   However, one quote from the article anticipates that feminists will not take responsibility for their grossly irresponsible behavior, and instead blame -- you guessed it -- the patriarchy.   

""I am a woman and MeToo has screwed me.  In Silicon valley it is really hard to get time with VCs [venture capitalists], so you do whatever it takes.  A lot of time that would be meeting them at a bar in the evening…It is good networking and that is how I got my initial seed funding.   But now no one wants to meet with a woman under 40.  Even in the office they won't be alone with you.

I’ve been thinking about it for a while…I am now a Men’s Rights Advocate.,"I’m posting this from a throwaway that I don’t plan on using much, if at all. I need to do so because I’ve worked in Democratic Party politics (and have career goals working for the party), and there are plenty of factions within the party that are still hostile to the MRM. I don’t want my name slandered, and I don’t want to be called a misogynist simply because some men and women disapprove of my stance toward the MRM.

Let me start off by saying that I used to be a feminist in high school. I went to protests, spoke to other young men about feminism, and smugly preached about equality from my moral pedestal. 

I went to a pretty good college with a multitude of women studying the liberal arts. I need to mention this because I’ve had quite a few classmates who will one day become leaders of the feminist movement (authors, organization leaders, etc.). Rest assured that their radical views and sexist opinions against men made me disown my feminist label.

I’ve always liked this forum for its discussion, but I would never have called myself an MRA, even on the Internet. Last Friday changed that for me, and I’m thankful for it. I never thought that I would be accused of assault, and I never thought that a woman could get away with assaulting a man in front of others. I've had a friend falsely accused of rape i ncollege, but I thought to myself, ""Hey, it's not me. None of my business."" I was always afraid of the MRA label because of what others might say about me. 

What happened to me?

I was at a bar on Friday when another guy bumped into me. I apologized, but the dude was looking for a fight. He grabbed my collar and pushed me back. I got in his face (I know, immature, but I couldn’t let him push me around). I asked that he drop the issue and we go on our own paths. He insists on stirring the pot.

He really wants to fight. I push him back and try to get a bouncer. As I’m moving back, the girl he’s with pushes me, slaps me, and then dumps her drink on me. 

When I tell him to back the both of them up…she grabs me and hits me again.

Now the entire bar is looking at me while I’m getting hit by this girl. She knows I cant, and won’t, defend myself. Every man and woman in the room is looking at me and not helping. 

The bouncers break her of me.

…and they kick me, not her, out of the bar. 

Why? The bouncers, who, to their credit, acted very courteously, explained that the female bartender said that I, the guy, had to have started it. In her opinion, the bouncers stated, there’s no way the girl, a few inches shorter than me, would aggressively attack a man. The bouncers were going to call the police because I allegedly attacked a woman. 

I had the opportunity explain my side of the story to the bouncers, who then corroborated it with the camera footage of the bar. The cameras saved me. If they weren’t there, I would have been banned from the bar and arrested for assault, as the girl wanted to call the police
--
Even if the story didn’t entertain you, I just wanted to say thank you for this forum. 

If I ever make it far in Democratic Party politics, you’ll have an MRA speaking to the leaders of the party. We still need to promote our dialogue and conversations to the national profile. We need to change the narrative surrounding men and assault. We can’t let people get away with promoting the idea of male privilege while men can be falsely accused so easily. 

I’m in a hurry, so I have to go. I’m just another guy who has joined the MRM today. Keep up the good work. 

EDIT: I came back just to answer two questions I'm seeing constantly repeated below:

1. There is videotape, and yes, the girl and her party were thrown out of the bar.

2. I'm not going to press charges. Why? 1. We were in an establishment that sells alcohol, so authorities might think it's two drunken people acting stupid 2. Let's all be honest here, if I wanted to knock out the girl and the rest of her guy friends, I could have done it. I'm literally a trained fighter. And because of that, I have a feeling it would get used against me in court. 3. Guys, if this ever hit the media, and even if I am proven innocent and the charges stick (which the 100% would), don't you think ANY political party would use this as ammunition? I've worked in media--powerful media outlets have a narrative. Man defending himself from women does NOT fall within the narrative. 

Apologies for the grammar and typos. I'm on my way home from work.

1. Men suicide 4x more then woman. One dude i know already lost 3 of his M friends to suicide!!! And personally I have lost my brother to suicide when he was 23.
2. 2.Men are pretty much almost twice as susceptible to end up abusing drugs/alcohol (\~6% vs \~12% for men).
3. 70% of homeless people are men.
4. Men have 10x + chance to die in the workplace.
5. Men have next to no social support and networks compared to woman.
6. Men are 2.5x more likely to develop videogame addiction (probably because real life sucks more for them I know that its a good way to avoid having to deal with reality)
7. Men don't do as well in school at least not with the modern system and woman are more present in higher education programs and obtain more diplomas then men.
8. It is way harder for men to find a partner( IMO especially since the rise of dating websites and social medias). I think a good proof is there's way less women using dating apps then there are men, i assume simply out of a lack of necessity in the first place.
9. Pretty sure woman live on average 8 years longer then men, because life is fair like that lol.
10. Young woman nowadays earn more money then young men meanwhile young men are still most of the time expected to provide for their families and even be a bigger earner then his female partner. Not even going to get into dating/romantic stuff (early relationship / dating life).
11. When shit goes down for your country youre more likely to be forcefully enrolled in the army. and when shit goes down in any other situation you're almost expected to be brave and know how to fight and even defend other people, or just having to resolve things by violence when dealing with other men.
12. Getting fucked over in court and losing custody unless something is terribly wrong with the mother.
13. How modern tv/ads/movies (hollywood in particular) has recently started to make men look stupid, foolish and inferior, there is almost no inspirational roles portraying strong male characters anymore, now its only strong female characters and they're hella overpowered, they make sure the audience knows without a doubt that they're doing everything better then men.
14. I don't care if its a small minority or if they have been lucky with good genetics, young woman can use onlyfans if they are willing and they can earn way more in their 20's alone then a doctor or any other top tier job man ever could in his entire life. Meanwhile I also have good genetics and I am young but if I did the same I wouldn't even be able to afford a bag of chips a month with my earnings i bet...  You will say, well woman with good genetics go to modeling and pornography, and men with good genetics go to sports... But I'm pretty sure it's quite a bit harder to become a pro NFL player or something then it is to strip naked on onlyfans or show some cleavage on twitch while licking a plastic ear and moaning.
15. Woman have WAY higher standards in general and specifically on dating apps/websites where they will swipe a guy positively a lot less often then a man will swipe a woman positively, which means the competition to find a partner is astonishingly harder as the average man. Not even close. I've even heard 2% swipe rate meanwhile men swipe HARD. I don't really want to discuss men swipe rate because I've heard that a lot of them will literally swipe all the girls, not that this is a pro-male argument anyways lol, it means theyre literally so desperate...

558,ys0kj,2012-08-24,MensRights,The sexism coming from the women in my workplace is astounding.,"We were having our Friday lunch together in the office, as we do every week, and a conversation came up about the new CEO of Yahoo and how she was pregnant but not taking maternity leave. I decided to note that the husband could take it instead, which I thought would be a great idea since she's clearly got lots of work ahead of her.

In comes a comment from an early 20-something, ""It's not the same."" ""Yeah, it is,"" I replied, casually and informatively. ""It's not at *all* the same,"" she responded.

The conversation quickly shifted at that point, which was for the best. Had we stayed on that topic, I think tensions would've run incredibly high. That was about 6 hours ago now, but the moment still resounds in my mind angrily and with contempt. That she, an unwed, child-free woman would so quickly dismiss the value of the bond between a father and his newborn child repulses me. This kind of attitude is something I've dealt with for at least the last 2 years at my job.

For most of my career, I tried to avoid the topic of being a woman in business, vaguely concerned that talking too much about it would hold me back in some way. My standard response: “Oh gosh, I never really think about being a woman in business. I’m just focused on getting the job done.”

But I’ve been thinking about it over the past year…..a lot.

And it’s not just because of the fairness issue, important though that is. It’s because the research and business case for the economic advancement of women is so compelling, in a world deeply in need of greater economic prosperity.

This holds at the country level, where the increased participation of women moderates the political process and paves the way for a healthier economy. And it is true at the business level, where companies with greater diversity in senior management have higher returns, lower volatility, more innovation, greater customer focus, better stockholder returns and lower gender pay disparity.

Despite this, the progress of women in business has plateaued. And while there has been a renewal of the national discussion on how to break this logjam, if the answer were one-dimensional, the challenge would already have been solved. The answer can be as unique to every woman as her own definition of personal and professional success.

And that leads to “why a professional women’s network.” Networks are beginning to operate alongside the traditional corporate structure, serving as a modern means for individuals to come together to exchange ideas and information. They enable their members to contribute to, and pull from, the network to accomplish more than the sum of the parts would indicate.

Powerful connections can increasingly be made outside the C-suites, boardrooms and private clubs. The women of 85 Broads engage with one another at events and on topics such as how to establish a personal brand, how to negotiate more successfully, how to get a book published, how to make effective sales presentations, how to be a better boss, how to be more effective at social media, how to improve executive presence, how to increase resilience, how to prepare for public service, how to improve one's chance of getting on a board.....you get the point....

In doing this, networking has been shown to increase professional success: research shows that one of the “unwritten rules” of advancement in business has been a strong network.…both inside one’s workplace and, very powerfully, outside as well. Don’t think of these as tired “support groups;” they are instead platforms for the exchange and promotion of information and ideas, accelerating one’s acquisition of skills and knowledge. Doing so outside of one’s company exposes one to different thinking, which can be important in avoiding “group think.” These benefits hold for individuals in a more traditional corporate setting, while entrepreneurs with larger and more diverse networks have been shown to grow their businesses more quickly.

The next step is to move from advocacy to real investments in women, just as smart companies – and smart investors – are increasingly recognizing.

I am becoming involved with and investing in 85 Broads because investing in women is smart business. And women investing in themselves and in others, as they do through the network, is even smarter business.

As many of you will have noticed, every day when you open the home page, there are a lot of news and reports and comments that start to hate each other. And this wave is beginning to move from online to offline.

But what people may not yet realise is that the consequences of this series of problems go far beyond that.

The same problem was actually played out decades ago in Japan, Korea, Europe and the US, to three different, but not quite good, ends.

So, in order to dissolve the hatred and antagonism as much as possible, to defend the good tradition of equality between men and women in our country, to stop someone from driving backwards under the moral flag, and to defend the modern life of all of us, I am here to summarise in full the history and lessons learned from the gender antagonism in Japan, South Korea, Europe and the United States, in the hope that we can learn from history and not step into the same pit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1 Japan, which lies flat off the hook

Many people have heard of Japan's gender dichotomy and the end of the collapse of women's rights with all men lying flat, but this description is actually not very accurate, not to mention the socio-economic level of the reasons behind.

The gender dichotomy in Japan started thirty years ago during the Heisei era.

Many people have wondered why there was no feminist movement in Japan and Korea despite the low status of women.

The answer is ""there was.""

In the 1980s, there was a boom period in the Japanese economy before the bubble burst...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[before the bubble burst](https://preview.redd.it/sn0ptfxr166b1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a1623eb480b0ec1848046d6e18e4c487a03f77c)

&#x200B;

The rise in economic income and employment has been accompanied by a surge in feminist thinking in Japan. How high was it? The Japanese female narrative at the time was that a woman should have four boyfriends: the errand boy, the bill-payer boy, the gift boy, and, well, the honcho. When women were invited to dinner, it had to be a fancy restaurant for 50,000 yen or more, and they had to go to fancy hotels and give expensive jewellery.

&#x200B;

I am a new age independent and outstanding woman, of course you have to show sincerity if you want to chase me. There was even a term for this phenomenon - relationship capitalism.

Later, along with the economic development, it was further developed into the ""Heisei New Woman"".

The difference between the New Heisei Women and the Capitalism of Love was that they did not even want to fall in love.

&#x200B;

The idea of the New Heisei Women was not to get married and to ignore men. We women are beautiful, we have to help each other, men are ""stinky men"", we women have to pursue ""freedom"", we encourage women to get married? That is a conspiracy by men to squeeze us women through marriage.

&#x200B;

In short, you can understand relationship capitalism as the wave of feminism that demands a bride price.

The new women of Heisei understand it as the wave of feminism that is anti-bride price and emphasises the rights of the workplace at the social level.

But despite the differences, there is a general agreement, a common condemnation of male perpetrators in any case, a common opposition to sexual harassment, and an opposition to discrimination in the workplace.

Doesn't this seem like a good development for the new women of Heisei?

But the problem is that, slowly, Japanese women's rights are beginning to appear to expand, or, as one group gets a sense of superiority over another, they tend to move towards discrimination and antagonism.

&#x200B;

I am a noble new Heisei woman, you are an ordinary Japanese man, where do you get the right to stand with me?

&#x200B;

If a man touches a woman on the underground for any reason, he is called an idiot, and if a leader sends an email to a female subordinate, it is sexual harassment in the workplace. Even if a colleague in the office looks at me, I can interpret it as a sign of misconduct.

In a way, Japanese feminism has taken a turn for the worse, calling men all QJ offenders. Or, rather, it is easier to spread and more easily understood by all than the previously academic and discursive feminist thinking. - Whoever has a cheaper ticket to the kingdom of heaven will have more believers

&#x200B;

All kinds of amplification and even smear cases were also the order of the day in public opinion at the time. This is why the invention of women-only carriages was not first seen in the Middle East, for example, but first in Japan, where it was thought that direct physical segregation would solve these problems well. With physical isolation, women didn't have to worry about demented men and men didn't have to worry about social death, so I'm asking if you're perfect.

But the problem is that the bubble years are over and the lost 20 years have arrived. Many articles introduced here will give the conclusion that Japanese men lie flat and that feminist demands collapsed straight away after losing their buyers.

&#x200B;

But in fact the change in social thinking is not so simple. Behind the social phenomenon, the essence is still a change in the economy and industry. The essence of the development of feminism in Japan was actually the urbanisation dividend brought about by the country's economic development, when Japanese companies were willing to pay a high premium. Male university students were given high salaries straight out of school, and female students were also given high salaries out of school.

&#x200B;

[\(\\""Daily News\\"", 1989, a college girl with a happy face at the inauguration ceremony of Mitsui Corporation\)](https://preview.redd.it/e0wyzz7g266b1.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=54e04620fdcd9f70c6bff3d69c742737b37e45f2)

When women move out of the productive environment of the past into the metropolis and are given complete economic freedom, they naturally begin to fire at the parts of the past that may have bound them to tradition. I can live in Tokyo alone on my salary and have enjoyed the modern life and all the rich entertainment in Tokyo, and you want me to go back home and get married? How can I live the way I used to live and follow the rules of the past? Why?

The economic base determined the superstructure, and changes in production relations led to changes in thinking.

In fact, not only women, but also young Japanese men were turning their backs on the traditions of the past, and it was during this period that the otaku, for example, emerged. In today's terms, young men and women in Japan at the time denounced tradition, denounced their families of origin, and posted posts about how ""all parents are scourges"" (is that too similar?).

Why were women more vocal? Because male university students are just at the age of love and marriage, there is a lot of consumption piled on girls, and the superposition is that the purchasing power of young women at that time is terribly high, which is the source of the legend of the four purses. Strong purchasing power inevitably led to discourse. Fashion magazines are all about luxury goods, and their main buying group is basically young women, so fashion magazines naturally turn to compliment women.

Sorry ahead of time for the rant and the throwaway. This just happened and I'm furious and sad at the same time. 

A woman tried to sneak her car through a left turn against the light this morning. I had the right of way, but stopped in time when I saw her turning. She apparently still didn't have enough room and clipped my car. Quite clearly her fault. I note her license plate (I've been hit and run several times before), but she pulls over.

I get out and ask her for her information. Politely. Maybe I'm a bit stern, but that's all. She immediately tells me I'm being abusive and that she won't give me her info. I told her I'm going to have to call the cops. I ask her once again for her info, and she tells me no, call the cops. I definitely called her some names for being so deliberately difficult.

I thought she had called a friend, but when the cops arrived, they were several, and I was quickly informed I was being watched and recorded. Of course, I was standing off the side with my hands down, so I'm really surprised that this cop is talking with such hostility towards me. I haven't even explained to him what happened yet!

He goes and talks to the woman, first, and then comes back to get my information, which, again, I'm calmly standing, holding my stuff, and waiting. 

The cop tells me that the damage is minor, and I better watch myself, because this is a disturbance, not a traffic accident call, and I've been reported as being abusive. He tells me that the damage is minor, and I should just let it go, because of my abuse, which he's putting in his report. He tells me I shouldn't conduct myself that way, and tells me my personal life and business are going to suffer because of it. I'm flabbergasted, still standing there calm, but definitively agitated.

This isn't the first time this has happened. When I was first married, my ex (female) cheated on me with about a dozen different guys. She would tell me about it to make me feel bad. Finally, I got out when I realized that the stigma of divorce was better than life with her. After all those guys, and all those clear choices about how she feels in our relationship, she goes crazy when she finds out I have a new girlfriend, rings my doorbell late at night, and when I answer, knees my nuts, steals my keys, throws them in the street, and rips my flowers out of their flower boxes. I'm forced to retrieve my keys from the middle of the main street in my town in my underwear. I called the cops, the officer refused to prosecute. I ended up filing a PFA (like a restraining order), but she just made stuff up and got one on me (she said I followed her around the store, when we were really shopping together, and arrived in the same car...).

Back to the present, I tried to explain to the cop that she refused to give her information, which is a crime, and she lied about the accident, to a cop, a crime, and that she hit my car in the first place. He didn't want to hear it. He told me to calm down, several times, even though I was just standing there, definitely agitated, but not making any wild movements, not yelling, etc. 

The cop didn't care. He was on her side, and even tried to convince me to let it go. He told me that he's an expert in the law, and that I'm in the wrong here. I was left feeling humiliated and unrepresented. After all, I had called for help when someone hit me. 

I'm so sick with anger and frustration right now. I've scheduled an appt with my therapist, who I'm sure will tell me that I need to work on my coping skills. Yes, that's right, no one needs to work on telling the truth, or being nice to others. I just have to work on how well I react when abused.

The best part is that I normally drive with a dashcam but forgot it this morning. It would have been all on video.

We work on a competitive field, and I've noticed that marernity leave is treated as a ""get out of work for a few months"" jolly card and many of these women come back after 5 or 6 months and expect to have their careers untouched. I'm not talking about being able to have paternity leave (which men have), I'm talking about the indifference to men when it comes to career responsibility: women can drop everything and disappear untouched. Men don't.

In my experience, men cannot just take 1 or 2 months of holidays and expect nothing's going to change for them at the job. Don't get me wrong, I know having children isn't holidays, but it's still a choice, just as would be going on vacation.

What's even worse: if I want a vacation, I have to schedule it and it needs to be approved. If a woman gets pregnant, she's (and rightfully so) under no obligation to schedule it or getting it approved, she would just one day drop into the office and announce it, and everything and everyone will have to re-shift priorities for her.

Equality is equality. We deserved to be treated the same way, not be expected to carry the company's weight while women keep going in and out for this issue. We had 6 different women disappearing in the last 2 years and it's been hell. I almost couldn't even go in vacation to cover for shifts, and I'm not the only one. How is this fair?

What I'm trying to say is, while I'm all for giving women the current set of rights they have in regards to having children, shouldn't the companies give men some sort of similar treatment or benefits that would reward them if they *don't* want to have children but still want something else from life?

But hey, try telling a woman who went on maternity leave for 5 months that she no longer holds the same position in the company and it's hell... sexist, misogynist and unfair. Sure, like the guy who had to cover for her, who now has to step back or get fired, so that mommy can get back on that horse!

This isn't the middle ages: women can *decide* to have children, and they have to *choose* to give stuff up, just like I would have to give stuff up if I *decided* to go on a 3 months cruise. But no, it's treated as an untouchable right of the human being. Besides, who cares, there's always some men around to do the work for them while they are away, right?

And don't even question it, otherwise you are a misogynistic prick... Equality is equality.

570,9ne96o,2018-10-11,MensRights,"It is now males, rather than females, who suffer the vast majority of institutional discrimination","I don't believe that males have ever been [privileged](https://www.amazon.ca/Privileged-Sex-Martin-van-Creveld/dp/1484983122) in the way feminists claim.   But we are now at the point where the deck is stacked against males at every stage of their lives and in almost every major institution.   

When a male is born he can have his genitals mutilated. Hundreds of baby boys die from this procedure every year.

Then comes primary school, where boys are often punished and even drugged for displaying natural boyish behavior. Recent studies have also revealed that female teachers mark down boys by an average of 20 percent for the same work.

Huge numbers of boys are now being raised without fathers (including about 99 percent of school shooters, funny how we never talk about that), and since pedo hysteria has chased male teachers out of primary school, boys often don't have any male role models until much later in life.

Boys only clubs (eg the Boy Scouts) are being eliminated while girl only clubs remain.

Teenage boys are being introduced to blatantly misandrist concepts like ""toxic masculinity,"" with narry a word about toxic femininity and nothing about the positive aspects of masculinity.

Next it's off to University, where there are a range of female-specific scholarships and programs even though women make up the majority of college students and young women are now out-earning young men. They are also portrayed as rapists in waiting, and there are entire departments (gender studies) devoted to demonizing their sex. If a young man pisses off a young woman (eg dumps her after a one night stand) he faces the possibility of being subjected to a false accusation and a feminist Kangaroo court. Then it's bye bye academic career and social reputation.

If he wants to vote he will have to sign over his body to the state (selective service).

If he gets a woman pregnant he will not have the option of legal parental surrender. While a woman can just drop off the baby at a safe haven, the man is on the hook for 18 years of child support and will be locked up if he loses his job and can't pay.

In the workplace things are just as bad. Men perform almost all of the dirty and dangerous jobs and make up 95 percent of workplace injuries and deaths. If a white man wants to pursue a more respected career he faces racial and sexual discrimination in hiring due to corporate ""diversity"" measures and quotas. A recent study in...I think it was Australia found that ""blind hiring"" practices (where the employer doesn't know the race or sex of the applicant) result in more straight white males being hired; this means that it is straight white men who are now suffering discrimination in the workplace.

With MeToo, a man can be fired from his job simply for making a woman uncomfortable. There have even been cases of men being fired for telling a naughty joke.

If he gets married and the wife divorces him through no fault of his own he will likely be treated like shit by the family courts unless he can afford a high priced lawyer. There are countless stories of men effectively being turned into indentured servants by their ex-wives; they live in poverty and seldom see their kids while the wife gets a new ""baby daddy"" and lives high on the hog. NOW, the largest feminist organization in the world, continues to oppose shared parenting even though every single study shows it to be in the best interests of the children, the father and even the mother.

He will receive less social support, less health care spending, and be relentlessly demonized in the media. 

If a male is sexually assaulted by a woman he will probably not receive justice; the perp will likely get a slap on the wrist even if the victim is a boy.  

If he commits a crime or is falsely accused of a crime he will be treated much, much more harshly by the criminal justice system.

I could go on.

It is a myth that feminists think the sexes are equal. Their MO goes like this: if men are ahead in some area, that means women are being oppressed because the sexes are identical except for genitalia; however, if women are ahead in some area that's because women are superior. You can find this sentiment going back to the first wave. Elizabeth Cady Stanton claimed that women are ""infinitely superior"" to men.

The prison thing is perhaps the most glaring example of feminists not practicing what they preach. If they were serious about equality they would be demanding either that men be treated with more compassion/leniency or that women be treated more harshly (or some combination of the two). Instead, they want women to be treated even *more* leniently, and some are even advocating for the complete abolition of female prisons.

Men are increasingly second class citizens not only in a social but legal sense. A study in the UK determined that if women were treated like men by the criminal justice system, fully half of all prisoners would be female. Women do NOT commit less crimes than men (though they do commit less homicides), they just don't get punished to anywhere near the same extent.

If feminism were an ""equality"" movement they would not be trying to privilege females in every single institution.    They would be looking with a keen eye at areas in which males are disadvantaged and/or subject to institutional discrimination.   They certainly wouldn't blame everything on some nebulous all-encompassing ""patriarchy"" that hasn't even been proven to exist.  

Advocates of gender equality must reject feminism, and support men's rights.  ",Vwar,t2_15qoa077,0.86,2555,252

I also highly suggest researching Michael Kimmel. He basically invented Men’s Studies.


I’m anti-patriarchy, because patriarchy negatively affects men and women. Patriarchy is, essentially, the set of rules that says men do this, women do this, men are this, women are this. And this set of rules is extremely dangerous for men.

Men are drafted, women cannot be.
Men are way more likely to get the shit end of the stick in a divorce.
Men are expected to put their bodies in danger all the time, and women are not. 
Men have to deal with being feared all the time, and women do not. 
Men are far more likely to be incarcerated
Black men are far more likely to get shot than black women. 

Now here’s where I’ll get downvoted into oblivion: I’m a feminist who is pro men’s rights. I’m not a feminist because I hate men: I’m a feminist because I hate patriarchy. Actual feminism is about gender equality; patriarchy is against gender equality. It is framed as more favorable to men, but that is false. Patriarchy is favorable to a few rich white men at the tippy top of the food chain who have millions of little bootlicker minions of all genders and races.

I don’t see eye to eye with many men’s rights activists. I don’t think being dominant over women or being “alpha” will improve any man’s life. Because it’s the norm that men are the strong ones that causes them to either die or kill themselves. Men need to be taken care of too. 

I also don’t believe that false accusations happen nearly as often as men think they do. Anecdotally, catcalls, flashing, and grabby hands from strangers are a daily occurrence for me: a woman living in NYC. The same cannot be said of my boyfriend. If there is a man here who receives unwanted sexual attention on a DAILY basis from strangers, I’m all ears. But don’t we think a society where bad women think they can get away with accusing innocent men of rape because society will always see them as a victim would probably be the same society where bad men think they can get away with raping women because they’ve been taught that women are victims? Don’t you think such a society ought to be changed?

Of course, there is no way I myself can prove every woman v man sexual assault case beyond a reasonable doubt. So I’ll stick to what I can prove:

Feminists and men’s rights activists both believe that current gender roles where men are scary and strong while women are cowardly and weak are harmful. They disagree about who the victim is; not realizing it’s all of us.",Imayilingualbay,t2_uolrvp0f,0.89,191,21
573,hq4ts6,2020-07-12,MensRights,Are men treated better than women? A trans man's point of view.,"I've always thought that sexism, be is misogyny or misandry, can best be understood through experience.  I am transsexual which means that I have experienced both being perceived as a woman and a man by society. So here's my experience and the reason I'm an MRA.

Background:

I'm ftm transsexual.  I spent the first 18 years of my life as a girl/woman and these last 2 as a man. 

My experiences as a woman:

The good:

Most people treated me very well.  Those who didn't mistreated me because I'm autistic, not because I was a girl.  I was never made to feel bad whenever I asked for help, people were happy to help me.  Guys were happy to help with emotional issues particularly.  Whenever I was having a bad day, they were happy to talk with me and keep me company.  Overall, my mental health and well-being was taken more seriously.  Additionally, it was easier to make friends.  From what I can tell, others just felt more comfortable around me and felt safer sharing their problems with me.

The bad:

I honestly can't think of anything.  I've never experienced misogyny.  I wasn't exactly attractive so I never got any sexual/romantic attention from guys be that positive or negative.  The only thing I can think of was that a few girls at school were mean to me but again that's because of my mental disability, not because I was a girl. That and they were just shitty friends in general. I think this too would have been worse if I was attractive as I would have been seen as competition.

My experiences as a man:

The good:

Socially, nothing really improved. I hear some people say that men are taken more seriously with certain things, especially when it comes to the workplace, but at my work men and women are treated the same.  I feel more confident now, but that's because my gender dysphoria has lessoned considerably.

The bad:

I don't feel comfortable asking for help anymore, especially when it comes to mental health.  Whenever I do people are less enthusiastic about helping me.  I've also seen a decrease in the quality of help I receive.  I also find that it's harder to talk to people.  It's like they just aren't as comfortable around me and don't trust me as much.  It's hard to make friends compared to a few years ago.  People overall treat me neutrally and sometimes slightly negatively.  I've noticed strangers are more wary around me.  Nothing like pulling their kids away or clutching their purses harder, but they tend to stay at a farther distance and don't make eye contact with me as often (not that I mind, but it is something I've noticed).  

Final thoughts:

It was a jarring experience.  I went from being treated like how a person should be treated (trusted, listened to, etc.) to being treated, well, like a man.  In my experience I have been treated far worse as a man.  I by no means regret transitioning in any way, but I really wish someone would have prepared me for this.

Keep in mind, these experiences are my own.  For others it can be much different.  Additionally, I've only been a man for two years now so maybe that ""male privilege"" I keep hearing about will kick in sometime soon (that's a joke of course). That or I'll experience more and worse misandry, especially as I get further along in my transition and become even more masculine.",Griffin1102,t2_2tx2h1v3,0.94,335,127

576,oivkws,2021-07-12,MensRights,In Portugal the quality of the Covid vaccine you get depends on your gender.,"The vaccination of people under 50 against Covid-19 in Portugal created a massive gender divide in the whole vaccination process. Portugal announced that men in the 18-50 age group [would be getting the J&J (Janssen) vaccine while women would get only Pfizer and Moderna vaccines](https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2021-06-13/janssen-vaccine-now-recommended-for-men-over-18/60385). Astrazeneca vaccine is not given to that age group regardless of gender.

For those not acquainted with the different Covid vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have a [95%](https://www.janssencovid19vaccine.com/hcp/clinical-data.html) and [94.1%](https://www.janssencovid19vaccine.com/hcp/clinical-data.html) effectiveness respectively and nearly 100% effectiveness at preventing death or serious illness. Janssen vaccine on the other hand has [66% effectiveness in preventing moderate to severe disease.](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/01/29/961887796/johnson-johnson-vaccine-is-66-effective-in-preventing-moderate-to-severe-covid-1) The excuse given for the gender segregation was that most cases of blood clots from Janssen vaccine occurred in women. However the truth is cases were extremely rare on both genders and the European Medicines Agency has recommended it for both genders within that age group. Portugal chose not to follow that recommendation.

It gets worse, however. Currently [90% of infections](https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2021-07-07/delta-variant-responsible-for-close-to-90-percent-of-infections-in-the-country/60905) in Portugal come from the Delta variant. While Pfizer and Moderna vaccines (and most two-dose vaccines) have been proven to have [very high efficacy](https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-variant-covid-vaccine-effectiveness-protection-pfizer-moderna-astrazeneca-2021-7) against this variant, Janssen vaccine is thought to have little to no efficacy against it, similar to single shots of the remaining vaccines. This is concerning to the point that in the US [there are already Pfizer/Moderna booster shots being administered](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/booster-may-be-needed-jj-shot-delta-variant-spreads-some-experts-already-taking-2021-06-25/) to people who took the Janssen vaccine due to the Delta variant. Men in Portugal are being given a vaccine that offers little to no protection to the variant we have, and the government is aware of that.

Officially men in Portugal **can** be given the Janssen vaccine, but there is no official ""men get this, women get that"" rule. However such rule remains in practice in vaccination centers nonetheless.

Today I went to have my vaccine. I asked which one they were giving and of course it was Janssen. I asked whether they could give any of the others as this was the only vaccine I wasn't comfortable in getting.  Staff consulted with each other (all female staff) and afterwards with the nurse and claimed it was impossible, that they only had Janssen vaccine. This is of course a lie since there were plenty of women in my age group getting the vaccine there and currently women in this age group **cannot** be given Janssen vaccine at all unless they volunteer themselves. This means a vaccination centre that is accepting women cannot have the Janssen vaccine exclusively. In other words their response shows a de facto rule that men are given only Janssen vaccine is being enforced.

Quoting the official announcement, ***""this single-dose vaccine may also be administered to women aged 50 years or below ""who wish to do so, if duly informed, on a basis of weighing the benefits and risks"", provided they express their ""free and informed consent"".*** Once again, ""free and informed consent"" is a right men do not have as is the case in many other matters.

This comes added to the fact that men are very disproportionately killed by Covid-19, with a current mortality of 2.1% (9.016 deaths among 415.709 infected) compared to women's 1.6% mortality (8.148 deaths among 493.506 infected). It's no surprise that men are considered disposable in Portugal as is usually the rule everywhere else. In fact, when the number of workplace accidents went from 78% male to 69% male the national worker's union (CGTP) presented it as an ""aggravation of the gender inequality in work accidents"" [(Source in Portuguese)](http://www.cgtp.pt/images/images/2016/02/tendenciaacident.pdf), since male lives don't really matter.

>    Not knowing if a woman is menstruating (""ritual impurity"")

> I'm kind of horrified with these reasons. I understand it's because of religious values, but these values make me feel small and ashamed of myself. A handshake with me is not sexual. Any contact with my body is not sexual. It's not disrespectful to touch my hand.

> I would never in a million years force anyone to shake my hand, but just knowing these are the values behind some religious groups avoiding shaking the hands of the opposite sex makes me sad. I'm not trying to be insensitive or discriminate against any religion which is part of the reason I am declining to write what their religion is. This isn't me trying to attack any specific religion. This isn't even about the religion itself. It was just disheartening to read these values and slightly infuriating how a lot of the articles I came across frame it in this light hearted manner. I just feel like if you removed the aspect of religion these reasons would never be acceptable today.

My sole intention behind this post was opening a discussion on the sexist reasons behind this custom (which I listed in the post). I wanted to hear what others thought, I have never thought it would be okay to make these men (or anyone) shake my hand.

I don't want to take any action about it. All I did was some light research and then made this reddit post. I can't stress this enough I don't intend to make anyone shake my hand, I just want to hear other peoples' thoughts on the reason this custom exists.

> The two points I've seen in the comments that I thought were really interesting:

>    * Discussions about replacing gender with race / sexuality in this scenario - would that still make this acceptable in the work place?

>    * Gender discrimination is illegal in a workplace - so for those observing this religious custom the possibility of not shaking anyone's hand instead of singling out one gender.
> * I think this is a win win scenario for everyone involved and more sanitary overall.

578,iyiami,2020-09-23,MensRights,May have lost a job because I am male,"For context: I am a 25 year old male. Fresh out of grad school and planning to apply to physio school this year. I applied for a job as a physiotherapy assistant because with my kinesiology degree, minor in rehabilitation, years of relevant work experience, master's degree studying how pain effects movement, and being a certified personal trainer since I turned 18 I figured I should be plenty qualified to teach people exercises. I also thought it would help me get a good reference for physio school

I get an interview for the job and it goes great. They basically decide based on my resume that I'm a perfect fit before I even go to the interview. I go in and sign the paperwork and they tell me come in on Monday for training. They would like me to primarily be a physio assistant but also run to the front once in a while if there is a phone call or something. 

I walk in on Monday and the lady who runs the front desk who I am supposed to be shadowing tells me she is surprised that they hired me because, as someone who also has to do some work at the front desk, it's strange that they didn't hire a woman because women are so much better at it than men. Weird start but whatever. I spend the whole day working with her, learning how to bill people's insurance, greeting people as they come in, answering the phone, calling patients to make sure they didn't forget about their appointments, etc. I was attentive, I asked questions to clarify things, didn't make any mistakes, overall I thought I had a very good first day. She tells me come back in on Wednesday for more front desk training. Cool. 

Today they text me first thing in the morning and ask if I will come in an hour and a half early. Sure! I can do that! So I go in early and the head physiotherapist sits me down in one of the treatment rooms and explains that whoever is at the front desk is the face of the company. When people come in or call it's the first person they interact with and the person at the desk is responsible for keeping those clients coming back instead of going somewhere else. Without the right person at the front desk the business will fail. 

They decided that I am more than qualified enough for being a physiotherapy assistant and they bet that I don't even need any training I could just start. However, they need someone who is also good on the front desk so they have changed their mind and they will be hiring someone else instead and they sent me home. 

On my way out I tell the lady at the front desk that they said I'm not a good fit for working at reception and she reiterates that it's true because I'm not a female and laughs as I walk out the door. 

Did I just lose my job for being the wrong gender? I thought everything went so well especially since I was hired primarily to treat patients. Then I get called in and totally blind sided that I'm not a good fit for the position even though I thought everything went so well. Am I being overly analytical? Or did I actually just lose my job because I'm a man? 

TL:DR: Started a job as a physiotherapy assistant. Office manager makes a comment on my first day it's weird that they didn't choose a woman. Next day find out they changed their mind about hiring me and I'm fired",Thepolander,t2_xjcpj,0.98,397,55

Take part in a programme called 'Inspiring Girls' providing 100 girls across the city with a unique insight into business and higher education. Why? Because privilege? Or just because boys are a waste of space (/S)? What?,"Article from *The Guardian* Friday 03 February 2017:

>**Schools can raise girls' aspirations by partnering with businesses**

>*Students from disadvantaged backgrounds aren’t always aware of the opportunities open to them. We’re working to change this.*

>The absence of aspiration and understanding of opportunities that I see in some students from disadvantaged backgrounds – especially girls – is something I want to address directly. I believe the answer to the lack of female leaders within our society and businesses could partly lie with us in education, and we have found partnerships with the business community leads to stronger results.

Personally, I generally support moves that attempt to address widening social inequalities and attainment gaps in British society - and the idea of taking high school kids from disadvantaged backgrounds and showing them the kind of jobs that are not out of their reach and that they could one day actually do, does seem like one very good way of addressing that problem.

But as with any intervention, I would personally want to be sure that the problem has been correctly diagnosed before administering the solution.

So I was a tad dismayed to see this next paragraph:

>At both our academies, Whalley Range high school and Levenshulme high school for girls, we have been lucky enough to be involved in [the Inspiring Girls programme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNj4KfXQ3mg) – part of a Business in the Community initiative with Alliance Manchester Business School. Almost 100 young women from six high schools across Manchester have graduated from the programme this year. [We were particularly keen to get involved because it was an initiative that focused its efforts on encouraging girls of secondary school age to prepare for their futures](http://archive.is/PPISc).

Both those schools - Whalley Range high school and Levenshulme high school - are all girls schools only although whether that means the other four schools in the programme are all girls schools as well is not mentioned. If all six participating schools *are* in fact for girls schools only then that would seem to discriminate against girls in the area attending mixed high schools as well as - obviously - any boys.

And of course there are girls from disadvantaged backgrounds and those girls should absolutely be encouraged to perceive their futures as containing a far-wider range of options than they might currently believe they have access to.

But why does this programme seem to be exclusively aimed at girls in Manchester and North West of the UK? Why is a similar programme also running in [London](https://itfinspiringwomen.wordpress.com) and [other parts of the UK](https://vimeo.com/83024771) that, again, only focusses on girls? 

Why, in particular, is this programme only addressing the needs of young women when the following is *also* true:

>* [**Poor white boys get 'a worse start in life' says equality report**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34667100/poor-white-boys-get-a-worse-start-in-life-says-equality-report)

>* [**... why are poor white boys falling behind?**](http://archive.is/klRNz)

That last headline actually comes from *The Guardian*, by the way. And then there's this from the *Times Education Supplement*:

>[**GCSE results: Gender gap widens as girls pull further ahead**](https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/gcse-results-gender-gap-widens-girls-pull-further-ahead)

That article notes that while the the overall gap of ""8.9 percentage points – was wider than the 8.4 percentage points seen last summer and represents the biggest gulf since 2002, when girls were 9 percentage points ahead"" it also notes that:

> ... the gulf was narrower in the sciences with girls' results being only slightly better than boys in Physics (0.2 percentage points), Biology (1.6 percentage points), Chemistry (2.8 percentage points) and Computing (2.9 percentage points).

So even in STEM subjects - which we often hear things such as this - [Girls lack self-confidence in maths and science problems, study finds](http://archive.is/uFJt8) - girls are outperforming boys, even if only by a slender margin.

But despite all of that, that *Guardian* article from Friday 03 February 2017 continues:

>International Women’s Day in March last year marked the start of our year 9 students taking part. One of the activities included in the programme was a day of workshops hosted at the business school. The day allowed the girls to get an insight into university life, and life as a woman in business 

>[...] the students joined a range of optional workshops such as creative thinking, influencing people and personal branding, which were delivered by senior staff at the [Alliance Manchester Business School].

>[...] Just one day of mentoring was extremely valuable to my students, and allowed them to think and plan for the future. The girls were bubbling with enthusiasm throughout the day, which spilled over into their conversations back at school. The main things that seemed to surprised them was the amount of opportunities and the level of job satisfaction in the construction industry, as well as the fact that a number of the speakers had been the first in their family to go to university. The theme of working hard and with determination to achieve your dream was a prevalent one.

>Throughout the [Inspiring Girls] initiative I have seen a marked improvement in the students’ approach to work and their confidence in and outside of the classroom.

Like I say, it's not that I think girls from disadvantaged backgrounds should not be given opportunities such as these but when we live in a period where girls have been outperforming boys for over a decade and where poor boys - from black and Asian as well as white backgrounds incidentally - are experiencing particularly high rates of failure and all of the negative consequences that proceed from that - it seems positively obscene not to set up similar programmes for them.

If there are in fact any such programmes aimed at boys, please do let me know.

> To answer your question, here is a quote about some of the programs helping out boys in the UK and US. Of course more can be done but the point is that the ball is rolling.
"" Seventy-seven British universities, or about 45 percent of the total, report that they have programs to support men and young boys in general, the national Office of Fair Access reports; 51 of them, to help working class and white, black, and ethnic minority low-income boys in particular. There are fewer university efforts like this in the U.S.—but one example is a White House initiative called My Brother’s Keeper, is designed to lower crime and high-school dropout rates and improve college-going and employment prospects for black and Hispanic males.""

581,3ry91y,2015-11-08,MensRights,Crosspost from 2X - How the word of a woman has all but ruined my life.,"I recently came through an ordeal that could have ruined my entire life because I threatened to challenge the mother of my son for custody.

It started in 2014, when I found that the woman I was having casual sex with, while I was on vacation, was pregnant. I wasn't prepared for a child, emotionally or financially, but there it was - a positive pregnancy test from a woman I hardly knew.

As the pregnancy rolled forward, I relocated from Portland Oregon (where I lived) to Rapid City South Dakota, transferred my job, and my ""fling"" (We'll call her Jess) and I began spending more and more time together, getting to know each other. We were, after all, going to have to raise another human together.

It didn't take long for me to notice something that I found to be very bothersome: She had a drinking problem. Having friends and family who've fought addiction, I knew to broach the subject carefully and slowly - as gently as I possibly could. We were, at the time, only just starting to get to know each other. We met during the Sturgis Bike Rally which - if you're familiar with Sturgis - you know drinking rather common during the rally. I thought it was just her enjoying herself for the rally week. I was wrong.

At first, everything was perfect. She acknowledged to me that she had a problem and knew she had to quit (for the pregnancy, herself, and for the two other children she already had). I scheduled a counselor, for her - she said she'd feel more comfortable by herself for the first few times - So I paid the office in advance. . .

. . . Only to have her no-show. The office held my payment and, luckily, put it towards a future visit. That future visit never came. Days flowed into weeks and weeks pooled into months yet still she always seemed to have an excuse for not going to the meetings I'd scheduled.

Then she lost her job. It seems like the moment she lost her job was the moment my entire life changed. She moved in with me, I was paying her bills, supporting her and her children (I couldn't let the mother of my unborn son live out of a motel room). It was at this time she seemed to, for lack of a better phrase: lose her god-damn mind.

She was drinking regularly, daily, heavily - pushing 5 months pregnant - not working, relying completely on me. She'd be inebriated by the time I got off work, I could smell it on her breath, hear it in her voice, see it in her eyes - and she'd look me straight in the face and lie to me: No, I haven't been drinking. (I grew up with an Alcoholic father then spent 8 years in the US Navy - I can spot a drunk).

I was starting to panic - almost 4 months pregnant - still drinking almost daily (a small decline in the frequency and amount - but still often), so I turned to her family (Who I had only met several times prior) and asked them to help me with an intervention for Jess - I'm met with absolute disdain.

""Maybe if you didn't drink around her she wouldn't have such a difficult time! (I RARELY drink - and hadn't had a sip since finding out about the pregnancy) You don't know what you're talking about anyways, you're not a Doctor, you don't know that drinking while pregnant is bad."" (That, I shit you not, is a quote from her mother - her family, who live in the trailer-park, are an entirely different story).

Finally, frantic, I contacted the police after she became blatantly, belligerently drunk one afternoon - In the state of South Dakota, it is illegal to drink while pregnant. However the officers informed me that there was nothing they could do unless she committed a different crime which required them to administer a breathalyzer.
I was losing my mind. Watching this woman drink my unborn baby into oblivion and being absolutely helpless to stop it. Being forced to sit and watch as her mother would stop by and have a 6 pack, or a box of wine (""You can't even say anything about it this time - it's wine - and wine is good for pregnant women""), while smoking marlboro reds. Jess and I fought constantly. We argued about her drinking non-stop.

That's when, just shy of 5 months pregnant, at 3:30pm on a Wednesday, she got a DUI on her way back from the gas station to pick up another 6-pack.

Her mother bailed her out before sunset. I tried one last time to reason with Jess - to convince her to check herself into a Rehab facility - but her mother called the police on me and told them I was harassing her.

So I went to the States Attorneys office and was able to have an emergency commitment done. She was picked up and committed to rehab.

I wish the story ended there. She got out of Rehab - had a healthy baby boy - and was doing great. Not wanting to take a boy from his mother, I abstained on filing for custody. She'd gone through rehab, was on a post-rehab therapy schedule, was going to AA meetings - she got a job very quickly after having him, got into her own place - she looked to be doing great. The baby's 3 months old at this point: Things seemed to be looking up.

But she started to slip back into her same old routine. A beer with dinner every now and again, turned into a beer after work, turned into a few beers after work, turned into a 6 pack nightly in a matter of a month. I call her on it - and it turns into a fight. 

Everyday it's a fight. Everyday she's drunk and texting me. I ask to see my kid and she's telling me to try and take custody. I ask if I really need a lawyer and she dares me, tells me how she'll have me ""locked up so motherfucking fast"" if I try to take custody.

I saved several messages from her, threatening to have me arrested, threatening me bodily, calling me names - It was an every-day thing at this point. She'd get drunk before sunset and blowing up my phone before dinner. This goes on for a few months.

Getting to see my child was like pulling teeth. She was drinking nightly. She was seeing several different men, while leaving my son with her mother, and disallowing me the time we'd agree'd upon (she didn't want to go to court so, although I'd dropped a retainer fee, I asked the lawyer to abstain from initiating the custody proceedings as we were trying to work it out between ourselves - he told me that was a terrible idea - I should have listened).

Normally, I wouldn't mind if a woman left our mutual child with their mother - but her mother isn't ""normal."" As I said earlier - this is a woman who told me that I don't know that drinking while pregnant is bad because I'm not a Dr. Jess' mom also has no teeth. She owns a single-wide, 2 bedroom trailer in Sturgis SD, where she lives with her 3rd Husband who's couch-ridden/unable to move without assistance he's so obese, Jess' 32 year old ""Broken X Syndrome"" handicapped brother (it's actually ""Fragile X"" - but they call it broken X - I think it's really FAS), Jess' 30 year old sister and her Boyfriend (who also has lost most of her teeth) with her 4 different children by 3 different men (between the ages of 6 and 14), all of which are home-schooled and none of which can read (A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHO CANNOT READ!!!!!!!!).

Finally - the last time I get to see my son - she's drunk before 5 PM and insisting I come get my son, and if I don't she's going to call the police on me. I'm busy (on a date), it's not my day to pick him up, we've made no prior arrangements to pick him up - but I see him so rarely at this point, I jump at the opportunity. My date (luckily) doesn't mind and agrees to meet me back at my place for Netflix and Chill with my baby.

So I go to Jess' apartment to pick up my 5-6 month old son and find her apartment in SHAMBLES. My son has a cough so bad he needs a respirator when he sleeps. There are cigarette butts in and on the beer cans crowding every flat surface, in cups, on the floor. What little carpet was visible under all the clothes was stained and brownish. Several bags of trash were lined up against the wall as if they were just never taken out - their smell permeating with the thick layer of smoke that hung from the ceiling. Dishes everywhere. Filthy. Not just ""Unorganized"" or even ""Lived in"" - flat out filthy.

She wants to have sex. My son isn't even there. She insisted I come get my son so that I would go to her house in the hopes that she could seduce me. I declined her advances. She starts in on me. Hell hath no fury.

So - knowing I've got some strange waiting for me at my place, I tell straight up: I've had it. I'm seeing someone else, she's waiting for me to get back, don't worry about making time for me to see our son - I'll contact my lawyer on Monday and we'll go through the legal channels. I'm tired of fighting about it, I'm tired of worrying about him, and frankly, I'm disgusted with how you and your family live and I don't think it's safe or healthy for a baby.
She said ""Fuck you"" as I walked out of her door and headed to my car.

I got to my car, backed out, and was stopped by a police officer. He asked me what happened - I told him I came to pick up my son, my son wasn't here, his mom wanted to have sex, so I'm leaving instead.

He asks me to sit on the curb - I wait for about 10 minutes - then I'm arrested. Taken to jail. I asked the officer what I'd done and he said: ""Assault - you're going to jail."" That's all he'd tell me.
Finally my sister bails me out and I retain a lawyer. Only then do I find I'm being charged with Aggravated Assault Domestic Violence - a Class 3 Felony - for attempting to strangle my ex-girlfriend. I have no criminal history.

This all happened 7 months ago. I just finished my trial Thursday Morning. I missed my son's first birthday because of the Protection Order. I hear he's walking and talking now too. I haven't seen him in over 7 months. If I hadn't have had the foresight to save the DOZENS of threats she's made to me have me arrested, I'd probably be in SD State Penn right now. As it was - she claimed I strangled her 3 separate times (no visible marks - no medical aid) on the night I was arrested, testified to two separate times in front of a Grand Jury, then went to one prolonged rear-naked choke for my trail.

I have never once laid a harmful hand on a woman. Ever. Nor would I. However I was still arrested, forced to take at least a day every 2-4 weeks off for a court appearance or meetings with my lawyer leading up to trail. The Prosecution said, during ""Discovery"" they have ""No Tangible Evidence"" - Only Jess' Testimony. And the Testimony of a mystery person who turned out to be Jess' friend and flat out lied through her teeth.

Luckily, I was found ""Not Guilty."" All's well that ends well, no?
I have, however, developed an ulcer from stress and I'm struggling with depression - something I've never experienced before. My eating and sleeping habits have disintegrated into Eating and Sleeping spats - I no longer cook meals for myself. I just don't have the energy or motivation. I sleep for a few hours as soon as I get off work. I'm usually awake before sunset, all night, and through work the following day with a nap for lunch. I am 6'2, and 7 months ago I was 205lbs and healthy, in shape. I'm still 6'2, but I am a flabby 180lbs - and I don't care. I have perpetual black rings around my eyes - I don't care. I only eat food that requires a Microwave or a Toaster to cook. I don't even remember the last time I did a pushup, let alone go to the gym or do some calisthenics. I don't communicate with any of my friends - and because of the severity of the charges, the Mutual friends I had with Jess now think I'm an abusive monster - EVEN AFTER BEING FOUND NOT GUILTY.

My life, ME as a person, who I am, has been, essentially, altered for the worst, almost completely ruined, based solely on the word of an intoxicated woman. No tangible evidence. This is a woman who got pregnant at 14, dropped out of HS in 9th grade, who's had 2 DUI's, 2 assault charges, a Burglary Charge, and an ACTIVE WARRANT for her 2nd DUI in another state (which she jumped bail on). Based solely on her word, I was arrested, forced to spend thousands of dollars I don't have to defend myself, only to come out of this whole mess with next to no motivation to move forward with custody or even my life in general. I don't want to do anything. I want to sit here, in my dark room, alone, and stare mindlessly at the next article the interwebs have queued up for me until I decide to sleep.

""Not Guilty."" The judge said before he dismissed me. And that is that. It's all done. Except, somehow, she still gets free counseling for ""Victims of Domestic Violence"", still has custody of my son, and I've been labeled a monster by everyone who's heard her story - and I'm still the monster, just one that managed to get away with it (according to anyone who knows her).

Anyways - that's been the story of my 2015 so far. Pretty much the worst year of my life. Based solely on the word of a woman.

Thanks you for reading. I'm going back to sleep now.

583,16xhkk0,2023-10-02,MensRights,Men literally have to do everything in a relationship,"Have you guys noticed that for all these years men have been blamed if a woman can't orgasm? or if a woman doesn't know herself sexually, men get blamed for it. Not only we have to do the hard work of becoming a rare exception of a man to attract a woman, we have to learn of enough game to woo her, then the feminist want us to be responsible for their emotional health otherwise we are called ""emotional terrorist"" (Bell Hooks). Then we have to be their protector, and financially support them with six figures or more. 

They want us to do all of those thing while also wanting up to be expert in knowing how to please their own bodies when  a lot of the times even they don't know their own bodies. 

Some men are from the mindset that they don't care about a girl's pleasure at all. They have done the hard work of attracting them and getting them into the bedroom them orgasming is their own business. I don't disagree with this notion. It's the woman's responsibility to know what gets her off not the man's. 

It like they want us to be their boyfriend, their best friend, their personal bank, their therapist, their gynecologist, and so much more all wrapped into one man. 

They want to drain us until we have nothing left to give. This is why I refuse to give too much of myself to women anymore. I think it is time for men to be more mindful and cautious with how much time, energy, and money the give to women.",Neusprince,t2_bopbnfqd,0.89,471,138
584,yw7d4a,2022-11-15,MensRights,Man taken to court and is facing imprisonment because he tried to defuse a situation between two of his employees - a man and a woman.,"A woman is claiming sexual harassment from a work colleague. According to her this sexual harassment consisted of texts and other similar things. She said that she reported her colleague to her superior. Her superior tried not to escalate the situation. For his pains, she accused him too, and he is now facing criminal charges.

Compare this to what happened in a similar workplace. This story was not in the news but was recounted to me by someone who works in this workplace. A man complained to his superior that he was being sexually harassed by a female work colleague. Instead of trying to stop the situation, the superior reported the male victim to the police and the victim was taken to court and accused of making up a story against the female perpetrator.

I know the name of this woman but I do not know whether the rules in this sub allow me to write down the name.

Despite the fact that he's a difficult character and has routinely rubbed people the wrong way, for various reasons I rate him quite highly. While I'm not in a position to do anything about getting him extended or improving his reference (which isn't going to be great), I was going to try and broaden his experience by introducing him to different project teams.

586,a0mla9,2018-11-26,MensRights,Calling out the incels and woman haters on this sub. Go away.,"Years ago, I suffered through a traumatic divorce. I was raked over the coals for alimony, child support, had false accusations thrown at me by my ex-wife; the classic divorce story. Faced with losing custody of my own child, I frantically searched for answers which lead to my discovery of the MRA movement. I learned that there are thousands of men who face the same uphill battle every year - not only in the US, but all over the world. I remember crying my heart out in my lawyer's office and asking him why this was happening to me. His simply said, ""You're the victim of a poorly run society"". Those words continue to haunt me to this day, and that is what lead me to advocate for men's rights.

I occasionally check up on /r/MRA and several other subs, but I am often disgusted by the vocal minority of women-haters who feel that this is a place for people like them. I want to make something clear: **MRA is not about hating women, and if you do, then you are NOT a welcome part of this movement.** Many women support our cause, and that number is growing every day - as it should.

Many of us have wives, girlfriends, and active dating lives. We also have women in our families who we want to have the best lives possible. They are more than our loved ones - they are our allies. Yes, of course, there are many feminazi's who hate men, but they are as much of an exception to women as the neckbeards are to MRA.

If we are going to truly make the world a better place for men and boys, then we need to go mainstream. That will absolutely not happen if we allow the women bashing to continue. Calling women whores, gold-diggers, welfare queens, or otherwise demonizing them is not helping anybody. Further, it alienates women who would otherwise be potential allies, and gives the feminazis ammo to point at us and say ""SEEEEE?? WE TOLD YOU THEY'RE MISOGYNISTS!!! REEEEEE"".

**I challenge this sub...**

\- To call out the hateful comments

\- Approach emotional people (even feminists) with compassion and reason

\- To correct people who assume that MRA is anti-women

\- To show that equality for men will help women too

\- To not force your views on others

If we allow the hate to grow right under our noses, then we are only undermining our own efforts. Don't believe me? Then look at modern feminism. They never kicked out the feminazis, and now those slobs have become the mouthpiece of the feminist movement. If we don't become more palatable to mainstream voters and academics, then we will continue to be the victims of a poorly run society.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I suppose this thread has run its course. I appreciate those who came forward whether openly or via my inbox to express your support. It's a great feeling that so many of you share my thoughts about the flaws of our movement. I wish more of you felt it was acceptable to voice your opinions in the comment section, but your fear of reprisal speaks volumes about this sub. 

Before leaving, I just wanted to clarify a few things. First, incel is was not meant as a derogatory term; it's literally the name of the group I was addressing. They chose that name for their own subreddit. Second, I am disheartened by the defeatist attitude I've seen when having honest conversations with many of you. I fully realize the odds stacked against us, and that we have a very uphill battle ahead of us.

With that said, I will be parting ways with this sub. Not because of the hostility or differing opinions, but because most of you think there is no hope of a better future for men and boys. If you believe that we will never be accepted as a mainstream movement, or if you are afraid to sacrifice for this cause, then you have already lost. I can ignore your hostility and I welcome differing opinions, but I can't tolerate a losing attitude, so I'll be continuing the fight for men's rights on my own path.

  For those who don't know this is phone calls between Leticia Stauch and Al Stauch. Letecia was stepmother to Al's children and while he was out of town in the military on business she murdered his 11 year old son. Stabbed him 18 times and then bludgeoned him then shot him point blank. Then she reported him missing. These are phone calls where Al is working with the FBI and suspects Leticia is involved. She continually lies about what happened, continually gaslights him, continually switches the blame to be on him for not trusting her, emotionally explodes every time he asks a question. And this is behavior she has consistently shown throughout their relationship way before she ever murdered her step son. The way women usually abuse men is so different from the way men usually abuse women a lot of men don't even realize. A lot of people don't take emotional abuse seriously even though it's just as deadly and just as permanently scarring as other types of abuse. Because this type of emotional manipulation and gas lighting and exhaustion isn't portrayed in media or spoken about a lot of men don't even realize they're being abused. It's extremely sad. This isn't normal. It isn't normal for your partner to exhaust you emotionally, it isn't normal for your partner to lie to you. It isn't normal for your partner to steal from you. It isn't normal for your partner to blow up everytime you ask them a question or don't do what they want. It isn't normal to just give in to your partner so you don't have to deal with their emotional outburst. It isn't normal for your partner to refuse to take responsibility for their actions. It isn't normal for your partner to care about their own feelings more than yours. If you or someone you know see yourself or your relationship in this please seek help immediately. Plenty of women kill their partners or their partners children. Just because she hasn't physically hurt you yet doesn't mean she won't.

592,5emdsg,2016-11-24,MensRights,Workplace Violence Advice - maybe not what you think,"I approach you with a throwaway account for obvious reasons.   This seems to be a place that I can communicate my recent yet recurring issues in the workplace.  I'm not seeking emotional support, more of a question in how best to proceed given the circumstances.  I digress.  The details are as follows:

Medium sized business (<100 employees, work in an office of about 30, USA-Michigan) - 5 Months ago I was in my office when the female payroll clerk/HR person visited my desk as a result of not completing a task she requested on short notice as a result of other business priorities, in full knowledge and support of my superior.  My workspace is a typical ""L-"" shaped desk, with the short side of the L (and my back) leading to a wall.  This female co-worker was visibly upset over my inaction and through her course verbal confrontation over my inaction she came to my side and made physical threats to me to which I laughed at because she's not physically imposing: I'm over 6-foot tall and BMI obese but arguably physically stronger than her low 5-foot stature.  She took offense to this and crossed a physical boundary that I feel no employee should have to allow: she put both hands around my neck.  As a result I gracefully took my right hand and pushed her arms off of me - not aggressively, then I hesitantly laughed because though I felt no actual physical threat.  There were no witnesses.  As time went on, I became exceedingly upset upon recollection of how a fair workplace should function and brought this up to my supervisor, stating that it crossed a line that I would hope would never be crossed again.  My supervisor agreed in a manner that I felt was half-heartedly, given the circumstances I can understand because I'm generally non-confrontational.  No further events like this have happened between that coworker and myself since then.

Today I was punched in the arm by a different female coworker, a mid-50 year old larger woman in plain sight of the payroll clerk/HR person.  The actual punch had a lot more ""power"" than I was expecting.  She threatened additional violence.  I know that this is unacceptable.  I seriously thought about responding physically in the same way, but I didn't because again, I'm non-confrontational.  I am legitimately concerned that bringing this up to my supervisor will result in no preventative action and word getting around that I'm a complainer.
#
#
#
I don't have a lot of faith that reporting the action to my supervisor will change the environment where such violence between co-workers is acceptable.  I've thought about dealing with this directly with the battering co-worker who I've known as a co-worker for four and a half years and generally had a neutral or positive relationship with.  Fundamentally I think she's a good person who lost her temper.  But to put it simply, this shouldn't happen ever again.

Women complains that man keeping it professional at work makes her and other female coworkers feel uncomfortable","The other day I was bored and started doomscrolling on Reddit when I found this post on r/relationship_advice 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/10yx39j/a\_colleague\_at\_work\_27m\_of\_1\_year\_refuses\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10yx39j/a_colleague_at_work_27m_of_1_year_refuses_to/)

Essentially the post is about how some dude in the office (27M) won’t speak to OP (24F) and the other women at the office. He won’t talk with them about anything other than work with the girls, but is friends with the guys. However, he is cordial and will exchange some basic pleasantries (have a good day etc). In other words, he is being a normal coworker and OP doesn’t like that.

Now here’s the twist. OP said that one of the girls is considering go to HR about this because she is saying its creating a hostile work environment. This is the part that really pissed me off. Now I acknowledge that maybe the majority of women aren't like this, don't generalize blah blah blah I get it. However, it's not that every woman will, but that any woman can. This is the exact same situation as the google manager in a thread that got posted a while back where the guy got fired for not responding to a female coworker's advances. So the idea that this is an impossible scenario is simply false.

There is simply no winning anymore. Now if you follow the Pence rule, you can be punished for that to.   Act friendly with a woman and ask her out or show interest, and you get punished or fired for harassment. Okay. Men adapt. Now, you act professional with a woman, and her and her friends get upset that this is a hostile work environment and want to report this to HR. If a man does A he gets in trouble. If he does B he gets in trouble. If he reverses course and does Z or Y he gets in trouble as well. If he says f the system it's all BS and goes MGTOW, then he gets labelled incel, misogynist, sexist.

It is promising however that pretty much everyone in the thread called OP out for her total BS, but the simple fact that a group of women would even think to do this is just insane. I suspect (this is just my opinion) that the man is attractive, she showed interest, he says no thanks let's talk about work, and she takes it personally and builds a *hostile work environment* in her mind because she can't fathom that someone doesn't want to be best buddies with her *at work* and just wants to be professional. More attention-seeking bullshit. Nobody is entitled to friendship to anyone, but somehow this is too much to comprehend for some people. Imagine being so fragile that someone not being your best friend makes you feel uncomfortable. It honestly seems to me that she and the other girls at the office are harassing him. Rules for thee but not for me. I shoot you for no reason, but I am the victim.

Imagine if a group of guys went to HR and said, ""we feel upset that a female coworker at the office won't talk with us"". They would be annihilated. This is just complete delusion.

My wife and I have been non-monogamous for a few years but have had only a little experience dating others. It’s mostly a theoretical designation, and I would be fine with just a close platonic friendship with other couples. There’s been a lot of opportunities but I have not been excited about them because of one simple fact: the women I meet generally feel it’s ok to air out their issues with men in polite company. 

My understanding is that women would be offended if I interjected a social visit with my complaints about the women I’ve met, followed by a blanket statement about women. Who would do that? And yet, woman after woman after woman, does this regarding men! It’s striking to see the low empathetic capacity some women have for men, especially when they are apparently trying ‘to stop defining themselves by male needs.’ 

Is it something about me that draws it out of them? Do they take note of my social conscience and think ‘hey we have something in common’? If so, that’s doubly offensive because it doesn’t take any special effort to defend your own demographic. My social conscience is regarding systemic racism, not how men are all bad and should be supplanted with a woman in all possible scenarios. 

I had particularly high hopes for my current next door neighbors. They have an autistic child, I have autism, and the wife may also be on the spectrum. She even gave fairly unmistakable signals that she and her hubby would be open to swinging. But as we socialized I was sad to discover that this strange insistence of man bashing was not beneath her.

So now I’ve just given up hope that prevailing sentiments will shift in a fairer direction, and I’m just glad that I have a wife who is not a bigot.

Three men tried to take their own lives after false rape allegations were made by a 'fantasist woman' who lied about being abused by an Asian [**grooming gang**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/grooming-gangs/index.html), a court has heard.

Eleanor Williams, 22, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice earlier this year after accusing a number of men of rape and posting pictures on [**Facebook**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/facebook/index.html) claiming to show injuries sustained at the hands of a grooming gang. 

The post, made during the Covid [**lockdown**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/coronavirus-lockdowns/index.html) in May 2020, was shared more than 100,000 times online and sparked national outrage, leading to demonstrations in her hometown of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.

But she was found to have made it up, with a jury at Preston Crown Court finding her guilty of eight counts of doing acts tending and intended to pervert the course of justice in January this year.

On the first day of her two-day sentencing hearing, Mohammed Ramzan, a business owner who was accused of grooming Williams, told the court his life had been made 'hell on earth' by the allegations. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 

Mr Ramzan, who was in tears as he spoke from the witness box, said two weeks after he was arrested following Williams' claims he attempted to take his own life.

He said: 'I still bear the scars to this day.'

Mr Ramzan said his property had been damaged and his businesses had been 'ruined' after he and his family were targeted 'in the most horrendous way'.

He said: 'I have had countless death threats made over social media from people all over the world because of what they thought I was involved in.'

In a statement read to the court, Jordan Trengove said the word 'rapist' had been spray painted across his house and his window was smashed after Williams accused him of raping and attacking her.

After he was charged following Williams' claims, he said he spent 73 days in prison, where he shared a cell with a convicted sex offender.

He said: 'Things had calmed down a bit until the Facebook post in 2020.

'This made things even worse for me. There were big protests and marches in Barrow.

'The lowest point was when I tried to end my life in August 2020.'

And a second man, Oliver Gardner, said his chance encounter with Williams in Preston led to him being sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

You will be given no chance to defend yourself. Testimony from other parties proving your innocence is irrelevant.  

No matter what lengths you go to in order to make sure you are covered in the event of a false allegations is also irrelevant.

I have 3 teenage daughters. I was raised by a single mother. I respect everyone until they individually acted in a way that does not warrant that level of respect.. Men, women, somewhere in the middle it doesn't matter. Specifically in the workplace. 

I know where the lines are. I do not text female coworkers from my personal phone. If I have to text them outside of standard business hours, I use my work phone. 

Before I send a text, I take the time to think how each text could be interpreted when all context is removed. This applies to emails, face to face interactions, everything. 

I make a point to never to be alone with female coworker. Ever. Whether it's a corporate sponsored event or not, I never want to be in a he said/she said situation. Err on the side of caution. Always.  

The MeToo movement reemphasized the importance of being extra conscious with regards to women in general, specifically women coworkers. Especially when you are in a position of leadership. 

Turns out, none of that matters. 10+ years without so much as a blip on HRs radar, I was terminated for inappropriate behavior. I was accused of telling my administrative assistant I was going to fuck her. The event where I allegedly said  this, I didn't even attend. Come to find out (because I have friends in HR as well as friends that work with her husband) her husband thought we were ""getting to close"" so he told his wife to either get me fired, quit, or he was going to kick her out. He even went and bragged about it to people he apparently did not know I knew.   I will get to how this had already come back to haunt him in a bit. 

In the end none of it mattered. I was terminated on the spot. No severance, no pension, just ""mail us all your equipment and fuck off"". 

Luckily the industry I work in is huge, but very tight-knit. Word traveled fast despite HRs best efforts to say I was terminated because I did not agree with the RTO policy. (There was no RTO policy)

I'm not trying to toot my own horn, but I am well known in the industry. Just about everyone (thay matters) saw through this the moment they caught wind of it and since my non-compete and non-solicit were voided, it ultimately turned out to be a blessing in disguise, but I am still having trouble getting past 1 thing.

How can a man with a spotless record, multiple testimony from others that not only I would never say that but I WASNT EVEN AT THE EVENT THIS ALLEGEDLY TOOK PLACE get terminated because of a single unsubstantiated allegations?

When I read stories about professional athletes of celebrities who were ultimately blacklisted due to false allegations I always thought surely there is more to the story. 

Not anymore. 

TL,DR; I am struggling to come to terms that your career, character, integrity can be destroyed by a single allegation. Everything else is irrelevant.  Proof you weren't at said event means nothing. If a woman accuses you of something in the workplace or not. Corporate sponsored event or not, you're done. 

Imagine how that conversation went with my daughters? Without a doubt the hardest thing I have done in my life even though they know I do not act or talk that way. 

How do you come to terms with this and ultimately get past it? Frankly, I am terrified to work with women. I work in a male-dominated industry, but my point still stands. No matter what lengths you go to to insulate yourself from potential allegations, it ultimately doesn't make a difference. 1 accusation of saying something I didn't say at an event I have proof I never attended is all it takes. 

How do you accept this and move forward? 

I have accepted a number of harsh realities in life, but this one is really giving me problems. I honestly don't know what else I can do to prevent this from happening in the future.

610,eq8x4a,2020-01-18,MensRights,"Why feminism is toxic, from a woman."," To be clear, I specifically mean ""third wave feminism."" The two first forms of feminism (first being getting women to vote and some other rights, second being about freedom to do what you want with your life) are, in some cases, fine.

I'm a woman, relatively attractive, and I want to talk about cat calling. **Simply said, there is nothing wrong with cat calling.** Never has been, never will be. I've never had a single woman explain to me why men making moves on women is wrong. Ever.

And catcalling is probably the softest form of hitting on a woman there is.

So, why are feminists against it?

Simple.

They never get catcalled.

I dare you to find ONE even semi-attractive self-proclaimed ""feminist"" these days. Go on, I'll wait.

The fact is, those ""feminists"" never get catcalled. Because no one hits on them. Because no one finds them attractive. Sure, they sometimes find some loser jerk desperate for company and attention (see: men who date feminists), but for the most part, they're alone.

They envy women who can date actually attractive men. Men with a life, men who workouts and have a nice body.

So, if they don't get catcalled at all, what's the next step? Ban it!

**""If I don't get catcalled, then no one will.""**

That's the extend of their logic right there. **If they can't get it, then no one will.**

The fact is, today, there is almost no reason for feminism to exist (at least in the United States / western world). Women pretty got everything they wanted. In fact, it could be said women are now considered SUPERIOR to men. I've worked with women and still work with women and I can say that women either earn the same OR more than me, and in the vast majority of cases, work less than men.

Simply said, the vast majority of women don't want to work. They get comfy positions where all they have to do is answer some e-mail, prepare some Powerpoint for a meeting and write useless reports no one will ever read. They work in call centers and prattle with coworkers all day while men have to take calls in.

Even those who DO want to work, and I mean the tiny majority that want a career and all that, end up working less hard than men. Simply said, women will never have the drive and energy men have. Yes, there might be a few women who do, but it's incredibly rare. In my entire life, I've never met a women that was a hard-worker.

They THINK they do, but they simply aren't as productive as men. I'm even talking physical, I'm talking intellectual. They are slower, they get distracted more easily, they are more prone to talking and wasting time, etc etc etc. To be fair, it's not completely the woman's fault: even if she is 100% into it, her body will sometimes dictate when she can and cannot work. Cramps, menstruation, hormones, etc. Now with pure will you can overcome that, of course, but even with the most motivated woman ever, it's hard.

Thus, women are allowed to work less than men, yet earn the same. Now there IS some discrimination against women still going on the work system, but it's very small.

All this to say that feminism serves no purpose whatsoever right now. So these people need to FIND a purpose. And like leftists who fake hate crime so they have a reason to organize a protest, feminists invent reasons to feel ""oppressed."" I get catcalled? That's oppression.

At its core, feminism is about ugly women realizing they wasted their life and dragging down other women to comfort themselves. ""I failed at sleeping with hot guys... But it's not because I'm fat, lazy and stupid, it's because of the *system*."" These people lie to themselves to get their lives meaning. ""I date a loser and I'm secretely jealous of that girl dating a good-looking guy... But that girl is getting oppressed! I'm free from XYZ thanks to feminist!""

There's more to it, but I needed to say all that. Always remember the only reasons feminist think catcalling is wrong is because no one catcalls them and it makes them jealous. If they can't have it, then no one will. If feminists spent even half the time they spend bitching about men improving themselves instead, they would probably get catcalled too, and not be against it so much. But they won't, because they are lazy and their lives are a failure.",throwawaysexslutt,t2_4qlzqlgb,0.75,68,40

>Women prisoners must not be full-searched as a matter of routine but only on intelligence or reasonable suspicion that an item is being concealed on the person which may be revealed by the search. Full searches must be conducted in accordance with the correct procedures. The procedure for searching women prisoners is different to that used to search male prisoners and women visitors and staff.  (p16)

&#x200B;

>An appropriate manager must authorise the full search of a woman prisoner in the case of a “target search”, i.e. not following reception, a visit or a cell search, where time allows prior authorisation to be obtained. (p34)

&#x200B;

Men can be searched naked, made to squat, bend over, lift his genital and pull his foreskin, etc. Women can be searched naked only if there are high suspicions

&#x200B;

>A women must never be asked to squat. (p34)

But even male visitors can be asked to. They dont need the same level of suspicion to get male visitors naked and squatting. But don't worry when men are asked to squat it is recorded ! And male visitos can only asked to lift their genitals or his foreskin only he there are suspicion. How merciful of them.

&#x200B;

(p7-11)

Even E-level (women who attempted an escape) and restricted (high security level) female prisonsers are not routinely full strip checked but every male have to be. (p12). By restricted I mean :

&#x200B;

>Those whose escape would be highly dangerous to the public or national security, thus necessitating maximum security conditions. Offences that may result in consideration for Category A or Restricted Status include \[attempted\] murder, manslaughter, \[attempted\] rape, sexual assault, armed robbery, wounding with intent, kidnapping, importing or supplying Class A controlled drugs, possessing or supplying explosives, offences connected with terrorism and offences under the Official Secrets Act

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner\_security\_categories\_in\_the\_United\_Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_security_categories_in_the_United_Kingdom)

Another male only thing (p40-41) :

>If there are grounds to suspect (e.g. from CCTV footage or intelligence or from the way the prisoner is behaving during a full search) that a male prisoner has an item hidden in the anal area or hidden in the genital area then a closer visual inspection must be undertaken as part of a full search.

&#x200B;

>A male prisoner must be asked to bend/squat. Officers will then be able to visually examine the area more closely, using mirrors if necessar

&#x200B;

>If the prisoner refuses to bend/squat he is disobeying a lawful order and, if appropriate, reasonable force can be used to make him bend/squat, or alternatively mirrors can be used to search the anal/genital area

&#x200B;

Now look at this (p25-27) :

* Female prisoners, visitors and staff must only be searched by female staff.
* Male visitors, prisoners and staff may be rubbed down searched by male or female staff, but must only be full searched by male prison officers.
* Where a female member of staff objects to rub-down searching a male, managers must make reasonable adjustments to ensure that they do not have to carry out the search. It is usual for female members of staff to rub down search males unless the man has a genuine religious or cultural objection to this.
* Exemptions for male prisoners will only be permitted when the male prisoner has genuine grounds for objecting to being searched by a female member of staff. It is not sufficient that the prisoner would prefer to be searched by a male member of staff. In practice it is likely that prisoners will only be able to establish good reason for an exemption in cases where the practice has caused genuine distress.

There are more care for a female staff who doesn't want to search a male prisoner than when a male prisoner refuse to be searched by a female one.

&#x200B;

Not only female are receiving favorable sentences under government policy ([https://www.gov.uk/government/news/secretary-of-state-launches-dedicated-strategy-to-break-the-cycle-of-female-offending](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/secretary-of-state-launches-dedicated-strategy-to-break-the-cycle-of-female-offending)) but in prison their are treated as sub humans.

&#x200B;

EDIT : The procedure is so complex for men to refuse a female staff. They really do their best so that women's ego are not impacted by being refused or that creepy women are not deprived of the privilege of groping men.

&#x200B;

>If there are situations where a male prisoner objects to being searched by a female member of staff on grounds of religion those situations must be referred to the Managing Chaplain and relevant faith Chaplain or, where necessary, to Chaplaincy HQ where advice can be obtained from the National Faith Adviser for that religion. If the Faith Adviser indicates that this is an important aspect of the religion then an exemption on grounds of religion should be granted. Otherwise an exemption on cultural grounds (see below) may be considered.

&#x200B;

>On Cultural Grounds: Some male prisoners may have genuine objections to being searched by a female member of staff on cultural grounds. A cultural ground means an objection that arises from a sincerely and deeply held belief.

&#x200B;

>If a prisoner asserts reliance on this exemption he will need to be able to: (a) explain what the sincerely held belief is; (b) set out the reasons why he holds that belief; (c) explain why that belief means that he objects to a rub-down search being performed on him by a female member of staff. In many if not all cases, it is to be expected that the prisoner will be able to demonstrate that being searched by a female member of staff will be a cause of genuine distress.

&#x200B;

>A mere preference to be searched by a male officer will not be enough to constitute a sincerely and deeply held belief. Similarly reasons which are frivolous, or are intended to frustrate the efficient running of the prison, should be rejected.

Women who killed someone or tried to escape cannot be searcher without authorization. But for sake of efficiency, men should shut up if they do not want to be searched by a woman.

&#x200B;

>It may be difficult to confirm the veracity of any cultural objection based on sincerely held beliefs. Probation reports and/or consultation with the prisoner’s offender manager, personal officer or wing staff may be of use. If the prisoner has made the request in writing, it might be helpful in addition to talk to him in order to confirm that the reason relied on is genuine and deeply held.

&#x200B;

>The request must be considered by a member of staff delegated by the Governor as competent to carry out the task. The member of staff delegated to consider exemptions must make reasonable efforts to determine the veracity of the request.

&#x200B;

>Prisoners must be advised that their exemption will be kept under review and, should evidence emerge that they have deliberately misled staff in order to gain the exemption, then the exemption can be withdrawn

&#x200B;

>Where staff are unsure if a prisoner has an exemption or not then the prisoner should be believed and checks made later. Prisoners who deliberately mislead staff by pretending to have an exemption may then be subject to a disciplinary charge (appropriate charge Prison Rule 51 (6), YOI Rule 55 (7) intentionally obstructs an officer in the execution of his duty, or any person (other than a prisoner / inmate) who is at the prison / young offender institution for the purpose of working there, in the performance of his work).

They even charge you for something as minor as lying to not get groped by women.

It is clear for me:

**As a male prisoner, being treated with dignity, respect and basic decency is a hard earned privilege. As a female prisoner, not being treated as a queen is a capital offense. Male prisons are the perfect place for female creeps to abuse men. We don't send female abusing men and boys in prisons. But we send female abusers in prisons so  they have an easier tiùe abusing men.**

It is time we men wake up. Stop caring about women. Do like feminits. Only care about men and boys. Only push policies and laws for men. No matter if it could benefit women too. Feminists fight to reform prison for women only.  They will straight up  do things, create policies and laws only for women, simply for the sisterhood. Time for us to fight for the brotherhood. 

Want to do charitable work with prisoners ? Only do it with men. Want to implement new rules and policies in prisons and justice system to help criminals ? Fight to implement it only for men and boys. Want to make donations ? Give only to men and boys. Want the government to add new services, support or methods in prisons, military, school, universities , etc ? Lobby only for men and boys. Same if you want more funds or more attentions to a certain issues : Petition on the issues but in the that the attention and funds are focused on men and boys.

Even gender neutral charities are for female privileges. We can't keep going like that. We have women fighting for themselves and men fighting for people. Society is built on the back of men sacrificing and denying their own worth for the benefit of women. We have to stop. 

Edit 3 :

Men need to understand : Women are shareholders of the society. Men the low qualified, expendable and replaceable workers of society. Women wait comfortably getting the fruit of men's sacrifice. Men don't get a share of the fruit of  their labor. Men don't gain anything by hard working and investing in society. Women are the one who harvest the benefits. It is time we start acting as workers : do the minimum and demanding benefits only for ourselves if they want us to keep working to maintain society.

Selfishness and tribalism is the only thing that can save men and boys. Feminists always accuse men to be biased toward men, to make every place a ""boys club"". Let's prove them right.",SamaelET,t2_711hdpbk,0.96,787,36

If a woman fails another woman, it's a tragedy, but if a man fails either, he's criminally liable.","And this comes down to our biology, for the same reasons men typically form both the most incarcerated per-capita *and* the wealthiest individuals in a nation:

*because it's fucking* *~~expected~~* ***DEMANDED*** *of us* (by both genders).

Men form both the bottom rungs of things like poverty and criminal incarceration (along with 4x the successful suicide rates) *and* the upper echelons of society (millionaires and tycoons).

This ""worst of the bottom, best of the top"" mentality is *constantly* pushed on men (throughout any time period), and can be seen in areas of conflict and danger like the military and police, both of which exist as a means of tempering ""toxic masculinity"", yet altogether continue to insist that men exist not just to keep women safe, but to police other men through violence, force, and other elements of ""toxic masculinity"" (placed with a neat little collar around its neck) that somehow becomes less toxic when it's ""your backyard"" or ""your man"" (he had a family, after all), so long as enough scared women demand it (while also ignoring how, statistically, men are the victims of male violence more frequently than women).

Meanwhile, nowhere will you find a commonly accepted equivalent (that incurs no penalties in polite, PC society) of phrase like ""dude bros"" that can (just as commonly without offending) be used to describe women who don't express an interest in the opposite gender and whom (seemingly) are content to enjoy the company of their own gender.

I.e., even *casual* demonstrations of ""men acting like men"" are ridiculed, while a group of ""real men"" is seen as the equivalent of a Mongolian horde (or Canadians at a hockey game), leaving us, again, with ""no real out"" other than to act stereotypically confident, machoistic and, to reiterate, *maintain the status quo of* ""oh yeah, I'M not one of those bad men! I can police other men I demean as 'lesser' AND pay taxes!"" (or otherwise be ""at risk"" of not being one of the upper 20%, since you're still ""grey in the middle"").

620,16o0a6c,2023-09-20,MensRights,Full List of Deficits in Male Human Rights,"This is split into two categories: negative rights and positive rights. It doesn't include any numbers because it varies from country to country, but despite the variance, almost every statement is true for each 'Western' country (all statements are true for the US). Let me know if there's anything missing, doesn't belong, or can be better stated.

&#x200B;

**Deficits in Negative Rights**

*(Negative rights compel the inaction of others to prevent the violation of life, liberty, and property, and by extension compel due process and non-discrimination when those rights are potentially abdicated for penal consequences.)*

Right to Life (murder, bodily/genital mutilation, torture)

* forced prepuce amputation (child circumcision).
* forced prepuce defusion (pre-pubescent foreskin retraction).
* no right to self-defense against women's domestic violence.
* forced military conscription.

Criminal & Civil Courts

* fully prejudicial administration of the law:
   * far higher rates of arrest, charges/prosecution, conviction, incarceration, and registration of males for the same crimes; and lower rates for both male and female perpetrators when victims are male.
   * far longer lengths of male incarceration and registration for the same crimes; and shorter lengths for both male and female perpetrators when victims are male.
* little/no protection from physical violence, sexual assault, or rape by a woman.
   * violation of a man's sexual capacity (non-consensual envelopment) is legal in most countries; and almost never prosecuted where it is illegal.
   * violation of a man's reproductive capacity (pregnancy entrapment) is completely legal.
* privacy/anonymity for accuser and publicity for accused regarding sexual crime accusations; no comparable punishment for accuser nor restitution for accused if proven to be fabricated.
* no statute of limitations, or decades-long periods at best, for accusations of sexual crimes.
* extreme prejudice in determining the domestic abuser and degree of abuse; automatically guilty w/no conviction, evidence, or charges required for domestic violence accusations.

Family/Domestic Courts

* reproductive rights:
   * pregnancy concealment (man is unaware he conceived).
   * pregnancy entrapment (aka fraudulent conception).
   * paternity deception (aka illegitimate pregnancy).
* parental rights:
   * prohibited from parental surrender while women have several means of surrender.
   * often prohibited from paternity testing (right to parental certainty).
   * no legal say in preventing adoption (in some US states).
   * extreme child custody gap.
* property rights:
   * paternity fraud (the usual result of paternity deception).
   * extortionate child support, often for non-biological 'fathers.'
   * extortionate and protracted spousal support (alimony/palimony).
   * immediate, forced, and permanent eviction of man with total property transfer to woman after domestic violence accusations via protracted restraining orders.
* due process rights:
   * prejudicial law and administration of the law; revolves around mother-worship.
   * presumed guilty of most charges and subject to double jeopardy for domestic violence accusations.
   * incarceration for men unable to fully pay child support (debtors' prisons – failure of limitations on contempt power).

&#x200B;

**Deficits in Positive Rights**

*(Positive rights compel responsibility and non-discrimination in the actions of people, organizations, institutions, and governments which determines the relative care, protection, assistance, and opportunities one receives and determines the disproportionate rates of certain illegal rights violations. Also included are some disparities in life outcomes.)*

Child Care

* lower adoption rate
* higher rate of abusive head trauma
* far higher rate of neglect-induced psychopathy

* public offices for better education of females, but not males

Work

* far higher injury and death rates
* discriminatory hiring and promotion
* misandric dispute resolution
* less paid parental leave
* older retirement age

Finance

* special privileges for female-run businesses
* special tax-exemptions for women (equivalent of a man-tax)

* male sports leagues made to subsidize women's sports leagues

Housing

* far more homelessness, especially chronic and street homelessness
* far less homeless shelter space per homeless man
* special housing assistance programs for women, but none for men

Male Spaces

* women allowed in certain male sports leagues while reverse is disallowed
* common female intrusion into locker/changing rooms of men and boys
* female imperialism and intervention in predominately male spaces
* reduction and retrofitting of neutral spaces into female-only spaces
* appropriation of time periods to make neutral spaces female-only

Domestic Abuse

* higher proportion of battery victims
* far higher proportion of general abuse victims
* almost no domestic abuse shelters
* public offices to reduce domestic abuse against women, but not men

Physical Harm

* multiple times more victims of physical assault
* multiple times more victims of homicide
* customary targets of gender-specific mass killing
* vast majority of war-related injuries and deaths
* public offices to reduce physical violence against women, but not men

Sexual Harm

* vast underreporting and dismissed reports of sexual assault and rape
* no social services for rape victims, despite comparable prevalence
* no social services for genital mutilation victims, despite extreme prevalence
* public offices to reduce sexual violence against women, but not men

Suicide

621,6i3pkf,2017-06-19,MensRights,"Just typed this out on another thread thought I would share, my experience being hounded out of an all female office","So l worked in an all female workplace. I was marketing and communications manager for a nonprofit with a staff of 11. I did social media, desktop publishing, graphic design, web, light IT, anything to do with marketing. The new black female ceo came in and harassed me about everything she could take issue with like being ""intimidating"" because I'm tall. 


After three years of exemplary performance under the previous ceo they eventually fired me for leaving work 15 minutes early and called it ""job abandonment"" and denied me unemployment and hired a female to replace me. She lasted a few months since she couldn't do the job and they hired another woman I went to school with who was totally incompetent. 


I tried to get out before the fired me since I knew they were trying to pressure me out. I interviewed for a similar position at the nearby university but they hired one of my boss's middle age Hispanic female colleagues over me and the black female who interviewed me told my boss I interviewed for the spot. The Hispanic female they hired instead of hiring me called me a week later to ask me ""how to do what I do."" Of course there was no reason for me to teach her how to do a job she should have known how to do to get hired in the first place nor could I teach her in a phone conversation what took me years of work and study to learn. They fired me about a week later. 


Incidentally I set up my email to forward to the new ceo before I was removed from the system after asking on my way out if they wanted me to do that as we had with other employees who had quit and they said yes then the new ceo called the police because I was ""harassing her"" with thousands of emails...from a company account I was not in control of that was set up to forward under her instructions. Because of my job I handled dozens of accounts for various platforms and software and got probably 100 emails a day, like analytics reports and such. My favorite part was near the end when her Outlook needed to be fixed she left the calender open on the desktop and it said ""make [myname] f up"" for a day that week.  

Then she trashed my name all over town so nobody would hire me. I tried to be a stay at home dad and my wife and I broke up. Haven't seen my kid in 3 years. Thanks for making the workplace more diverse. I used to be a liberal.",drgk23,t2_s8xnk,0.93,71,24

623,1agyoot,2024-02-02,MensRights,My Son is a Domestic Violence Victim,"My son is 27 yrs old. He was in a relationship with a woman for nearly a year. It started to go south late in the Fall, and since that time he was battered on multiple occasions. I’ll address a couple specific incidents so you understand the level of abuse.    

In one incident my son got himself ready for work and left the house. She must have heard the door close. She ran outside directly from the shower, completely naked, shampoo in hair, and started blocking his car with her body, screaming the whole time. She is irrationally jealous and accused that he wasn’t going to work but rather to see another woman. Once he opened the car door, she started punching and kicking him. He closed the door, tried to leave again. Blocked again. Called 911. Officers were dispatched. She admitted what she did, the blocking and the violence and told the officer she has mental health issues. No arrest was made. 

Incident 2 was this past weekend. Once again, when he needed to get going she attacked him. This time head butting, pulling hair and beard, repeatedly grabbing his legs trying to get him on the floor, kicked him in the genitals, scratched him several times, split his lip. There was some destruction of his property as well. She locked him in the garage. He couldn’t get out. He called 911. officers were dispatched. She was questioned about having someone in the garage. She admitted she did and opened the door. She also admitted the violence that my son had described to the police. She was not arrested on site. A detective contacted my son on Monday to know if he would like to follow through with seeing her charged, would he be a cooperating witness. The detective then advised he would forward the report to the prosecutor, who would decide whether to charge.    

There have been several incidences where she has punched him, slapped him, scratched him, destroyed his property, and blocked him from leaving the home. He has made 3 police calls in total.     

Let me say my son bears some responsibility because he continued to go back to her. Like most domestic violence victims, he loved his abuser and kept hoping that things would get better. That whichever incident would be the last time.    

I’m writing today because as a woman and a mother of a son, I never thought I’d see my child get caught up in the abuse cycle of domestic violence. Somehow I imagined that’s something you have to worry about if you have a daughter, but not a son. I’ve been an advocate for men’s rights since I found out I was pregnant with a boy 28 yrs ago. I’ve learned so much on the topic over these many years and yet this escaped me. It never occurred to me that my son would be a victim of domestic violence, even though I know it happens to men as well.     

What can we as a society do to encourage parents to talk to their sons as well as their daughters about the dangers of domestic violence?  I am fully aware that we have precious little in the way of resources for men who are victims. This is also something we need to address. But I’m just trying to focus on how we could make sure the parents are having the talk with and watching for the signs of abuse in their sons.    

I’ll just wrap this up by saying that I’m devastated. I’m brokenhearted for my son and what he had to endure. It very clearly was handled differently because the victim here is a male. My son had a very keen awareness that if he defended himself, he would likely be the one to go to jail. My son was given a victims rights sheet, but no information about a shelter, or a number he could call if he needed to talk to someone, or follow up from a special division within the police department that is devoted to domestic violence. There are basically no resources available to him as a victim of domestic violence in our area. As his mother, I just let him talk about his feelings surrounding all this as much as he wants. I listen and I validate that the behavior this woman showed him was absolutely wrong and unwarranted. It’s all I know to do. I’m open to any feedback about how I can support him.

I was tasked with recruiting for my city’s office this year for our junior Associates that start next year, which gave me great insight as to how much of an advantage a woman has in recruiting for a coveted spot at a prestigious firm.

First off, diversity recruiting has nothing to do with race anymore, only gender. There is almost no socioeconomic diversity amongst candidates anymore - they are all from affluent/wealthy families, all went to an 8 Schools boarding school or elite NYC prep school, all went to Harvard/Yale/Princeton/U Penn/Stanford/Columbia/Oxford, and all came from the same five elite investment banks. Point is, we aren’t changing any of these candidates lives in any meaningful way economically.

We had narrowed down 100 candidates to a pool of 25 candidates for 5 seats, and our target was 3 men and 2 women out of 20 men and 5 women. 

After we interviewed all of the candidates and reviewed their technical exam, we had an all hands call to discuss who we were going to give offers to. We said to cut down the bottom 25% of the technical exam (which had blind scoring) and then we would review the remaining candidates. When we looked through the list and picked the definite offers (4 guys really crushed it), we realized we had a problem, all of the women scored within the bottom 25% of the test. In fact, there was a LARGE gap between the top-scoring woman and the bottom-scoring man. 

We were then stuck on the call for an hour trying to figure out which woman would make the best to fill that one seat even though they all had a black ball against them from the in person interviews from being ill-prepared (from other women at the firm, not just my male colleagues). We had to overlook several well-qualified men to fill and seat with an unqualified woman, which just pisses me off.

She begins to become annoyed with my refusal for her offer, I explain to her that I am homosexual and that I am taken by another man; she walks away sighing.

Around a week before I graduated, she proceeds to follow my boyfriend to the male toilets, then she shouts at the top of her lungs ""This guy and his partner tried to force a three-some on me"" then screams in terror.

A tutor runs towards the ""crime"" and she just explicitly keeps saying ""they r*ped me"" over and over again with no details at to what might have happened. Note that I was nowhere near there but my boyfriend texts me to come to the scene.

If this doesn't already add up to you, it gets worse, this horrible woman then begins to say that I should be jailed for not coming to her rescue... notice the inconsistency yet?

All of us immediately went to the principal's office, where they had  pulled some CCTV tape, it played, revealing that she had completely staged the incident. She begins to cover her head up... possibly because it was already proven that it was a completely false accusation.

Without going into detail I was told by a female, of the same age, same role and position of authority that I couldn't do a particular job because ""boys get distracted.""

The issue I have is that after speaking with friends and even family members seeking advice on what I should do, I've been told; Don't make trouble, it will jeopardise your career, don't stir the pot, you don't want to get on her bad side. Amongst other comments to discourage me standing up for myself. If the tides were turned and I said to her ""I don't want you parking cars because girls cant park"" it would be seen has an abhorrent and sexist comment.

I'm not upset about what she said but rather the atrocious hypocrisy of any equal opportunities or feminist movements that seek silence men into submission. Why should I be denied doing my job because of a woman's outrageous bigotry? I am disgusted by the culture that has been brewed that says that if a man is victim of discrimination he must suffer in silence. Let those comments wash over him. If I have any integrity for myself or indeed others, man or woman, that experience discrimination I should be able to stand up for myself. How can I take others seriously if I am not allowed to take myself seriously. Does not this kind of culture just perpetuate the problem further? Wouldn't you think the stereotype of a man would be to stay strong and fight!  Not submit and accept a disadvantaged position because of their sex. 

Is there anyone else out there that has been put in this type of situation? Forced to stay silent for fear of being seen in tainted light. What did you do? What ramifications did you experience? 
 
Unfortunately, I have decided I must let those comments wash away and let my success and ability speak for themselves. However, it only pains me. I am sure instances of this are not exclusive and surely contribute to the already terrifying high rates of young male suicides. ",MarsRover94,t2_rbp1z,0.98,164,21

I wanted to see mensrights perspective too,"Also posted on [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9oc484/i\_am\_woman\_and\_i\_am\_offended\_by\_this\_metoo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9oc484/i_am_woman_and_i_am_offended_by_this_metoo/)

First, i think this is only a media & elite drama used to victimize woman more than empower her.

The tweet started as "" If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet "" and slowly migrated towards interpretation of ""Believe the woman"".

How many of the 99% got justice because of metoo ?? None.

How many of 1% elites got justice of metoo ? Just a few.

BUT the consequences to society have been more bad than good.

When woman (also me) are automatically privileged to statement despite the evidence, then there is mis understanding in society.

Lately my office male colleagues despite we have been working for 2 years are not willing to work as friendly as they used to be. I have realized this pattern in all Men. This doesn't just happen to me. It is happening to everyone.

Very less jokes, smile, greetings, hangouts. The people are not interested in office parties anymore.

Men get along together easily. If they can hold beers together, they are friendly. Meanwhile, the women are not interested. There is hierarchy.

I am not talking about creeps(there are some) but it is almost everyone. The colleague in my opposite desk doesn't talk as much as he used to before. He is a normal guy. Makes some jokes towards senior women but his jokes are directed towards their abusive nature rather than her achievement. He makes jokes on himself. He once made a joke that made me angry but when i realized it, i was laughing about it. It was about me when i forgot to wear my ear rings & i was bragging about it.

A guy once wrote in twitter -

If a person (any gender) (guilty/not guilty) is accused by a person(any gender) (victim/fake accusation), whom should we believe ? Evidence or Believe ? metoo or himtoo ? False or Real 

This made me think a lot. I still don't know what is right & wrong. I don't know if these stuff are happening else where. I also think ,i am not thinking other perspectives now. But, Personally i don't believe in this campaign. And also this movement harms more women than men. If i have to believe every woman then i have lost my moral ethics. That is where i draw my line.

So let's just call a spade a spade and admit that ""committing to a female running mate"" means the same thing as refusing to consider any men, solely on the basis of their gender.  Before the Democratic primary was even over, various organizations were already attempting to [bully](https://archive.is/8EFCr) the eventual winner into refusing to consider any men in their choice of running mate.  Within only a few days, Joe Biden appeased this anti-male hate mob by unequivocally [submitting](http://archive.is/b6cPI) to their horrific demand to refuse to consider any men when selecting his running mate.  During the Vice Presidential [debate](https://www.youtube.com/embed/t_G0ia3JOVs?start=1995&end=2040) (from timestamp 33:15 to 34:00 in the video), Kamala Harris smugly rubbed into the faces of everyone watching that she indeed felt that merely being female should seriously be considered one of her qualifications for being selected for higher office.  Then, after the election, she gave a Vice Presidential acceptance speech in which she gushed continuously about women and thanked Joe Biden for choosing her on the basis of her [gender](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iu7AbNaKFqc?start=126&end=150) (from timestamp 2:06 to 2:30 in the video).

Not only is all of this explicitly anti-male, but also, imagine what kind of message feminists would be sending if Biden ends up no longer being able to fulfill the Presidential role and Harris takes over...  Feminists are so obsessed with proving that women can do anything that men can do, but then for some reason they seem to think that the only way a woman can ever stand a chance at becoming President is if someone is given such an obvious leg up in order to help her get there.

While we were out though, he started telling me how life is starting to get him down, he's the only one that works while his partner stays home, they have 2 kids, one is hers from a previous marriage and the other is their child. He mentioned that it's all starting to get to him because he works long hours, including weekends to provide for them but is constantly nagged at and complained to about how he doesn't do enough around the house. He mentioned how he doesn't get to do so much as watch TV most of the time, so he hides away in his home office and recently added a lock to the inside of the door to stop people barging in.

Then he mentioned that they've had to go to couples counselling (her idea, of course) and was telling me how the actual counsellor/therapist is very one sided and won't listen to any of his complaints, apparently the therapist is a gay man, not a woman. But any criticisms he has of his partner gets shot down with ""well what are you doing to make her feel this way?"" 

Is this something that actually happens? Are woman just protected from acknowledging their own flaws even in a place where you're supposed to now?

How can we stand up for men's rights, when companies and media outlets prefer to silence/warp the truth, rather than admit that men can be abused?","So, this 'supposedly' unbiased company, which is utilised to spread awareness of injustice, has now being muted, due to a small percentage of comments being reported by (assumedly) Amber Heard simps; which is a huge disadvantage to those who speak truthfully from experience and not just a 'paid, voiceless bot', as Amber has termed. This vastly popular petition to instill justice in the system now looks as though it is just paid bots and not actual people voicing their opinions on the matter. 

Although I am a female and was never a Johnny Depp 'mega fan', I must say I am a fan of seeing the correct outcome of all DV cases, because regardless of which sex you are, we are humans and regardless, we are all capable of committing abuse. Yes, there are women who are abused and don't fight back, but yes there certainly are men who are abused, who do not fight back as well. 

The slogan was 'Believe All Women', but truth be told, it is incredibly hard for a man to stand up in public and say 'Believe Me Too.' It is honestly laughed upon and disregarded. Well, I say 'Believe All Men', because it takes actual guts for a man, in this day and age to say 'I was abused, yes by a woman and here is all the evidence, here are the tapes, the photos and the witnesses attesting to my statement'. A man of today, is (supposed) to be 'macho, insensitive, dominant and repressed emotionally' and could never be abused (apparently). This is a generalisation, unrelentingly fictional, as each person and specifically, each case is unwaveringly unique. 

With all of the evidence coming to light in their case, I have watched time and time again, certain media outlets pushing agendas. 
I genuinely feel sorry for Johnny Depp, who in this instance, was trying to do the right thing. He tried to run when she was violent, he stood by and was emotionally abused into thinking he was worthless; his only crime; falling for a beautiful woman. A manipulative woman nonetheless. A woman, proven with a history of abuse, caught on tape admitting physical violence, with a string of obvious back-peddling lies alongside mismatched body language actions, entangles her depositions, which suggests obscure truth-twisting in order to suit her 'Believe All Women' claims. That she, 'Amber Heard', was a victim of violence and definitely not 'Johnny Depp'... 

The people are very aware of the truth, thanks to the evidence. It begins with her extortion letter to Johnny Depp, demanding obscene amounts of money and assets which he denied her, thus leading to the allegations, which she coincidently sold to TMZ through doctored 'evidence' to punish him.

The powerful Murdoch-owned media companies and unfortunately now, even '.org websites', are purposefully shunning freedom of speech and truth. 
I am incredibly disheartened that there are still supporters of  Amber Heard in this world, although very few; but evidently they are so caught up in the 'Damsel in Distress movement, that actual logic is displaced and that is what we are fighting against. Corruption, lies and a venomous movement which removes all equal rights for men. Amber Heard is a perpetrator of manipulation, perjury and consistent lies. 

I don't know what else to do but read court statements, news from reliable sources and watch Johnny Depp communities closely, in order to be aware of this painful mishandling of justice. 

With the main court case for Johnny Depp next year, I am hoping that the verdict is in his favour, without the obvious corruption of Justice Nichols to push their agenda. 

I will not discontinue my plight of spreading awareness and continuing this discussion openly, as I believe the only way we can remove a stigma, is to educate ourselves and I personally feel that Johnny Depp winning his case would greatly benefit men's rights and show that men can be victims too.

Reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ocxwrc/why_are_so_many_women_unaware_of_the_emotional/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), however, really set me off to writing this post.

""[Emotional labor](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/emotional-labor-in-the-workplace/202004/emotional-labor-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not) is the regulation of one’s feelings at one’s job."" Although, as acknowledged by the article linked, the meaning has been stretched to mean, ""[Women planning things.](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/)""

Both cases of ""emotional labour"" (and all other cases that include its stretched definition) have one thing in common: an abusive woman.

Picture this: You're a husband who works a job, and are trying to help around the house. Good for you, right? Except, before anything else, you'll be [berated](https://www.katykatikate.com/the-blog/2019/5/7/so-you-want-to-help-around-the-house) for not being a perfect mind-reading magician and doing so earlier. 

Then comes the fun part: Nothing you do will satisfy her. You'll be scolded and called ""incompetent"" for getting the tiniest of details wrong. You're not good enough, and you never will be. Not unless you read her mind perfectly, because she can't bother explaining things to you; she shouldn't have to.

Any confidence you had in yourself is gone, and you stop doing those things you wanted to; you always get them wrong, anyways. This is the real kicker: Now you'll be blamed for not doing enough. You're now a lazy bum, a manchild, a mama's boy. You depend on her for everything, and she can't take it, so she takes it out on you. ""I don't have to ask you to help! You should know already!"". That's the part that gets you. ""You should know already."" You should already know what she needs help doing. You should already be doing the thing. You should already know exactly how to do the thing, to the last detail. You should already know all that, and the only reason you don't is because you're not good enough.

But oh no, you're not the victim in all this; she is, because she's doing the ""emotional labour"". Stop thinking your feelings are valid; they're just a manifestation of your ""fragile male ego"" that ""needs constant appeasing"". She doesn't need to caress your ego.

643,ypno39,2022-11-08,MensRights,"What happens when a woman is being treated the same way an average man and boy are treated daily, with institutionalized hate and a demonizing attitude.","This case (link to the video below) is extremely revealing and important because it shows by creating a real-life comparison, how normalized the dehumanization of men and the infringement of their human dignity have become.

This nice woman who took classes to become a therapist, is describing everything that a typical male college student and many schoolboys, as well as men in workplaces, would be forced to listen  to and agree with as a matter of routine, with one small difference - the word ""men"" was replaced with the word ""white"" causing the statements to apply to her. Her response and the response of the public is what should make us pause: she immediately started a debate, she filed a lawsuit against the college, she started a go-fund-me project to pay for the legal actions, she received support from the public this way, she was interviewed, and her case was covered by the media extensively it seems.

Now pause to consider what statements and messages made in class, have caused all this. Observe that **these are the very same sentences, possibly word-for-word, made in colleges, schools and many work environments about men,** with one word switched - ""men"" with ""white"" - making them about this woman as well which hurt her (those same statements might have been made about men in other classes of that same college).

Almost no man and boy reacts in university, school or work when hearing - and being required to agree with - the same hate speech with the very same phrases where ""men"" and ""boys"" are the target. This woman's actions and the public response create a contrast, to the male silence, that shouts out loud how deeply normalized is the dehumanization of men and how systematic the infringement of their human dignity has become. **They were so deeply dehumanized and from such an early stage that they are not regarding stripping their human dignity from them as something being taken away.** Most of them are so accustomed to being expected to sit and listen to hate speech against them and to repeat it that they don't even think of starting a debate and taking to court and then telling the public about this, as this woman did.

**It takes being a woman to feel human enough to deserve an apology and compensation when hearing and receiving the same dehumanization men undergo daily,** because in the west, at least in very wide social environments, women are the only ones society grants human dignity and even the only ones society assigns humanity to, which is why a woman was so surprised by this heart-of-darkness reality that she took legal actions while millions of men and boys living under this institutionalized cruelty remain quiet. Men heard it in this class, but did not feel entitled for an apology and compensation - their human dignity was stripped from them long before that, and their new sub-human status has been normalized, they have been broken to make them accept that, and this woman's response - the response of an intact human being - shows by comparison, to what a degree.

Men. Boys. Wake up. You are human. Never remain silent. Always speak up. At all cost - speak up. Like that woman has. You are as human as she is. You have the same rights and the same innate human dignity. You should have the same expectations of society as she has. You should expect this from society - to see you as a human being, against whom it is forbidden to direct institutionalized hate and demonizing preaching.

I was at the oceanfront today, relaxing. Enjoying the weather. Doing some browsing, not really buying anything. Decided to go into a pizza place to grab a slice. I hold the door for a woman, who stops and gives me a death glare.

Woman: ""*You think I NEED you to hold the door for me?!*""
Me: ""*No ma'am, I was just raised to be polite."" I smile.
Woman: ""*That's what's wrong with the world today,* **MEN** *feel as if women need to have things DONE FOR THEM!*""
Me: ""*No ma'am, I was just holding the door. I know you can do it just as well as I can, if not better. I've never had a woman hold the door for me, though!*""

My attempt at levity blew right past her, and at this point I knew she was looking for a reason to run me into the ground. I shrug her off and start to head into the pizza place, a locally owned restaurant. I'm headed off by the female manager who is coming to see what the fuss is about. We step back outside, and at this point a police officer that was on the corner and heard her raised voice came had made it over to see what was going on. The woman claimed I was sexually harassing her, and almost didn't clarify that she felt I was harassing her based on her sex, not harassing her sexually. She did it by accident, and I could see her look of 'oh crap, I thought I was going to nail this guy"". In most instances in my state (and probably all of the US), people err on the side of a woman in a social or domestic dispute. I could see the officer sizing me up to see if I would be troublesome WHEN he had to haul me in, not IF he needed to, WHEN. It clicked for him when she slipped up, and I am ***lucky*** she did. 

I told the officer I would have held the door for just about anyone. Maybe not a single guy or a group of guys, but if a guy had his kids with him or it was a family or someone I wanted to show respect to, like a policeman, fireman, soldier, etc etc. That respect was instilled in me since I was young, and I believe in that little act as a show of respect. This woman acted as if I was demeaning her. I know you can open a damn door. I know you're not incapable. I'm not demeaning you, if anything I'm saving you the trouble of doing it yourself. Don't like it? Grab the door and tell me ""*No thanks, you go ahead.*"" and I will let it go at that. 

So, to de-escalate the situation the officer tells us to go our separate ways and let that be that. The female manager speaks up to refuse me service, even though the other woman is clearly in the wrong. She smiles smugly, and in an exaggerated gesture she opens the door and walks into the pizza shop, leaving me with the manager and the officer. I looked at the manager and asked her why I was refused service when the woman was causing the scene. 

Manager: ""*Well, I have a business to run and it's all about appearances. I can't have people thinking we are woman haters.*""
Me: ""*Ma'am, I get it. Really, I understand. I'm not going to say it's not fair, because I know life's not fair. I just want you to think of this. I'm not going to look well on this, and I'm going to tell my story to others who will sympathize with me. It's possible they'll re-tell the story, and so on and so forth. Word of mouth will spread, and though the story may be lost, the word of your business' biased practices will spread. Now, you've been out here talking to me for five minutes, and this hateful woman has been left to her own devices in your store full of male employees.*"" at this point she glances inside, worried. ""*Even if she doesn't find a reason to be offended, the* ***best case scenario*** *is she frequents your business, and you have a really crappy customer. OR, she invites her friends here, who are likely close-minded to her, and you have SEVERAL MORE crappy customers with bad attitudes. Worst-case scenario, she does find a reason to complain and gets a free meal. That means you've lost the sale of TWO patrons, including me. AND, she talks shit about your restaurant and employees and have TWO people driving customers away. All because of what we have between our legs? How is that right? And do you REALLY feel like you've done the owner of the business a favor no matter how things turn out from here?*""

Manager: ""*Well, what would you have done in my place?*""
Me: ""*The right thing. But that's too much to ask these days.*""

Immediately after I finished saying my peace, I turned and walked off. Other than here, I have no spread ill words about this restaurant, because the owner may not know this is how his/her/their manager(s) deal with these situations, and if business was severely impacted, there are those who had nothing to do with this whose jobs will be effected.

**TLDR; Woman rapes a 15-year-old boy repeatedly and gets incredibly light sentence.**

The problem here is that Pennsylvania law does in fact cover female offenders, any sexual intercourse that's involuntary is sexual assault (some states make it so only the ""penetrator"" can be a rapist). So what she did is highly illegal, she did it many times over the course of 9 months, yet she's only getting a year in **COUNTY JAIL. NOT PRISON.** For those of you who don't know, county jail isn't going to have many felons, those usually go to a state prison. So she will keep company with people who have committed minor offenses such as drug possession, rather than people who committed her type of crime. The worst part is that she was let off because of her ""genuine remorse."" I wonder how they empirically measured that?

So speaking of activism, does anybody reading this live in Pennsylvania? The judge, Alan Medge, should lose his next election, which is unfortunately quite far-off in 2023. Pennsylvania sadly does not allow recall elections, which is a topic for another day.

646,97w0zk,2018-08-16,MensRights,Being gossiped about and undermined by women in the workplace because you make them look as underperformers,"Ok, here we go: I’m a guy who’s as a team leader and **project manager** (some projects), my team was formed by two women and me last year, and both of them became, eventually, friends.

Becoming friends made it difficult when I had to reprimend one or tell them to do their tasks and stop “helping each other” if the “helping” was just enabling bad behavior. Eg, woman A wouldn’t study something because the other one was better at it, even though woman A needed to know it anyway.

Eventually one of them got transferred after she tried to undermine me and get me to lose my position. The other one remained, and I got a new guy as a replacement.

I recently found out, however, that the woman who works with me regularily chats with the other one about me and my “negative sides”.

The one who got transferred, in turn, spills all of this to other people in the company, and it already got to my manager.

For example, during one of this chit chat events, my manager’s secretary (another close friend of the ex-team member, and an ex PM who couldn’t do her job and got demoted) is now suggesting that they tell my coworker to talk to my manager about me because “I’m not in charge and I need to stop treating my team members like interns”

All of this is worrying me because the whole thing is aimed at undermining me, and it’s done by people who aren’t even working with me.

How on earth can I protect myself against this and go to work with complete ease? I can take my team members complaining about me because, well, I’m the boss so that’s to be expected, but I cannot tolerate that every single complian is a tragedy blown out of proportion because it’ll end up costing me my position.

And the woman who’s enabling this is using it to cover her own ass. If I end up as the dictator asshole who wants to boss other people around, her own deficiencies, that actually require being bossed around, can be forgiven...

So, she strikes from afar, saying “see? Not even her current saint of a coworker can tolerate him...”, spin, casually, in the direction of my manager...

——————————

All of this is being framed as me not being able to do my job, and the people doing this have been isolated for their inability to do their jobs (except they were not told specifically that to avoid hurting them):

- First it was about “how I was a good techie but bad at managing people because I had to cut slack to those who *did things differently* (ie, didn’t want to work)”.

- Now it became “he’s too micromanaging and can’t do this with seniors”, or otherwise

- “it’s not his job to check on other people’s work because he isn’t the boss (ie, manager/owner), he asks for X, let the coworker do X and shut up about the rest”.


And I swear to god, if i lose my position because of this, I’m gonna raise so much hell with the owners that these two will either get fired or seriously reprimended... but I don’t want that.

BUT. Can we say ""virtually every woman, no exception"" was in this situation? How come? If you listen to some feminist, every woman is raped on a regular basis. 

I have understood more when my niece, who is a diehard woke++ feminist told me: ""uncle, ALL men are abusers. Haven't you ever put your eyes on street on a woman's breasts? Than you objectified her. Than you are an abuser.""

Okeydokey, than I am an abuser.

What about men? How many times I've heard girls screaming ""omg omg I love his ass"". What about sorority parties? A man who goes to a strip club is dirty, women going to see chippendales are... what? Free women?

Not to talk about domestic abuse of men, who is a taboo and was already discussed here. I come from a family where my regreted father has been beaten in front of my eyes by my mother during years in all ways: with the fist, with the foot, slapped, thrown on the ground, punished, insulted. No one will believe, no one will care, because he was a solid guy, and she was a frail woman, but he would never raise the hand against her. I had told it to a female acquintance and she had replied: ""this is because he was weak"".",Infinite_Procedure98,t2_79xu1ry9,0.92,88,76
648,2mflo8,2014-11-16,MensRights,My view on shirtstorm as a business owner,"Hi MensRights,

This is a throw away because speaking your mind can sometimes border on illegal.

Let me start by saying in my personal life I believe the following:

Women should have full control medical control over their bodies without exception.

There is no justification for sexual harassment at all, even if she's naked. You have no right to touch her without permission.

Woman are just as professionally capable as men in every situation from construction to technology to child care and everywhere in between and not.

Basically, I believe women are equal to men. I treat all women with the same respect as men, and hold them to the same standards as I hold men.


With that out of the way lets talk about media blowouts like #shirtstorm and the like.

If I were filling a position in my company, and I were given two identical resumes. During the interview they both answer all my questions the exact same way. One is female, the other is male. I would 100% of the time pick the male candidate. Why would I do such a horrible thing? Safety. Hell, even if the female is slightly more qualified I'd pick the male. 

When I hire a female, there is a much higher chance I'm getting somebody who buys into the social justice brainwashing that is the media today. When I see women walking through the downtown of the city naked or shirtless to protest victim blaming I cheer them on. But when they turn around and tell men what to wear because they find a shirt with some cleavage on it offensive I become horrified. The line between empowerment and objectification is moved for the convenience of women and used as a weapon against men.

Let me give a specific example that happened somewhere I used to work. The company did a lot of searching via different search engines, and looking at less then reputable sites looking for specific things. Once in a while a pop-up add with naked women came up. We did not use filtering because everything that came up was relevant to the research we were doing, including viruses. One day we hire a female analyst. Her job was to collate reports. She through a HUGE fit in her first week when she saw a porn ad had popped up on one of the men's monitors. She was informed that sometimes this is the case in our line of business. She wrote it off as 'mansplaining' and eventually threaten legal action. IT installed blockers, and our reports and analysis and product suffered for it. A year later that business closed it's doors because its reports deviated too much from its competitors.

I do run a technology business. But it does not do what that company did. We do not commonly get porn pop-ups etc. But the fear remains that something would trigger an episode like this in my workplace and cause the death of what I use to put food on the table for my family.

This is completely unfair to women that I end up making business decisions based on this. But running a small business is a risk. Every choice you make is a risk. When you have two options, you will ALWAYS take the choice you believe is more likely to see success. I don't want to have to make decisions like this. I want to be free to choose the best candidate for the position. These oppression politics are not only an attack on men's rights, they are a detriment to professional women.

I would love to hear from other small business owners on this subject.",throwaway982341,t2_jdokx,0.6,8,24

651,t8ot5r,2022-03-07,MensRights,Women who hug,"I met a woman the other day (it does happen). Someone I didn't know; someone I'm likely to be working with a lot in the next few weeks. I should preface my remarks with the fact that I hold this woman in very high regard; she's very skilled at her job and I was the decision-maker in hiring her. She's delightful company professionally; I barely know her personally. She's also conventionally very attractive and a good fifteen years my junior.

The first thing she did, on our first meeting after the interview, was approach me for a hug. I instinctively recoiled, and a look of some confusion and offence crossed her face. It was awkward. I hated doing it. But ""I don't do hugs,"" I explained. ""Not in this me-too world.""

She literally gaped at me in absolute astonishment.

Naturally, since this particular woman is, as far as I know, a completely reasonable and sane individual, her reaction was to start explaining that I was overreacting and she has *no* intention of taking any action against me, and it's probably true. The harder-line feminists of the world would probably lecture me on the idea that if I don't give her any reason to object then I won't suffer the consequences, but as I say, I don't know this woman personally. I don't know how easy she is to irritate. I don't know how angry she gets, how quickly, and [it is a material fact that women are more likely to exhibit negative emotion than men](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/sexual-personalities/201504/are-women-more-emotional-men).

But even if we assume they're right and it's rare - and it probably is - the problem with is, as we're all painfully aware, it's a huge risk to take. In many modern western countries, any woman has the arbitrary power to have any man arrested, publicly pilloried as a sex pest and permanently deny him a social life and a career, that is, to completely destroy his life, even if the case never goes to trial ([and sometimes they do](https://www.itv.com/news/london/2016-02-16/commuter-cleared-of-ludicrous-sex-assault-warns-the-same-could-happen-to-any-man); that example is rare only in that the guy was exonerated and received a lot of publicity; the woman, who was obviously lying, was not prosecuted).

Honestly, refusing this woman a hug was probably pointless in any case. If she even *claimed* I'd touched her in a way she didn't like, I'd be instantly arrested, even if I actually hadn't; I feel like I'm giving myself the best possible chance, but I have no real confidence in that.

Still, this is where we now are. This is the world in which we have to exist. This is what a minority of feminist activists wanted, and they got it. So, woman-I-just-hired, I apologise for what happened on Saturday, but it's because of the fact that every woman I meet is effectively a ticking time bomb capable of destroying my life for any reason, or none at all.",Huffers1010,t2_a0xsse2g,0.89,538,197

A woman who made a series of false rape claims has been jailed following work by some of our specialist detectives.

Cathy Richardson made a series of allegations against two men between January and May last year.

These allegations led to officers carrying out 60 investigations.

As part of these investigations, one of the men she accused was arrested and made subject to a forensic examination.

However, as officers progressed their enquiries into Richardson’s claims, they found that CCTV, phone data, and information from automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras showed the alleged attacker was not in the area at the time Richardson alleged the assaults to have taken place.

One of the men even agreed to have a GPS tracking tag fitted to his ankle which would send an alarm to police if it was destroyed or taken off.

On a number of occasions, data from the tag was analysed and showed he was not in the area when Richardson said the attack had taken place.

Richardson, 35, of North Road, Westcliff, was arrested on 28 May last year and later charged with perverting the course of justice.

She admitted 10 counts at Salisbury Crown Court on 23 May this year.

At the same court today (Friday 30 September), she was sentenced to five years and one month in prison.",beleidigtewurst,t2_nislevkd,0.98,608,68
655,hlzfhy,2020-07-06,MensRights,Any other gay dudes out there that are fed up with feminism and the way women are permitted to emotionally and psychologically abuse men in our society?,"I suppose most of you wouldn’t think that a gay guy could understand exactly how heterosexual men are victimized by women. But then again, you’ve not met our mothers. This being said I grew up with an emotionally vacant father and a mother with borderline personality disorder. My mother was a woman who emotionally and psychologically tormented me, while my father at best ignored it and at worst enabled it. She was always (and still is) one way in public, and another way in private. If ever I have called her out on her behavior, it’s because I’m whining, and not because she’s emotionally disturbed. She seems to believe that because she birthed me and kept me physically extant, that I am therefore obliged to pacify her paranoid ideations, and to validate her many delusions. 

Now that I’m grown and have entered the workforce, I’ve noticed that women are allowed to get away with this type of behavior in all areas of our society. Even though my mother, having borderline personality disorder, is an extreme example of this, I notice females in general behaving in ways that cross soooo many boundaries. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to put up with toxic female behavior in my life, and I will never even be in a relationship with a woman. Recently I had to leave a job, one that I was very successful at, because my manager, who was only made manager because she has a vagina, felt threatened by my success. I brought tens of thousands of dollars worth of business to that company, and the hardcore feminist general manager made a woman who had brought the store zero dollars our store manager. This is only one in a litany of negative experiences I’ve had with females.

To all the straight guys out there I want to say this: at this point in history you have allies in your gay bros. I’ve been talking to many of my gay friends, and we all agree, woman have gone too far in their behavior, and the society that has enabled them must change. You know there is a problem when woman have become too bitchy for even gay men to tolerate. 

During the midst of this crisis I’ve noticed toxic women, referred to now as “Karen’s,” become more aggressive in their behavior. What is the breaking point I wonder? Based on my conversations with other men, heterosexual and homosexual alike, this point seems to be fast approaching. Men cannot allow women to emotionally and psychologically terrorize us anymore. The judicial system which has permitted this state of affairs must be reformed, for the sake of our sons and grandsons.",jojopotato1989,t2_62zvms0o,0.97,336,29

658,s1c7f,2012-04-09,MensRights,"My story as a woman working at hazardous, sometimes deadly, physically exhausting, male-dominated job, that involves plenty of heavy lifting.","Hi MensRights, I saw a post here where a fellow was complaining that the women he works with never have to pick up heavy things like he does, so should be paid less.  I had to laugh.

I'm a bicycle courier, who works in a metropolitan area, population 800,000.  I started delivering in 2008 once the recession hit and I found out that my new BFA was not terribly marketable.  I was offered a job with a small delivery company and took it, because I love the outdoors and love to bicycle.  I was the only female.  In 2009 I interviewed with my current company.  They were hiring a full staff for a new branch that was about to open.  They would pay me more than my last gig. I would be the only female courier in the company, again.  

Now, I'm not large, even for a woman, at 5'4 and 138lbs. I sometimes have to bike with deliveries that are a quarter or a third of my body weight.  Some of my fellow delivery guys are like human gorillas who could take a giant delivery and twirl it on their little finger as they biked. Those guys had an obvious advantage. Still, every time I was assigned a giant box, I jumped at the chance because I would make more money taking bigger deliveries, that's how it works.  And I wanted to prove myself.  I had a few close calls while over extending myself in this way, so I decided that trying to carry a giant box on my handlebars or on my back wasn't going to work.  Instead, upgraded my bike for greater cargo capacity.  [Here's my large cargo set up.](http://www.gratefulrachel.com/portfolio/fugiwithtrailer.jpg) I figured that rather than break my back on these heavy deliveries, I would let my machine do the work.

For the next year I really loved my job, despite being hit by a car once, and enduring the all close calls and other job-related boo boos, of your typical bike courier.  My boss loved me because I was an exemplary worker.  He put me in charge of training every new delivery person.  I had the most seniority at my store, so I got my pick of the deliveries, and made the most money.  Our business was growing so he hired more couriers and we got along great.

In 2010, my boss was transferred to a bigger city.  The new boss was a nightmare.  He was real butt-hurt dweller type and clearly hated women.  He was angry and abusive and liked to fight with his workers.  He got annoyed with me because I refused to indulge him in ways I found unprofessional.  I stayed reliable as a worker despite that.  One day he called me a whore, totally out of the blue.  Everyone around us fell silent.  I told him that if he ever used abusive or sexual language with me again I would report it to his boss.  

A a couple weeks later, he stopped scheduling me and told me that I didn't fit in with his vision for the business.  I was ""not dynamic enough"", and other mumbo jumbo, and that he had replaced me.  It was a sneaky way of firing me, since it meant he didn't have go though the HR protocol of writing me up and firing me on paper.

When an older branch found out that I was available, they hired me immediately.  It was great because I kept my job, but it also was terrible to loose my seniority and take a pay cut.  

So I've been at this job, no major issues ever since.  In my time, a couple other women have been hired as couriers, and woman who used to do lower paying jobs for the company are being promoted to delivery.  Don't get all [DEY TOOK ER GERBS!](http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxyujdMM8P1r8eg8lo1_500.gif) about it, lol.

aggravated robbery, passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a grocery store in Minneapolis,

under the influence of fentanyl and methamphetamine , violent home invasion,

entering a woman’s home, pointing a gun at her stomach

and searching the home for drugs and money, possession of cocaine,

criminal trespassing and a stint for a theft was accidentally strangled to

death when he was resisting arrest.

His death caused a local black lives matter protest that de evolved into

a riot that caused millions of dollars of damage.

However during this riot something very odd happened.

During the riot a black man in a ski mask ran towards her

parents house and tossed a brick through the window.

Being a white guy dating an asian woman visiting her asian parents

we all had no idea why this guy tossed a brick through a window.

I go outside and I see a 6 foot tall 250 pound black man being pinned

down by a 4 foot 9 inch 150 pound asian woman.

This entitled man says "" I was wronged and I am entitled to retroduction. ""

I run over and my wife to see her pummeling this man.

He was punching him in the kidneys repeatedly.

She yelled "" We are not police officers. We had nothing to do with Floyds death.""

When I reach her my wife Ann she says "" Call the police.""

I pull out my cell phone and call 911.

The phone says "" Were sorry all circuits are busy.""

So I call the non emergency number and tell them I had a noise complaint.

The police arrived in seven minutes and after seeing the busted window.

They arrested the man.

There was a popular fast food place that served sub sandwiches.

Not the standard Subway sandwich shop.

This place had two first names in it. 

Jimmy Kimmel and  John Candy are quite funny guys.

This Sandwich shop had reopened upon the condition

that all consumers wear mask.

However a large amount of consumers refused to wear a mask.

When an employee asked "" Sir could you please wear a mask? ""

Only to have the consumer tell the employee to fuck off.

So they required a security guard at the location to inforce policy.

I was required to stand near the front door and when someone entered

I would point at a sign.

Then I said "" Would you please wear a mask? ""

Of course most consumers would comply.

But it turns out that an entitled mother isn't so willing to comply.

She marched up to the door like she was a member of a certain german army.

She was about to walk past me when I put my arm in her way.

I said "" Excuse me. You can't enter this business without wearing a mask.""

This woman tried to push her way past me but I grabbed her arm.

She said "" Let me go! I am a paying consumer. You have to let me in.""

I said "" Actually you haven't purchased anything yet so you are not a consumer.

You will not be a consumer unless you wear a mask.""

This woman huffed and walked away.

An hour later someone with a news camera showed up.

The camera had a fox 17 sticker on it.

The News guy asked "" Did you refuse to allow this elderly woman into this public accessible eatery?

I look at the news guy and said "" Due to Covid 19 this corporation owned location requires

 minimum personal protection and restricts all meals to take out only. This 35 year old woman 

refused to wear a mask. So according to company policy I asked her to leave.""

The news reporter guy instantly turned to the woman and shot her a dirt look.

He then left the location and the woman followed behind him yelling

 "" This isn't right. They need to serve me!""

The reporter drives away with an angry look.

I look at the woman and watch as she climbs into her car and leaves.

688,gtq5vh,2020-05-31,NuxTakuSubmissions,Who the fuck is George Floyd?,"A very short....extremely edited video came out.

The video shows a man being arrested.

During the arrest the man suffers an asthmatic episode.

None of the officers offer assistance. 

Suddenly tons of black lives matter posters come out of the closet.

Well new information has come out that was ignored by protesters.

First of all the black SUV George was smoking crack in it was stolen.

Yeah according to officers not involved in the arrest who were across the street

at the time the officers found  Schedule **II**/IIN Controlled Substances in the SUV.

Furthermore average people who were traveling to work witnessed the woman passenger who

posted the video yell profanities at the police in an effort to provoke them.

Friends of George also state that the woman who remains unknown cut out NINE MINUTES of video footage before posting it.

WHAT DID SHE REMOVE? Well a clue to the events is revealed with a newly posted video.

Her name is SuzyLu. She has been abusing the flag system on youtube and has been intentionally targeting anyone who's been criticizing her. She's also used Copyright systems against other creators.

Nowhere near enough people are reporting this woman. In the long run she is a major risk to the type of content we the servants of Lord Nuxanor enjoy. I have several links to one of the youtubers doing reports. If requested i'll put them in a future post. 

Lord Nuxanor's content is the very definition of fair use. This woman abuses fair use to such a degree it blows the mind. Where she is literally Re-Uploading full episodes and doing next to NOTHING: She's getting away with it. 

It has gotten to the point where youtubers involved in this are beginning to get corporate copyright involved by contacting the companies CREATING THE ANIME. The actual copyright holders. This could turn into a holy war, and if they went whole hog, it could result in the deletion of all this type of content. The Corporate Copyright holders do not play around. Remember the adpocolypses. If this is not stopped now. This could end up being worse.

Look up SuzyLu and you'll find what you need to know. If you want links to summaries of the stunt's shes pulling i'll post them in the responses. This community has been absolutely kickass and your help is needed. Thanks for reading.

I own a popular TikTok account where I post furry art, and I have been repeatedly told to kill myself by trolls on the app. Recently, I’ve even faced harassment in real life. This last weekend, I was at the park with some friends roleplaying. I was wearing my German Shepard dog fur suit and roleplaying as a puppy, playing fetch with my friends and chasing the other dogs. Soon, a woman came to our group and began verbally harassing us. I was extremely scared, so I apologized to her. She returned to her bench but continued to watch us from afar. After she saw me lift my leg and urinate in a bush, she called the police. An officer responded to the call and I was issued an ordinance violation. I’m still extremely shaken from the experience and I feel like I was targeted for being a furry. I just don’t understand why furries are treated so much worse than members of other fandoms.",Lolitain,t2_8fs4syy7,1.0,2,3

751,hapg65,2020-06-17,NuxTakuSubmissions,My Girlfriend,"Some one asked via a Reddit message "" Your girlfriend is Asian. What type of Asian and did you date her just because she was Asian? "" well here is my response. Sorry it is a long one. Things are complex for me.

Let me lay out who my GF is....In my city there is a very popular Japanese chinese fusion place run by two families. This place had the female members on wait staff and male staff cooking. Yes in Japan it is normal for women to attend to the guest while the men cook. Cooking is seen as a skill that requires steady hands and discipline. Plus a iron will to withstand the heat . So yeah cooking is a man's work. I remember this because I use to eat their a lot because I loved the portions.

Anyway given that A is a short small person who reminds people of a doll she was put on the front of the of house. Greeting people and giving out menus and water oe bread I guess. Not really sure what her role was beyond being a mascot.

I had a zero contact childhood and to compensate I watched animated love stories. Okay I Watched anime and loved everything Asian. If Kim Joon from North Korea had offered me a job murdering people by gun shot to the head. But was offering me a Korean bride as a sign on bonus I wouldn't hesitate to sign on. I was basically obsessed with anything Asian. So when I meet A for the first time I was speech less and experienced for the first time the darkness of my soul.  You see the moment I saw her I knew she was perfect for me. The family had a strict dress code of primary colors while at work and she was wearing all black. When I saw she was a rebel I felt a connection to her cause and knew that family members just don't understand you sometimes. However when i saw she was asian my obsession with anime got into high gear and when she said "" Welcome to .."" and then grabbed my arm to guide me to the booth she triggers an instant lust reaction. i had a ow dear god moment that had me gasping for air. My friends who were laughing slightly when I froze up in the door way. saw my expression go from shock to labored breathing and pure obsession. I was actually entertaining the idea of abducting her.

A voice in my head actually broke down into a step by step instruction on how I could get this Asian woman out of the eattery and into my house. The break down included her being in a dog collar chained to the wall. But my friends who saw this as an enjoyable night out realized I was freaking out. My rasping breath is a massive indication I am about to do something people would consider a crime. My friends take me to a booth and get me some water and after I calm down my friend Lance says "" This is getting real guys. Did you see his reaction to her? "" Lisa says "" Yeah I saw freaking out and I know that isn't good. "" She knows from first hand experience about that after she appeared in front of me wearing just a towel and touched my arm. This was done for laughs in front of my other friends. They found my reactions interesting. But the moment she touched my arm and asked "" Are you uneasy? "" I reacted by simply yanking her towel off in front of everyone and kissing right on the mouth as she stood  there in shock. So Lisa knows that me freaking out isn't good. After a moment I recover and we order some food. As were are eating Lance drops his plastic fork onto his plate and says "" I got a brilliant idea. Lets get wolf here and that mascot together. "" Lisa say "" No fucking way. He can't handle that and you know it will end badly. Now I had returned to my normal emotions are masked state. Normally my emotions are consealed. But any contact triggers a lust response and my instant lust response that is a gate way to other emotions. So being indifferent I said "" do what you want. "" 

Lance got his entire social media network working on this.

Unlike other people Lance is selective about who he allows into his social media and has formed a group of locals who he can have lunch with or dinner with just like now. Lance also has an odd thing he does. Do you know when you buy a kid a gift and feel happy when the kid is over joyed. Lance had this same reaction but to the extreme. We joked that lance had an orgasm when helping people. We once joked that if a woman was unable to have a child because her husband was having sperm troubles. Lance would impregnate her on the first try without any pleasure during or after. But the moment she announced she was pregnant and how everyone was happy about it. Lance would be overcome with orgasmic light and fade into nothing until he was needed again.

After we finish our meal and headed to Lisa's to watch TV. Lance went home and got started collecting information and giving people task. Lance would have people go into the eatery and while in ear shot say "" Wolf was so nice today. "" Yes my friend call me wolf. A is working and keeps hearing about this man wolf and about how awesome he is. After two months of this on a daily basis Lance has us return to the eatery for dinner..Lance starts joking about my previous visit and we start talking while waiting for our stir fry Eventually A realized they were calling me wolf and remember all the gossip. She comes over and starts to ask questions. Lance interrupted by saying "" If you want to know more about wolf why not be his girlfriend? "". There was a silence and I saw lance waiting for her response.  She gave me a once over and said "" I don't get involved with consumers. "" Before she could finish Lance says "" Lets go! "" We follow Lances lead leave and as we are on the side walk A says "" Your food? "" Lance looks her dead in face and says "" Put it in a container to go and give it o wolf. I asked you an honest question and you quote company policy at me. I thought this was a friendly family place so we could have an honest conversation. I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN. We will never be your consumers ever again. Following his logic I agree and make an angry face. We wait outside and A bring us our food. I hand A 30 dollars and turn to leave. Lance says "" I expect an apology for wolf written and mailed before we will return. "" Lance hands her his old school business card and we leave. 

I was disappointed that lance failed at his task. Lance gets depressed when he fails at helping people. Lance shares the results with his social media group. people in his group know of me but they are angry that lance is upset. They act out and spread the word.  people who normally don't give a fuck about anyone suddenly hear lance is upset that his helping didn't work. These people were pissed off. The most vocal was Lances mother. Her reaction was pure entitled. She hears that a young lady who is forced to work all day in a eatery was offered a relaxed evening of snacks and movies as a way to assist her in a hectic time in her life. But that this ungrateful girl refused by quoting from a food chain policy rule book. Lances mother had a local freeze out business dropped. A of course was also tending to the eatery facebook page. Tons of messages poor in about me. They asked why did they refuse Lances request and why they lied to everyone about being family owned.

Losing money by the day and gaining negative attention from Lances mother. A went to Lances house and asked lance to accept her apology and end the freeze out. Lance had me come over when A first arrived after stalling for time for ten minutes by saying how offended he was by her response. The moment I arrive Lance brings her over to me and has me hold her in my arms. The moment is surreal. A looks directly up at me confused. Lance says "" You are wolf's girlfriend. Wolf is your boyfriend You will be a couple and love each other. "" I feel A relaxing to my arms and accepting what Lance said to her. Lances mother is smiling at her sons good deed. Suddenly A says "" But my father says I can't date Consumers. "" Lances mom interjects "" He hasn't eaten there for months he isn't a consumer. "" A agrees with that and nods. Lance and his mother nods as well. Lance ends this moment with a cheesy gesture. He hugs the both of us.

Why do I call my GF by the letter A? Her name is written 愛魅力的な....Which is Attractive lover or something. Most people here her names meaning and say  "" Awwww that's so cute. "" So I started calling her All but she insisted I just call her A instead. But I rarely use that name given I call her by pet names like cutie and good girl plus many others all the time.

Yes we have stayed together. Even with a forceful start we started to get along and I helped her out with a lot of things until we forged an emotion connection due to advice Lance gave her. "" Whenever you speak to wolf make sure you have his attention. You can do so by holding his hand or something.""  Lance knew about my childhood given he was an old friend and knew what she needed to do to forge a real connection.",Wolf-man-420,t2_2q3l1dks,0.6,1,4

I am not a normal person. Due to my childhood I have undergone an extreme behavioral and mental changes. I will explain my status the best I can. My feeling are insulated and verbal insults rarely have a reaction. Now when I mean insulated I mean all of them. Love, Lust and happiness as well as Rage anger and hate are insulated as well. My girl friend understands that my emotions are buried under a mountain of overprotective darkness that has built up over the years. She understands that emotional gestures are completely lost upon me. If you tell me "" I love you "" and present me with a flower or candy it is a lost effort. I will keep the item given it is a gift but the words are completely useless. Now my girlfriend however has learn that simply verbal interactions are basically disregarded. I make note of the words collect the meaning of the words spoken but the emotion of the words spoken are totally lost on me. Now my girlfriend realized that my mixing other interactions with in a normal spoken exchange it can cause new reactions. You see whenever someone makes physical contact my reaction is instantly sexual. You see any touch no matter how small or no matter who did the touching would instantly trigger sexual excitement. Yeah I know it is odd but during my childhood I had no physical interactions with my parents, siblings or grandparents. No hugging, Kissing or even spanking. My mother had a serious problem with any contact of any kind being the victim of unwilling sexual intercourse at age five. A situation I still can't understand. I mean five year olds to 16 year olds have zero sexual appeal. They have no breast and their sexual parts don't even function yet. Fucking a kid is just like trying to vacuum a floor with the appliance unplugged. You can push it across the floor but it isn't going to be able to do the task you want. The only time I had any physical interactions were highly sexual...I mean that...I would jump directly into sex with zero foreplay with countless sexual partners. The nano second I discovered sex I fucked everyone I could in an effort to find a human connection I could call romantic. I automatically associate any skin on skin contact with sexual intercourse. So my girlfriend will touch my shoulder and after triggering my lust emotions she will whisper things to me which will trigger additional emotions. Which is something that rarely happens. However while in this state it is also very easy to trigger my anger.

I was at the movies with my GF and we are in line getting pop corn. Now you see as a couple we stand out. My GF is a four foot five inch skinny Asian lady who dresses in all black. She has on a old style dress. The dress was knee long and had no shoulders or arm sleeves. I was wearing all black. I was wearing jeans and a t shirt. In a room full of people wearing normal clothes. Blue jeans, cargo pants, white t shirts and ADIDAS logo shirts. . My girlfriend was leaning against me and was speaking to me "" I am so happy we could spend time together. "" Given her contact I instantly felt my lust start gushing from me as I felt my erection getting hard. My girlfriend then spoke kindly my more enjoyable light hearted emotions are triggered. I am feeling happy for the fourth time in my life. As the line sits still because of a large family my happy moment is destroyed.

You see a mother with four teenage guys stepped up behind us. We are standing there waiting for the older couple. The large family was getting in line for the movie. The older couple was concerned by the salt content of the popcorn. My girl friend was looking over the candy counter when suddenly a hand swings into my line of sight and slaps my GF's ass. I get territorial. My GF is basically considered my own property. My friends know that they are not allowed to touch stuff. So when my friends walked into the lobby of the theatre and witnessed this they exclaim "" Nooooo. "" My GF turned around and said "" Which one of you touched my ass? "" I instantly turned around and said"" which one of you did that?! "" None of the teens say a word. As I approached the counter to get popcorn I am looking forward and ask for two large popcorns. Then turning to my GF to ask what she wanted I see the same arm coming towards my GF so I grab his arm. The moment I grab the teens arm his mother starts yelling at me about assaulting her kid. I yell over her "" Your Son sexually assaulted my girlfriend. If he does it again I will truly assault your kid. "" I grab our popcorn and soda walk off. The kid shoots me a dirty look so I openly flipped the teen off and went into the movie. After a few minutes I hear the mother say "" Why can't my kids watch this movie? "" The ticket person says "" This movie is rated R and your tickets are for another movie."" But they close the door to the theatre and me, my GF and friends watch the movie. However as we exit the movie I hear "" You sold me tickets for a movie so I wanna see the movie. "" The lady saw us exit and gave me a angry look. I just flip her off and leave. As I am leaving I hear "" I never encountered such lazy employees you should ban him. "" I didn't get banned and that dumb lady missed her movie.

Some one asked via a Reddit message "" Your girlfriend is Asian. What type of Asian and did you date her just because she was Asian? "" well here is my response. Sorry it is a long one. Things are complex for me.

Let me lay out who my GF is....In my city there is a very popular Japanese chinese fusion place run by two families. This place had the female members on wait staff and male staff cooking. Yes in Japan it is normal for women to attend to the guest while the men cook. Cooking is seen as a skill that requires steady hands and discipline. Plus a iron will to withstand the heat . So yeah cooking is a man's work. I remember this because I use to eat their a lot because I loved the portions.

Anyway given that A is a short small person who reminds people of a doll she was put on the front of the of house. Greeting people and giving out menus and water oe bread I guess. Not really sure what her role was beyond being a mascot.

I had a zero contact childhood and to compensate I watched animated love stories. Okay I Watched anime and loved everything Asian. If Kim Joon from North Korea had offered me a job murdering people by gun shot to the head. But was offering me a Korean bride as a sign on bonus I wouldn't hesitate to sign on. I was basically obsessed with anything Asian. So when I meet A for the first time I was speech less and experienced for the first time the darkness of my soul. You see the moment I saw her I knew she was perfect for me. The family had a strict dress code of primary colors while at work and she was wearing all black. When I saw she was a rebel I felt a connection to her cause and knew that family members just don't understand you sometimes. However when i saw she was asian my obsession with anime got into high gear and when she said "" Welcome to .."" and then grabbed my arm to guide me to the booth she triggers an instant lust reaction. i had a ow dear god moment that had me gasping for air. My friends who were laughing slightly when I froze up in the door way. saw my expression go from shock to labored breathing and pure obsession. I was actually entertaining the idea of abducting her.

A voice in my head actually broke down into a step by step instruction on how I could get this Asian woman out of the eattery and into my house. The break down included her being in a dog collar chained to the wall. But my friends who saw this as an enjoyable night out realized I was freaking out. My rasping breath is a massive indication I am about to do something people would consider a crime. My friends take me to a booth and get me some water and after I calm down my friend Lance says "" This is getting real guys. Did you see his reaction to her? "" Lisa says "" Yeah I saw freaking out and I know that isn't good. "" She knows from first hand experience about that after she appeared in front of me wearing just a towel and touched my arm. This was done for laughs in front of my other friends. They found my reactions interesting. But the moment she touched my arm and asked "" Are you uneasy? "" I reacted by simply yanking her towel off in front of everyone and kissing right on the mouth as she stood there in shock. So Lisa knows that me freaking out isn't good. After a moment I recover and we order some food. As were are eating Lance drops his plastic fork onto his plate and says "" I got a brilliant idea. Lets get wolf here and that mascot together. "" Lisa say "" No fucking way. He can't handle that and you know it will end badly. Now I had returned to my normal emotions are masked state. Normally my emotions are consealed. But any contact triggers a lust response and my instant lust response that is a gate way to other emotions. So being indifferent I said "" do what you want. ""

Lance got his entire social media network working on this.

Unlike other people Lance is selective about who he allows into his social media and has formed a group of locals who he can have lunch with or dinner with just like now. Lance also has an odd thing he does. Do you know when you buy a kid a gift and feel happy when the kid is over joyed. Lance had this same reaction but to the extreme. We joked that lance had an orgasm when helping people. We once joked that if a woman was unable to have a child because her husband was having sperm troubles. Lance would impregnate her on the first try without any pleasure during or after. But the moment she announced she was pregnant and how everyone was happy about it. Lance would be overcome with orgasmic light and fade into nothing until he was needed again.

After we finish our meal and headed to Lisa's to watch TV. Lance went home and got started collecting information and giving people task. Lance would have people go into the eatery and while in ear shot say "" Wolf was so nice today. "" Yes my friend call me wolf. A is working and keeps hearing about this man wolf and about how awesome he is. After two months of this on a daily basis Lance has us return to the eatery for dinner..Lance starts joking about my previous visit and we start talking while waiting for our stir fry Eventually A realized they were calling me wolf and remember all the gossip. She comes over and starts to ask questions. Lance interrupted by saying "" If you want to know more about wolf why not be his girlfriend? "". There was a silence and I saw lance waiting for her response. She gave me a once over and said "" I don't get involved with consumers. "" Before she could finish Lance says "" Lets go! "" We follow Lances lead leave and as we are on the side walk A says "" Your food? "" Lance looks her dead in face and says "" Put it in a container to go and give it o wolf. I asked you an honest question and you quote company policy at me. I thought this was a friendly family place so we could have an honest conversation. I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN. We will never be your consumers ever again. Following his logic I agree and make an angry face. We wait outside and A bring us our food. I hand A 30 dollars and turn to leave. Lance says "" I expect an apology for wolf written and mailed before we will return. "" Lance hands her his old school business card and we leave.

I was disappointed that lance failed at his task. Lance gets depressed when he fails at helping people. Lance shares the results with his social media group. people in his group know of me but they are angry that lance is upset. They act out and spread the word. people who normally don't give a fuck about anyone suddenly hear lance is upset that his helping didn't work. These people were pissed off. The most vocal was Lances mother. Her reaction was pure entitled. She hears that a young lady who is forced to work all day in a eatery was offered a relaxed evening of snacks and movies as a way to assist her in a hectic time in her life. But that this ungrateful girl refused by quoting from a food chain policy rule book. Lances mother had a local freeze out business dropped. A of course was also tending to the eatery facebook page. Tons of messages poor in about me. They asked why did they refuse Lances request and why they lied to everyone about being family owned.

Losing money by the day and gaining negative attention from Lances mother. A went to Lances house and asked lance to accept her apology and end the freeze out. Lance had me come over when A first arrived after stalling for time for ten minutes by saying how offended he was by her response. The moment I arrive Lance brings her over to me and has me hold her in my arms. The moment is surreal. A looks directly up at me confused. Lance says "" You are wolf's girlfriend. Wolf is your boyfriend You will be a couple and love each other. "" I feel A relaxing to my arms and accepting what Lance said to her. Lances mother is smiling at her sons good deed. Suddenly A says "" But my father says I can't date Consumers. "" Lances mom interjects "" He hasn't eaten there for months he isn't a consumer. "" A agrees with that and nods. Lance and his mother nods as well. Lance ends this moment with a cheesy gesture. He hugs the both of us.

Why do I call my GF by the letter A? Her name is written 愛魅力的な....Which is Attractive lover or something. Most people here her names meaning and say "" Awwww that's so cute. "" So I started calling her All but she insisted I just call her A instead. But I rarely use that name given I call her by pet names like cutie and good girl plus many others all the time.

Yes we have stayed together. Even with a forceful start we started to get along and I helped her out with a lot of things until we forged an emotion connection due to advice Lance gave her. "" Whenever you speak to wolf make sure you have his attention. You can do so by holding his hand or something."" Lance knew about my childhood given he was an old friend and knew what she needed to do to forge a real connection",Wolf-man-420,t2_2q3l1dks,0.5,0,9

>The complaint alleges that the commanding officer was often intoxicated and would kiss and lick the undercover female officers. After the operations, both he and another officer would allegedly make inappropriate comments.

There are other allegations in the suit, but this is the headlining issue. The most interesting part of the story is the dissonance in the response from the constiple's office:

>“I have a zero-tolerance stance against sexual assault and sexual harassment and would never allow a hostile work environment as alleged,"" Rosen said. “This lawsuit is an effort to impugn the good reputation of the hard-working men and women of the Precinct One Constable’s Office. I believe our system of due process works and that justice and truth will prevail as facts in this case come to light.""

It's noteworthy that Rosen doesn't deny that these stings occurred, but that whatever did occur was not ""a hostile work environment"". 

>""My sensitivity toward victims remains our highest priority. To this day, not one of these plaintiffs has ever made a formal complaint,"" Rosen said. ""Each employee interviewed was given the opportunity, in a safe environment, to express any concerns. Their own interview statements contradict many of the allegations in the lawsuit.""

The women included in the suit didn't seem to find this workplace as accommodating as Rosen thinks they should:

>When the women spoke up, they “were ridiculed by their commanders, retaliated against by their abusers, and quietly reassigned to less prestigious duties,” the suit claims.

>The complaint also claims that a fourth woman, Jacquelyn Aluotto, who worked as a human trafficking advocate in the unit, was ignored when she raised concerns about the sting operations. She was then fired after giving an interview to internal affairs about the harassment, assault and bullying in the unit, according to the suit.

If the women in the suit are to believed, their working environment was hardly one of impartiality towards accusations workplace harassment. Instead it seems they were punished for speaking out about the demeaning and abusive treatment they were being asked to undergo. This abuse was enabled by the same people who make the judgement of what the department should view as ""a hostile work environment"". 

Some questions for thought:

1. If a workplace tolerates practices that enables the abuse of female coworkers, can we expect these workplaces to be responsive to claims of harrassment?

2. These women signed up for this job. Do they have a right to raise issues with how they were treated during these sting operations?

3. What sexist attitudes or behaviors have you seen normalized in your own workplace? Do people ever speak up? How are they treated if they do?",adamschaub,t2_kiyz9,0.86,25,12

The point I want to make isn't directly related to that discussion so I though I'd start a new one. It's also related to something that came up [a little while ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/38zn56/what_makes_a_woman/cs1ql1p) in another discussion.

> Actually, yes. Studies show that at worplace women receive more status and respect while dressing in a gender-neutral suit than in a (professional-looking, not attention-catching, not provocative or revealing in any way) dress or skirt. A woman who's dressed in a very feminine way is often taken less seriously.

In business, men have exactly one fashion option. A suit. That is the only thing which is considered professional attire for men.

It's it in some cases considered acceptable to wear just trousers and a shirt. However, the higher levels of management will still wear complete suits. In fact, among men, in many offices it is possible to judge someone's rank quite accurately by what they wear. The guy who works the mail room will wear a short-sleeve shirt. Above him, you'll get guys in long-sleeved shirts, above them long-sleeved shirts and ties. What a man wears signals to others his importance and how seriously he should be taken.

A great number of other clothing options are tolerated for women. I assume that this is because, when women first entered the business world, there was no such thing as business wear for women. Casual styles were adapted for office wear. Now women have their own styles of business suits but are still allowed the more casual options such as dresses.

The first part definitely applies to me.  Being the only man in a room full of women has never bothered me, and while ""ecstatic"" is certainly exaggerated, it usually gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling, yes.  By contrast, whenever I am in a male-only group, something is ""missing"", and I start wondering if we might have done something wrong that scared women away.

On the other hand, women seem to be much more likely to seek the exclusive company of each other, and if there is only one woman in a group, I instinctively worry if she is treated well.  How do women actually feel about this situation?  Is it really ""terrifying""?",GaborFrame,t2_dr0qy5,0.83,27,61

I hesitated trying to decide whether or not to do this since it's really long. But of course you don't have to read every single point. So, if you think any of the points (mine or Beckett's) are good or bad, feel free to discuss those

1. **Before explaining something to a woman, ask yourself if she might already understand. She may know more about it than you do.** When explaining something to a person in general, it makes sense to ask what they know first. That's why some teachers give pre-quizzes

2. **Related: Never, ever try to explain feminism to a woman.** It seems sexist to assume all women know more about feminism than all men. Feminism is an ideology, not a gender identity

3. **Trans women are women. Repeat that until you perish.** I don't have strong opinions on trans adults

4. **RESPECT PEOPLE’S PRONOUNS. It’s not hard.** I'm not going to antagonize someone by calling them something I know they don't like

5. **Remember that fat women exist and aren’t all trying to get thin. Treat them with respect.** People can choose to treat their own body how they wish

6. **In fact, just never comment on a woman's body.** While we're at it, comments about a man being short, being a 'neck beard', or having a 'micropenis' could also stop

7. **Be kind to women in customer service positions. Tip them extra. (But not in a creepy way.)** Why extra? That's not equality

8. **Trust women. When they teach you something, don't feel the need to go and check for yourself. And especially do not Google it in front of them.** Gender aside, unquestioningly believing information is not a good idea, and it doesn't all of a sudden become a good idea when it's a woman giving you the information. She's not infallible; she could be wrong

9. **Don’t maintain a double standard for...anything, ever.** It would be nice if she meant it, but already there're double standards in this list (esp. #7 and #92)

10. **CLOSE YOUR LEGS ON PUBLIC TRANSIT, OH MY GOD.** Also [keep your gigantic handbags](http://seathogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/dc-metro-sloppy-seathog.jpg) on your lap; sit up, [don't lie down](https://k60.kn3.net/taringa/F/A/5/5/C/0/Punk_and_roll/6F1.jpg); and [keep your feet off the seat](https://cs6.pikabu.ru/post_img/big/2017/05/22/7/14954511791100268688.jpg)

11. **Trying to describe a woman positively? Say she's ""talented,"" ""clever,"" or ""funny."" Not ""gorgeous,"" ""sweet,"" or ""cute.""** Context matters, as well as the woman. I think there are plenty of women who wouldn't consider being called ""gorgeous"" insulting

12. **Examine your language when talking about women. Get rid of ""irrational,"" ""dramatic,"" ""bossy,"" and ""badgering"" immediately.** For some people, these words are perfectly accurate descriptions of their behavior. Sometimes it's their behavior that ought to be reexamined

13. **Don't think to yourself, I describe men like that too. A) You probably don't. B) If you do, it's to criticize them for acting like a woman.** A) Baseless assumptions B) Men are more often called things like ""douche bag"", ""asshole"", ""dick"", etc. It's not that men aren't criticized; people just use different terms

14. **Do you love ""fiery"" Latina women? ""Strong"" Black women? ""Mysterious"" Asian women? Stop. Pick up a book on decolonial feminism. Read.** Similar to #11, I wonder how many women would actually be offended if they were called ""strong"" or ""mysterious""

15. **Stop calling women ""feisty."" We don't need a special lady word for ""has an opinion.""** ""Feisty"" doesn't merely mean ""has an opinion"", but besides that it's another thing similar to #14

16. **Recognize women's credibility when you introduce them. ""Donna is lovely"" is much less useful than ""Donna knows shitloads about architecture.""** To be fair, it's easier to say something generic like ""she's lovely"" or ""he's a great guy"" when introducing someone than some clever one-liner specific to this individual person

17. **Think about how you describe the young women in your family. Celebrate them for being funny and smart, not for being pretty and compliant.** Pretty much #11 again, except who the fuck compliments adults for being ""compliant""? I've heard things like ""he's a good boy; very obedient"" in reference to children, not grown women

18. **Examine the way you talk about women you’re attracted to. Fat women, old women, queer, trans, and powerful women are not your ""guilty crush.""** No, they're not

19. **Learn to praise a woman without demonizing other women. ""You're not like other girls"" is not a compliment. I want to be like other girls. Other girls are awesome.** I get her point, though it's not necessarily a gender thing, as I've also heard ""you're not like other men"". And there are certainly plenty of negative stereotypes demonizing men

20. **Share writing by women. Don't paraphrase their work in your own Facebook post to show us all how smart or woke you are. I guarantee the woman said it better in the first place.** There are plenty of less condescending and presumptuous ways to say ""don't plagiarize""

21. **Buy sanitary pads and tampons and donate them to a homeless shelter. Just do it.** While you're at it, donate to prostate cancer research groups and male sexual abuse survivor organizations

22. **How much of what you are watching/reading/listening to was made by women? Gender balance your bookcase.** Or read whatever the fuck you enjoy, which is much less sexist than discarding or selecting things based on gender

23. **Feeling proud of your balanced bookcase? Are there women of color there? Trans, queer, and disabled women? Poor women? Always make sure you’re being intersectional.** Same as #22

24. **Don't buy media that demeans women’s experiences, valorizes violence against women, or excludes them entirely from a cast. It's not enough to oppose those things. You have to actively make them unmarketable.** While you're at it, don't buy media that demean men or normalize violence against men. And the fact that that would eliminate the vast majority of every film or book made is the point

25. **Pay attention to stories with nuanced female characters. It will be interesting, I promise.** Nuanced characters of any gender are always more interesting

26. **If you read stories to a child, swap the genders.** Why stop there? Try mentally swapping the genders of all movies, books, news stories. You might discover something interesting

27. **Watch women's sport. And just call it ""sports.""** Or watch what you want to watch

28. **Withdraw your support from sports clubs, institutions, and companies that protect and employ rapists and abusers.** That's reasonable, though there aren't many places that openly employ convicted rapists in the first place

29. **Stop raving about Woody Allen. I don't care if he shits gold. Find a non-accused-abuser to fanboy over.** Just because author operates on the presumption of guilt, doesn't mean everyone else should

30. **It's General Leia, not princess. The Doctor has a companion, not an assistant. It's Doctor Bartlett, not Mrs Madame First Lady.** I only understand the first reference, and considering she's both a general and a princess either title is appropriate

31. **Cast women in parts written for men. We know how to rule kingdoms, go to war, be, not be, and wait for Godot.** Why, though? Can't women do those things without replacing a specific role written for a man?

32. **Pay for porn.** No. I prefer free, genuine amateur porn

33. **Recognize that sex work is work. Be an advocate for and ally to sex workers without speaking for them.** Personally, I have no strong opinion on sex work, so no reason to either attack or ally with sex workers 

34. **Share political hot takes from women as well as men. They might not be as widely accessible, so look for them.** I don't really share political hot takes from anyone, so whatever

35. **Understand that it was never ""about ethics in journalism.""** Sure, whatever

36. **Speak less in meetings today to make space for your women colleagues to share their thoughts. If you're leading the meeting, make sure women are being heard as much as men.** I think it's always good to give others the chance to talk, though I see no reason for men to speak disproportionately less in favor of women

37. **If a woman makes a good point, say, ""That was a good point."" Don't repeat her point and take credit for it.** Taking credit for others' ideas is not a gender thing

38. **Promote women. Their leadership styles may be different than yours. That's probably a good thing.** Promote whoever is best suited for the role

39. **Recruit women on the same salary as men. Even if they don't ask for it.** She seems to lack an understanding of how either business or negotiation works. Employers will pay the least they reasonably can to increase their own profits. You can't expect them to pay someone who doesn't negotiate as much as someone who does. They have no incentive to do so

40. **Open doors for women with caring responsibilities by offering flexible employment contracts.** Similar to #39, employers have less incentive to hire a person on flexible employment than to hire a stable, reliable employee. It's the nature of working for someone else. Be self-employed if you want complete flexibility

41. **If you meet a man and a woman at work, do not assume the man is the superior for literally no reason.** Literally, who actually does this in the first place?

42. **If you're wrongly assumed to be more experienced than a woman colleague, correct that person and pass the platform to the woman who knows more.** Sure, whatever

43. **Make a round of tea for the office.** I'm the only person I work with who prefers tea to coffee, but perhaps that's beside the point

44. **Wash it up.** I wish more men and women knew to clean up after themselves

45. **If you find you're only interviewing men for a role, rewrite the job listing so that it’s more welcoming to women.** A neutral job listing is less sexist than one that specifically shows preference towards a certain gender. If more men are applying it could simply be that more men are interested, and there's nothing wrong with that

46. **Make sure you have women on your interview panel.** Or whoever's most qualified. For something supposedly for gender equality, I'm having to say that quite a lot

47. **Tell female colleagues what your salary is.** That's entirely no one's business but my own

48. **Make sure there's childcare at your events.** I'm not sure it's the company's job for parents to have arrangements for their children

49. **Don't schedule breakfast meetings during the school run.** Similar to #48

50. **If you manage a team, make sure that your employees know that you recognize period pain and cystitis as legitimate reasons for a sick day.** Things like this would just make employers very reluctant to hire women

51. **If you have a strict boss (or mom or teacher) who is a woman, she is not a ""bitch."" Grow up.** Similar to #12. Maybe don't be a bitch

52. ""*Expect a woman to do the stuff that's in her job description. Not the other miscellaneous shit you don't know how to do yourself.*"" Indeed. And also don't expect men to carry heavy things for you because you can't do it yourself

53. **Refuse to speak on an all-male panel.** If people are chosen based on their qualifications, and the most qualified people to talk on this panel happen to be male, then it would be more sexist not to talk on the panel specifically because they're male

54. **In a Q&A session, only put your hand up if you have A QUESTION. Others didn’t attend to listen to you.** Not a gender thing

55. **If you have friends or family members who use slurs or discriminate against trans or non-binary people, sit them down and explain why they must stop. (This goes for cis women, too.)** I agree prejudice is bad. Though I don't think it's people's job to monitor other's speech

56. **If you have friends or family members who use slurs or discriminate against women of other races, sit them down and explain why they must stop. (This goes for white women, too.)** Similar to #55

57. **If you see women with their hands up, put yours down. This can be taken as a metaphor for a lot of things. Think about it.** Prioritizing women is not equality. Usually, the speaker will call on everyone with their hands up anyway. If not, priority is to whoever had it up first

58. **Raising a feminist daughter means she's going to disagree with you. And probably be right. Feel proud, not threatened.** A) Why would I do that? B) Being a feminist doesn't equate being right

59. **Teach your sons to listen to girls, give them space, believe them, and elevate them.** Boys and girls could all be taught to be better listeners; no one must be believed automatically; girls don't deserve to be put on a pedestal just for being girls

60. **Dads, buy your daughter tampons, make her hot water bottles, wash her bras. Show her that her body isn't something to be ashamed of.** Sure. Not personally relevant to me

61. **But dads, do not try to iron her bras. This is a mistake you will only make once.** I didn't know that was a thing

62. **Examine how domestic labor is divided in your home. Who does the cleaning, the childcare, the organizing, the meal budgeting? Sons, this goes for you, too.** That's a personal matter every household should decide for itself

63. **Learn how to do domestic tasks to a high standard. ""I'd only do it wrong"" is a bullshit excuse.** Similar to #62

64. **Never again comment on how long it takes a woman to get ready. WE ARE TRYING TO MEET THE RIDICULOUS STANDARDS OF A SYSTEM YOU BENEFIT FROM.** A) I didn't ask you to. That's your choice and your problem B) In any way that men benefit from the ""system"", there several ways in which men are disadvantaged by it. Male privilege is not the unquestionable fact she's treating it as

65. **Challenge the patriarchs in your religious group when they enable the oppression of women.** There are no patriarchs in my religious group oppressing women

66. **Challenge the patriarchs in your secular movement when they enable the oppression of women.** Similar to #65, more baseless presumptions

67. **Trust women's religious choices. Don't pretend to liberate them just so you can criticise their beliefs.** I don't concern myself with others' religious choices anyway

68. **Examine who books your trips, arranges outings, organizes Christmas, buys birthday cards. Is it a woman? IS IT?** No, it's not

69. **And if it is actually you, a man, don't even dare get in touch with me looking for your medal.** Presuming I'm concerned about getting approval for how I live my life. I think many of these can be summarized down to strawmen and presumptions

70. **Take stock of the emotional labor you expect from women. Do you turn to the women around you for emotional support and give nothing in return?** Definitely, 100% not a gender thing. I know far too many women who also use men as their emotional tampons

71. **Remember that loving your mom/sister/girlfriend is not the same as giving up your own privilege to progress equality for women. And that gender inequality extends beyond the women in your direct social group.** Presuming that there's male privilege

72. **Don’t assume that all women are attracted to men.** Likewise, don't assume all men are ""after one thing""

73. **Don’t assume that a woman in public wants to talk to you just because she’s in public.** Not a gender thing. Sometimes random people like to talk to other people in public

74. **If a woman tells you she was raped, assaulted, or abused, don't ask her for proof. Ask how you can support her.** Sure, but also very much not a gender thing

75. **If you see a friend or colleague being inappropriate to a woman, call him out. You will survive the awkwardness, I promise.** Calling out friends for inappropriate behavior is, again, not a gender thing

76. **Repeat after me: Always. Hold. Men. Accountable. For. Their. Actions.** For the most part, they already are. In fact, [statistically it seems more likely](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144002) that it's women who are disproportionately given passes for their bad behavior

77. **Do not walk too close to a woman late at night. That shit can be scary.** I'm not going to be walking right up on someone in general, anyway. But if your ""too close"" is a hundred feet, your paranoia is not my concern

78. **If you see a woman being followed or otherwise bothered by a stranger, stick around to make sure she’s safe.** It's nice for people to look out for each other, but A) as usual, it's not a gendered thing, especially since a man is no less likely to be mugged / assaulted by a stranger than a woman is B) it's not men's responsibility. For a feminist article, this sounds a lot like enforcing traditional gender roles

79. **This should go without saying: Do not yell unsolicited ""compliments"" at women on the street. Or anywhere.** Sure, whatever

80. **If you are a queer man, recognize that your sexuality doesn’t exclude you from potential misogyny.** Anyone of any gender can be misogynistic or misandric. It's not limited to men, nor misogyny

81. **If you are a queer man, recognize that your queer women or non-binary friends may not feel comfortable in a male-dominated space, even if it’s dominated by queer men.** If someone feels uncomfortable in a space, she's perfectly free to leave. I'm not sure why the men in that space have to make adjustments 

82. **Be happy to have women friends without needing them to want to sleep with you. The ""friend zone"" is not a thing. We do not owe you sex.** Likewise, women: don't believe the myth that all men are trying to get into your pants. Not every man is interested in sex with you or with women in general for that matter. You're not entitled to sex, and it's not cute to touch men without their permission

83. **Remember that you can lack consent in situations not involving sex—such as when pursuing uninterested women or forcing a hug on a colleague.** Forcing hugs is *definitely* not something only men need to be told. If I had a dollar for every time a woman hugged me without permission, I'd be worth as much as Bill Gates

84. **Champion sex positive women but don't expect them to have sex with you.** I think I already addressed the whole entitlement thing

85. **Trust a woman to know her own body. If she says she won't enjoy part of your sexual repertoire, do not try to convince her otherwise.** Likewise, if a guy says [he wont like period sex](https://www.pornhub.com/sex/flex-period-sex/), don't try to [convince him otherwise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK4nCruWgJ8&feature=youtu.be). Don't try to make people do sex acts they don't want. Not a gender thing

86. **Be sensitive to nonverbal cues from women, especially around sex. We’re not just being awkward for no reason. (You read ""Cat Person,"" didn’t you?)** It's not men's job to be a mind reader. Perhaps she should try communicating her feelings better

87. **It is not cute to try to persuade a woman to have sex with you. EVER. AT ALL. Go home.** Another entirely non-gendered thing. Since when has trying to seduce people into sex been specifically a man thing?

88. **Same goes for pressuring women to have sex without a condom. Go. Home. And masturbate.** Same goes with pressuring men to have sex without a condom. Or lying about being on birth control. Or poking holes in his condom. Or stealing his sperm. Or faking a pregnancy entirely

89. **Accidentally impregnated a women who doesn't want a kid? Abortions cost money. Pay for half of it.** So abortion is half his responsibility? Alright then

90. **Accidentally came inside a woman without protection? Plan B is expensive. Pay for all of it.** Unless he raped her, she willingly had sex with him without birth control, and she agreed to allow him to not wear a condom, so it's not entirely his responsibility and she should still pay half

91. **Get STD tested. Regularly. Without having to be asked.** 1,000% not a gender thing

92. **Examine your opinion on abortion. Then put it in a box. Because, honestly, it's completely irrelevant.** If his rights on abortion are completely irrelevant, then his responsibility for paying for abortion are completely 0. Yet according to #89, his responsibility is half. He can't both be responsible for paying for abortion and also have no right to an opinion on abortion

93. **Understand that disabled women are whole, sexual human beings. Listen to and respect them.** Again, making non-gendered things into gendered things

94. **Understand that not all women have periods or vaginas.** Sure, whatever

95. **Believe women's pain. Periods hurt. Endometriosis is real. Polycystic ovaries, vaginal pain, cystitis. These things are real. Hysteria isn’t.** Men don't know women's pain. Women don't know men's pain. People don't know others' experiences. Etc. Still not a gendered issue

96. **If a woman accidentally bleeds on you, try your absolute best to just keep your shit together.** It's not unreasonable for people to become upset about getting others' blood on them, nor is it a gender thing. You never know what diseases that person's carrying

97. **Lobby your elected officials to implement high quality sex education in schools.** Sure, that could be helpful

98. **Uplift young Black and Indigenous girls at every possible opportunity. No excuses.** While you're at it, uplift boys and young men, too many of who are dropping out of school, performing poorly while in school, and not getting degrees 

99. **Do not ever assume you know what it’s like.** That 10,000% goes both ways

100. **Mainly, just listen to women. Listen to us and believe us. It’s the only place to start if you actually want all women to have a ""Happy International Women’s Day.""** Everyone should learn to listen better. Not everyone should believe everything they hear. It's not a gender thing",HeForeverBleeds,t2_r7hjs,0.73,15,79
889,46vg8i,2016-02-21,FeMRADebates,"""What If Your Boss Is a Woman? Work Organization, Work-Life Balance and Gender Discrimination at the Workplace""","Abstract from the [free full-text PDF](http://ftp.iza.org/dp9737.pdf) (highlights mine):

> In this paper, we investigate the association between female leadership, work organization practices and perceived gender discrimination within firms. Using data for 30 European countries for the period 1995-2010, we find that having *a female “boss” is associated with lower overall gender discrimination at work.* The female boss effect, however, differs across gender: it is associated with lower discrimination among female employees, but higher among male employees. We also investigate the underlying mechanisms that shape gender discrimination within firms. *We find evidence of a “women helping women” pattern through spill-over effects which reduce discrimination among women, but increase discrimination among men, particularly in female-dominated jobs.* A better balance between work and life, a supportive work environment and flexible working time, particularly for women in high-skilled jobs, are shown to be effective in reducing gender discrimination. The above findings are robust to a number of specification changes and different sub-populations in our sample. Further, similar results are found when more traditional measures of gender imbalance, such as wages or career prospects, are used. Finally, to account for potential endogeneity and selection, arising from the non-random distribution of females in higher-rank jobs, we jointly estimate the selection process and the discrimination equation, finding support for a causal interpretation of the results.

891,wzopaf,2022-08-28,FeMRADebates,I am a woman. I have marched in feminist protests. I have volunteered my time and labor for feminist charities. I have been involved with several feminist groups. This is the story of why I stopped considering myself a feminist.,"For some context. I am pursuing a career in academia. I'd prefer not to go too much into detail as I value my privacy. But I have spent ample time throughout the institution I both attend and work for in multiple roles. 

My journey to where I find myself today started a few weeks before the creation of this account. A few close male peers of mine opened up to me about their experiences of sexism at the hands of a few members of one a feminist students advocacy group. At first I did not believe them as I believed that sexism in any form was a direct opposition to egalitarian values. And being that they had pointed towards a group that had defined themselves by those values as the culprit I felt that there must be more to the story. 

So I asked around. And I found that the members of this group that had been sexist towards my male peers openly admitted to it. Citing my male peers making ""MRA Arguments"" I then through further digging found that these ""MRA arguments"" had to do with domestic abuse and a lack of resources for male victims. 

Something my own later research found to be a legitimate issue. Which raised the question as to why my peers were dismissed and body shamed for bringing it up. I had heard of MRA's before but I never really looked into them. So I decided to do some digging. For a while I lurked around in MRA and feminist forums. And then I decided to pull the proverbial trigger and join in on a few forums like this one that brought the two groups together in discussion. 

though I was certainly aiming to change my mind with new information. I did not expect things to be so abrupt. I was given warm (though often skeptical or distrusting) welcomes from the MRA's I interacted with. While the feminists I interacted with were often rather harsh. I often felt as though I was brushed off for simply not ""knowing enough"" to agree with them outright. Often my questions or critiques were met with accusations of misogyny or malicious intent. Though to be fair both sides were consistently skeptical of malicious intent. I later learned of just how common it is to have one's words twisted. So I understand at some level the skepticism. 

But one underlying issue truly ""caught"" me. And that is the logic and rhetoric used by either side. 

On the feminist side there are decades of academic roots that are deeply entrenched. And while this is undoubtedly a good foundation. I also found that there are many egregious cracks in said foundation. There are a number of well documented but rarely spoken of fallacies throughout this area of academia. From ad hoc rationalizations to confirmation bias to unfalsifiable theories. To quote one MRA I found online 

>Feminist theory defines patriarchy as an unjust social system that enforces gender roles and is oppressive to both men and women.%5B32%5D It often includes any social mechanism that evokes male dominance over women. Feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction, which can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations.%5B33%5D


>So Patriarchy is oppressive to both men and women? But if so then the definition seems relatively gender neutral while the term Patriarchy is not gender neutral. So if our society is oppressive to both men and women then couldn't you just as easily describe our society as a Matriarchy? The equivalent definition for Matriarchy would be:

>An unjust social system that enforces gender roles and is oppressive to both men and women.%5B32%5D It often includes any social mechanism that evokes female dominance over men.


>So we just need 1 case of a social mechanism that evokes female dominance over men to satisfy the definition of Matriarchy? Well one example would be the social expectation where males pay for dates. So the definition of Matriarchy is satisfied so we must live in a Matriarchy.

>But if the definitions of both Patriarchy and Matriarchy are satisfied, then do we live in both a Matriarchy and a Patriarchy at the same time? Why should we describe our society as a Patriarchy rather than a Matriarchy? And if the definitions are relatively gender neutral, then why not use a gender neutral term like Traditionalism instead?

>To this I turn to the scientific philosopher Karl Popper. In science a theory is called falsifiable if it is possible to conceive an observation or an argument which proves the statement in question to be false. In this sense, falsify is synonymous with nullify, meaning not ""to commit fraud"" but ""show to be false"". Some philosophers argue that science must be falsifiable.

>Falsifiability is very important in science because it means you can test predictions and either verify or falsify a theory to obtain a better understanding of reality. Without falsifiability, how can we exclude absurd hypothesis from our set of scientific beliefs such as the idea that a giant flying spaghetti monster created everything? Is the feminist theory of patriarchy falsifiable? What testable predictions does it make that cannot also be explained by Matriarchy?

This is just one example of the issues I started to find. This is not to say that there aren't issues on the MRA side. But largely those issues are a lack of presence and roots in academia. The MRM is largely not rooted in academia like feminists so they don’t have the same strict academic discipline in their language and models, which makes it easy to mock and shoot down. Picture a 40 year old feminist with a lifetime of training in academia and research and activism cutting down young boys and men with legitimate and unaddressed issues and trauma's. Yet the former group feels as though they are punching up but as they now populate highest offices media and academia, they are in fact punching down.

What I also found was that where there WAS academic backing to MRA ideas. It often stood up well to criticism and did a better job of explaining issues on a grander scale than I felt feminist explanations did. And then comes the pole that pushed me off the proverbial plank. 

Dogmatism, Bias and an unwillingness to consider alternative ideas. 

this may be relying too much on proverbs. But this truly was the final nail in the coffin for me. Many of the feminists I spoke with online had an underlying issue wherein any critique of feminism was treated as an attack on women. Yet there are numerous sly and somewhat underhanded terms, beliefs and theories I encountered about men that are outright misandrist. Yet consistently whenever this was pointed out by anybody (myself included) we were dismissed as simply ""not understanding"" The terms ""motte and bailey"" and ""dog whistle"" both come to mind though I don't have the words to adequately pinpoint what I saw. It was simply often the case that things that reflected negatively on men were to be taken in the most generous way while anything that may reflect negatively on women was to be taken in the least generous way. for example. ""Kill all men"" is only ever a joke and nobody should ever feel insulted or hurt by it. But ""don't be a pussy"" is a grave insult against women that demeans femininity by treating female genitalia as something undesirable. 

This is clearly the result of numerous in group biases and outright tribalism. And then even when presented with better alternatives or solid arguments as to why either beliefs were correct or harmful. The result was often a push to either silence the people offering them or the one being offered these things would leave the conversation. The appearance was thoroughly such that ones mind could not and would not be changed regardless of evidence to the contrary. 

I as a person value academic and intellectual integrity. I value solid rationale and being able to adapt to new information. And in the last year of involving myself with feminists and MRA's. I have found that the MRA's consistently offered these things where it was common that feminists did not if not taking the opposite approach. I accept that there are exceptions to both of these. and that this is simply my own anecdotal experience. But it has been enough to personally sway me in such a way that I no longer identify as a feminist",Mysterious_Orchid726,t2_dbr7vlhs,0.9,118,108
892,hwcpii,2020-07-23,FeMRADebates,How do men react toward women in male-dominated fields?,"I am primarily talking about the workplace, but also about other areas.  Certainly there exist men who think that some things are just ""not for women"" and therefore react in a hostile way when a woman enters their field.  When you watch TV from half a century ago, this is pretty commonplace, but I have never personally witnessed a man say anything like that, so I assume that they are either more subtle about it nowadays, or that they still say the same things but less publicly because they know they are bad.

Also, I have heard about women being *scared away* by a certain culture.  This may not be intentional, but maybe just the result of a lack of diversity.  However, a woman who does work in a very male-dominated place said to me:  ""Yes, the way the guys treat each other is pretty rough.  But I noticed that the moment I enter the room, they suddenly change, and they have always been very nice to me.""  This makes sense because even when you talk about ""traditional masculinity"", being kind to women is one of the key expectations.

Especially to the women:  What are your experiences?  If you are in a male-dominated field, how do they treat you?  Have you ever been scared away from something because of the ""bro culture"" in that place?",GaborFrame,t2_dr0qy5,0.91,28,71

>as a female Marine officer, I learned early that our comrades' perceptions of us were often different – and limited. At Officer Candidates School, one female sergeant instructor stalked through the squad bay and yelled at our sixty-woman platoon, ""If you're a woman in the Marine Corps,"" she hollered, ""you're either a bitch, a dyke, or a ho."" 

>Having grown up with only brothers, I identified with the guys. There is a little-known fourth option to the bitch-dyke-ho trifecta: everyone's kid sister.

>I kept my few relationships low-profile. I cut off my vestigial femininity and buried all emotions other than anger. These tactics worked; professionally, I was well respected. But it came at a price.

>I didn't feel like I could openly be fully human. I was simultaneously ashamed of my plainness yet unwilling to change, lest I be viewed as anything other than highly competent. At the time, I thought less of my fellow female lieutenants who wore sexy Halloween costumes, openly dated other officers, and seemed to effortlessly attract male attention whenever we went out. It was years before I learned the term ""slut-shaming;"" all I knew was that I was unwilling to risk their level of vulnerability. To be perceived as sexually desirable – especially in front of fellow Marines – felt like a sign of weakness. This double bind can especially trap military women, who walk a razor’s edge if they display femininity while working under a microscope of potential male attention.

>much of our military's culture is predicated on gendered shame. Puritanical American attitudes still shame women who exhibit any form of sexual agency – who act on their desires and revel in their bodies, rather than passively and modestly awaiting admiration. For men, it’s the flip side of the same coin...Anything less than total domination, the ethos goes, is shamefully unmanly.
Combined with social media and GPS, the stakes of gender-based shame are high. The danger isn't just from posting photos; sites like Marines United enable stalking and harassment by listing women's names, ranks and duty stations.

900,4lp6l0,2016-05-30,FeMRADebates,Sexism at workplace,"I have a friend (male) who recently complained to me about double standards at his work place.  Apparently the team leads are all very very lenient with female workers, whereas they are much more strict with the males.  The specific example he gave me was cell phone usage in his area, in that you are not allowed to use them at all.  However, *literally every woman* in his area play on their cell phones during work hours.  He once tried to use his to read during downtime at work.  One of the female leads, who uses her cell phone while working nearly every day, even ordered him to put his away.  

What can he do about something like this?  Is it even worthwhile to pursue?  He said he had other examples, but we didn't talk about it for long.  As an aside, I asked him after he complained also about less-senior female workers being promoted over him (true story believe it or not) ""Do you know what Patriarchy is, son?"" ""No I don't know anything about that.""  

Pretty sure nothing could be done of it, even if he wanted to pursue it somehow.  Still shitty, and still would like thoughts and opinions.  ",KRosen333,t2_6hvx6,0.88,21,15

906,6mko0p,2017-07-11,FeMRADebates,Should Women Get Paid Menstrual Leave? (The Current at CBC),"In [this June 14 segment of The Current for June 14,](http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-june-14-2017-1.4158414/should-women-get-paid-menstrual-leave-1.4158421) (unsecure link FYI, secure mp3 link below) Anna Maria Tremonti interviews several women menstruation researchers and advocates for paid menstrual leave.

It was an interesting discussion, though marred by the overwhelming mainstream feminist bias that dominates almost all neoliberal media coverage of gender issues. (An MRA perspective is raised only to be shot down, and of course no MRA or even male voice is heard in the episode.) To be fair, Anna does push back some against the notion of paid menstrual leave, asking why menstrual symptoms sufficient to interfere with work wouldn't properly be covered by sick leave. (I don't think anyone holding the view that sick leave should suffice will be satisfied with any of the responses given to the question.)

The question of how a business might weigh the responsibility of providing additional paid leave of 5% to 14% (1 to 3 days per month) to potential female employees vs. potential male employees is never directly addressed. Or, to put it another way, a business would be looking at a significant likelihood that a pre-menopausal woman would potentially be 5% to 14% less productive during some/many/all months than a male employee. This seems like a prescription for incentivizing pay and/or hiring bias.

It seems to me that a special sex-based leave policy is a bad approach to the issue. After all, many women are able to soldier through their cycles without letting them impact their productivity.

Instead of a dedicated menstrual leave policy, I think the best approach for the economy as a whole would be a dramatic decrease in everyone's working hours and an increase in workplace flexibility. This would greatly benefit those caring for dependents (including both children and aging parents) as well as those who might be experiencing recurring health issues of any nature — whether they were migraines, menstrual cramps, or whatever — and increase the total number of jobs to be filled, which would benefit the millions of long-term unemployed. All of this would be accomplished without generating the hiring/pay bias and inevitable resentment and workplace friction that would result from bestowing a sex-specific form of paid leave.

907,113lq8q,2023-02-16,FeMRADebates,the overuse of certain language and its effects.,"Does anyone else feel that certain descriptive words and language are now used so much in our society that it has got to a point the impact or meaning of the word has been diluted to the point where it doesn't have the desired effect or seriousness that should come with it? 

&#x200B;

I'll give some examples. 

Sexist - sexist to me is proper misogyny, you know the guy who thinks women only belong in the kitchen and women shouldn't be heard, women don't belong in the workplace, basically that women are second-class citizens to men this is the type of guy I think of when I hear sexist/misogynist but then we hear the word used to describe a guy who called a woman bitch for example. he might not hold any other sexist ideas but in the heat of that moment he called a woman that name and now he's the sexist?

Transphobe - again someone who actively hates and discriminates against trans people, wants to exclude them from society, and physically hurts them in some way. this is what I think when I hear the word and the reaction is visceral, I feel empathy for the movement and want to help put these bigots away for a long time. But then I hear you are transphobic if you are a cis straight male and refuse to date a trans woman. this just makes me feel really? wasn't the full idea of LGBTQ+ so that people can be true to their own sexuality and hear you're calling someone a terrible name because they won't be with a certain group? 

these are just two examples to show what I mean, but I see these in everything from racist to homophobe to the point where MRA is used as an insult from feminists or that feminists are now at least in part as ""angry blue haired sjw's"". 

Im not saying nobody should use these words but I do feel they are used to a point where if someone tells me don't go near him he is a rapist, I'm now at a point I think ok did he actually rape someone, or is this he done or even just said something that in years past someone would have called him a dick but in today's standards he's a rapist?

Im Scottish and we used words in out dialect and society that would be deemed very rude and inappropriate in other English-speaking countries, would that deserve me to be called sexist, bigoted, etc if someone heard me say those words and didn't consider my origins? 

I'm genuinely interested in people's thoughts on this, am I just being pedantic? or is other people feeling the same? If so what are the ways we could look at to resolve the issue, with more words added for severity? perhaps better education on the use of the English language to people?   let me hear your thoughts :)",Menzies56,t2_2m3q65au,0.96,24,51
908,7mg1yd,2017-12-27,FeMRADebates,Being complicit in the sexual harassment and assault of others,"I recently read [this article](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/12/judge_alex_kozinski_made_us_all_victims_and_accomplices.html), and it was not a comfortable experience--it wasn't something I'd *never* thought of before, but this year's sexual-harassment-as-an-endemic-workplace-thing explosion certainly had me thinking of it all more *pointedly* than I'd ever done before, in some ways. Mostly, ouch!

>And still, I am aware as I write this that I should have found my footing, that the women who came up after me, and who spoke up, are manifestly braver than I was. I am further aware that my failure to speak up over the course of my career is part of the reason why it was possible for the women who came after me to be treated as disrespectfully as they were.

>Everybody knew. This is the problem with a system of “open secrets.” All the clerks and former clerks in Kozinski’s ambit knew and understood that you assumed the risk and accepted the responsibilities of secrecy...Our silence became tacit approval.

>I was implicated. We all are, our professional contributions weighed on scales of fuckability and willingness to go along, to be good sports, to not be humorless scolds or office gorgons.

>But if this moment is going to mean anything, it has to make room for the realization that every last one of us who gave cover to this type of systematic degradation and abuse of power is at the very least responsible for calling it out for what it was. We are also responsible for apologizing, and figuring out how we can start to do better. 

>For years, I excused myself because I believed that the casual degradation of women that emanated from Judge Kozinski’s orbit was the death rattle of an old America...It’s disturbing to realize that, even today, the main markers I relied on to confirm Kozinski’s bad behavior were the shocked reactions of normal, good men: my husband, my friend, my co-clerk. Sure, I felt dirty after each interaction, but my feelings didn’t feel like enough.

>I always figured I would feel better when Judge Kozinski’s #MeToo came home to roost. I don’t. His reactions to the accusers—belittling their allegations, shaming Bond for writing sex scenes in romance novels—were the reactions I was trying to avoid bringing down on myself when I failed to insist that Article III judges not talk to and about women this way, not at work, and not as we struggled to find purchase in the profession of our choosing. Somewhere along the way I managed to create a career for myself. In part, I did it by keeping secrets.

So, *very* uncomfortable...as a woman who has always been part of a traditionally manly world professionally, of course I've done the same thing.  We *all* have, I suspect--all of us who have succeeded in it, anyway.  There wasn't any other path--I don't actually know of a single woman who kicked up a fuss, either on her own behalf or another woman's behalf, either in the military or in the world of engineers and machine shops, who went on to have a successful career in any of those things.  We all colluded, for all the reasons outlined above.  I can't say that all women had the same feelings about it, either then or now, that I did and do--but I *can* safely say that we all colluded.  

I expect that's part of the reason I haven't jumped on the ""men are all evil for colluding--for closing their eyes, for pretending not to know what everybody knew, for never once stepping in to stop it, help anybody or just *say* something seriously and publicly, just once!"" bandwagon.  I can't say for sure that it would've destroyed their careers, as it would've destroyed mine, but I can definitely see that it might well have done so--and I can't hold anybody else to a standard I failed so spectacularly to maintain myself.  

Yep, I'm ashamed--ashamed at how I avoided female whistleblowers just like everyone else did; I was never actively unkind, and indeed I was *stealthily* kind to them (even, sometimes, overtly kind--memories of holding a sobbing, soaking wet 18-year-old girl in my arms for an hour at least on the last morning of Army basic training spring strongly to mind).  I developed any number of tactics (still in use!) to avoid ever becoming victimized myself, and on the few occasions they failed to work (they were good tactics--mostly they worked) I *did* stand up for myself...but *only* myself.  I'm sure those few men went on to harass other women; I only took care of *my* situation, I impeded them in their future activities not at all.  

I can't change the past, just the future--which, even with that firm resolution, I *still* feel disingenuous, as my current workplace is probably the least sexist one I've ever been in in my life and it's probably pretty damn safe for me to take this new stance, as it's deeply unlikely to really come up, especially in any *significant* way.  :(  But, it's all I can really do now.  

And of course, am I *really* sorry I didn't destroy my career..?  No.  *Would* I really change what I did, all those many many many times over two decades of professional life, if I could go back now, with my new wisdom and insight...?  I don't know.  Maybe.  Maybe not.  Wow, I suck.

909,19dkgbg,2024-01-23,FeMRADebates,Are there any major ways in which American men have it better than American women?,"I'm asking this here even though it's technically not a debate (although the comment section might turn into a debate) because this is the only subreddit I know of that actually discusses gender issues from both sides (PPD does somewhat, but seems to be focused on dating/relationships/sex and not other gender issues).

From my point of view, it seems men have it far worse than women in America. From routine infant circumcision, to the draft\*, to receiving longer sentences for the same crimes, to being seen as disposable, to being able to get away with a lot less, especially with regards to sexually forward questions/actions than women, etc...

And to be honest, it's really getting me down, that just because of the way I was born, I have to live my whole life as a member of a group that is treated more harshly, judged more harshly, and seen as disposable.

So, are there any major ways in which American men have it better than American women? It has to be something that all or most men benefit from, so it can't be ""most CEOs/billionaires are male"", since that does nothing for the 99.9% of men who aren't CEOs/billionaires. It also can't be something that's merely a biological difference, like ""men can pee standing up more easily""...that's not a societal privilege, that is just the way our plumbing is wired. I wouldn't consider ""can show their nipples in public"" to be a privilege, either. On the contrary, I see it as one of many ways in which a man's privacy and modesty are taken less seriously than a woman's.

910,3grhfm,2015-08-12,FeMRADebates,[Women's Wednesdays] Law Enforcement and Vaginal Searches,"Over on /r/twoxchromosomes, a [story](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-strip-search-public_55c8f940e4b0923c12bdb903) has been posted about a horrific incident in Texas:

>Charnesia Corley, 21, said she was running an errand for her sick mother when a male Harris County sheriff's deputy pulled her over near a Texaco station on June 21 and accused her of running a stop sign. The deputy said he smelled marijuana coming from the car, which in Texas is probable cause to search a vehicle.

>After a fruitless look inside the car, the lawman summoned a female deputy and events spiraled out of control, Corley said.

>""She said, 'No, I don't have any panties on,' so the officer told her to bend over and she pulled her pants down for her and went to stick her hand inside of Ms. Corely,"" Cammack said.

>Corley resisted and the deputies forced her face-first to the ground, Cammack said. The female deputy then climbed onto Corley's back and pinned her, while the officers awaited the arrival of a second female deputy, according to the lawyer. After the second female deputy arrived, the two women officers held Corley down and forcibly spread her legs, Cammack said.

>""One held one leg and the other held the other leg and they stuck their fingers up inside of her,"" said Cammack. ""This was in a Texaco parking lot, where people were walking by and cars were driving by. This was a very busy area.""

>Corely was charged with resisting arrest and possession of marijuana, both misdemeanors. Investigators reportedly said they found 0.02 ounces of marijuana on her.

>The sheriff's office didn't return a call for comment from HuffPost on Monday. In an interview with KTRK News, sheriff's spokesman Thomas Gilleland said no marijuana was located during the search of Corley's vehicle. He added that a deputy wrote in the offense report that Corley consented to the search. 

>Cammack said that he has a copy of the report and that Gilleland ""completely lied"" about the consent. 

>""In the offense report, they put she tried not to let them do it,"" Cammack said. ""That's why they filed the resisting charge. There's nothing in the offense report to suggest she consented.""

Someone in the thread linked to a [similar story](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/troopers-texas-probe-genitals-women-traffic-stops-article-1.1414668) which also occurred in Texas:

>The first video was graphic enough. Two women, as shown in a Texas state trooper’s dash cam recording, are probed in their vaginas and rectums by a glove-wearing female officer after a routine traffic stop near Dallas.

>A few days later, a second video surfaced. It was an eerily similar scenario, but this time the traffic stop was just outside Houston, and with different troopers. Two women, pulled over for allegedly speeding, are subjected to body cavity searches by a female officer summoned to the scene by a male trooper.

>Unlike the earlier tape, this one had clear audio. Yells can be heard as the female trooper shoves her gloved finger inside one woman.

>In both invasive incidents, the female troopers don't change gloves between probes, according to the horrified victims.

>Texas officials say the searches are unconstitutional. So do attorneys for the shaken women, who have filed federal lawsuits.

>But lawyers and civil rights advocates tell the Daily News these cavity searches are really standard policy among the Texas Department of Public Safety’s state troopers, despite their illegality — not to mention that they were conducted on the side of the road in full view of passing motorists.

>There have also been two recent cavity-search controversies in other states: Last year in Florida a Citrus County woman, who’d recently been charged with driving under the influence, was pulled over by sheriff’s deputies while driving with her children. In a federal lawsuit, the woman claimed she was given a cavity search on the roadside; in Milwaukee, police were disciplined after 2012 reports surfaced that eight cops had conducted genital searches on arrested suspects without the legal authority to do so.

So, apparently my company thinks we're not doing enough work, or maybe that the work we do is too ""real"" or something, but somehow, someone, somewhere thought it would be a *great* idea to split us all up into teams and give us each a week to come up with a presentation on a (pre-assigned) ""Core Value.""  If you're not sure what a ""Core Value"" is, you're better off not knowing.  (During the course of this, I found out that the Executive Team, all the company senior VPs and up, spent *two weeks* in a retreat developing our *new* ""Core Values.""  Words cannot begin to describe..!)

I was really glad that somebody *else* on my pre-assigned Core Values presentation team set up a kick-off meeting, because this whole mini-project is about the last thing I ever want to be the person to take initiative on.  So we all showed up, and that person said, very perkily!

""So I was *thinking* and a PowerPoint would be so *boring* and like *everyone else* is probably going to do one and we want *ours* to be different!""

Me, internally behind my politely interested poker face: *No we don't! We didn't volunteer for this, boring is FINE! Why can't we just spend five minutes whipping up a PowerPoint and then get back to actual work?*

""So,"" she continued brightly, ""let's do a SKIT!""

Oh, holy hell.  But it just keeps goin' on downhill from there--

""We're a *really diverse* company,"" she went on, ""and I thought, you know, it'd be nice to reflect that, so we could have each person represent a particular culture, or, you know, GENDER! and then say, 'This is what this Core Value means to *me,* as a, uh, person from India!  or, a woman! or so on!""

NO NO NO, I am NOT going to be known as one of the people in THAT group--but then, I think, if I say something, what if *I* end up having to run this presentation..?  ...eh, has to be done.  So I smiled very nicely at her and said, ""I really think that has a high potential of offending a lot of people with stereotyping.""

""Yes,"" said another team member.

""Yeah,""  said a second team member.

""Good point,"" said a third team member.

Ms. Initiator's perky smile faded and I felt like a giant jerk, but at least not like the giant jerk who would forevermore be known as ""one of the people who did that totally racist and sexist skit for the Core Values project,"" so I managed to get past it.

But, it did occur to me--

I spoke out against ethnic and sexist stereotyping, so was I a good Social Justice warrior today?

I spoke out against incorporating a diversity theme in the workplace, so was I an *anti*-Social Justice warrior today?

913,18vwuzu,2024-01-01,FeMRADebates,"Women should run governments and corporations, men should run households and relationships","This is a theory that's been rattling around in my brain for a few years now. I won't put too many arguments because I'm interested in other's opinions, and please forgive the title, I'm trying to give a pithy summary, when what I actually mean is......

I think about 6-7 out of every 10 positions in government and business leadership would be better filled by women.

Women just don't tend to have the ego that men do. Things seem to go wrong when one man (almost always a man) accumulates too much power and has too much ego. If I'm voting in an election and it's a choice between a man and a woman, everything else being exactly equal, I'd vote for the woman. Women are better at being 'chairman'.

I think in about 66% of families and relationships, it should be accepted and agreed by all members that the eldest male in the household is the ultimate authority. Women can sometimes be emotional terrorists, and I think, in a sense, we all secretly know that everybody would be happier if we could go back to a time when Dad's word was final and everybody stfu and accepted it.

This argument isn't well articulated, but maybe that's a good thing? (he says, trying to convince himself).

915,6wou7j,2017-08-29,FeMRADebates,"Neurodiversity, gender, and recruitment in technical fields","Asperger Syndrome and other Austism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are widely seen as having a significant genetic component and is currently diagnosed in males as compared to females in a 4:1 ratio (4 men with an ASD for every woman). There are some discussions surrounding diagnosis that suggest that it's actually closer to 2:1 and the reasoning that females are underdiagnosed is that they exhibit different traits to their male peers. It's the expression of these traits that I see as being particularly significant.

For males with Asperger Syndrome or a high functioning ASD, some of the typical traits exhibited are attention to detail, extreme concentration, being able to easily spot anomalies, thinking of things in systematic and logical ways (systemising), and having an intense focus and interest regarding topics that interest them. A lot of these traits are seen as highly desirable in certain fields such as accounting, finance, science, and technology.

As these traits are seen as being highly desirable, a lot of industry specific initiatives have sprung up looking to actively recruit people with Asperger Syndrome or with an ASD.

Microsoft has [one such program](https://www.fastcompany.com/3062835/microsoft-autism-hiring).

> Mary Ellen Smith, corporate vice president of worldwide operations, and Jenny Lay-Flurrie, now Microsoft's chief accessibility officer, believed that hiring more autistic employees would be well aligned with Microsoft's broader goals. They'd also seen firsthand, through their children, that many autistic people are not only perfectly capable of meeting serious intellectual demands — they also can have qualities that are suited for tech jobs, such as being detail-oriented and methodical. Perhaps by adjusting the hiring process, Lay-Flurrie thought, Microsoft could discover great candidates other companies were overlooking.

> Interest in what's called neurodiversity is growing at American companies. This year, the accounting firm EY (formerly known as Ernst & Young) has been piloting a program to employ people with autism in order to explore the benefits of having workers of different cognitive abilities, such as greater productivity and building a more talented workforce.
>
> According to a recent study by Drexel University, 58 percent of young adults with autism are unemployed. And yet, many of them have skills that businesses are looking for. ""This program leverages the skills that people with high functioning autism often have: looking at data, dealing with mathematical concepts, attention to detail, the ability to focus over long periods of time, and looking at large bodies of information and spotting anomalies,"" explains Lori Golden, EY Abilities Strategy Leader who led the pilot program. Right now, EY's program has four employees who work as accounting-support associates.

Thinking of this in terms of The Google Memo, there is minimal overlap between the genders with regards to certain traits or potential ability *on average*, but those on the Autism Spectrum aren't average but rather outliers. Is it disableist to focus on recruiting people with ASD opposed to those who are more neurotypical? Is it sexism to focus on recruiting people with ASD as there are 4 times more men than women having an ASD diagnosis? Is it biological essentialism to claim that the increased likelihood of exhibiting certain desirable traits by those with an ASD is a result of genetics (according to current research)? Is neurodiversity a better measure of diversity than gender or race (no real differences vs. someone's brain being wired completely differently)? Is Google hypocritical for firing James Damore for writing the memo about differences (that may be *in some part* be biological) while at the same time actively recruiting on other differences (that to the best of current understanding *are most probably* biological)?

**Note:** I am *not* making any moral judgements, ""different"" is not ""better"" or ""worse"", it's just ""different"" (and my definition of diversity is the celebration, inclusion, and acceptance of differences in order to make the world a better place).",alterumnonlaedere,t2_bx1u6l,0.78,15,14

>In Naomi Alderman’s new speculative novel The Power, there’s a very literal, tangible power at work. Teen girls have mysteriously developed the ability to wield electricity with their fingers, and any older woman, once jolted by a young girl, can activate this power as well. Women, as a sex, have grown unimaginably dangerous. In every corner of the globe ― the U.S., India, Moldova, England, Nigeria ― women have found themselves with a physical strength that allows them to overpower men, even men who have long abused or controlled them.

>From the outset, readers know how Alderman’s story ends. The Power is framed by correspondence between a supplicating male author, Neil, and a female author, Naomi, to whom he’s writing for thoughts on his historical novel manuscript, which constitutes the rest of the book. The letters in themselves are fascinating, revealing, as they quickly do, that the sexual power dynamics have been neatly flipped in this imagined future: Neil is ingratiating, flattering, apologetic over taking up Naomi’s time. His letter is postmarked from “The Men Writers Association” and signed “Much love.” Her response is flip and patronizing, deeming him a “saucy boy” for putting male soldiers and police officers into his book. “I think I’d rather enjoy this ‘world run by men’ you’ve been talking about,” she concludes. “Surely a kinder, more caring and ― dare I say it? ― more sexy world than the one we live in.”

>This letter from Naomi efficiently reveals one of Alderman’s dominant themes: A world run by women would be no kinder, more caring, or sexier than our current model. The titular power refers not only to the electrical force wielded by women in the novel, but the qualities of power itself ― how possessing power shapes us, allows us to become cruel and careless. Women, she posits, would not be too angelic to turn to violence and exploitation, if we could. If we had the power to get away with it.

>Our terror of female power, and any unsettling of the patriarchal status quo, has been acutely visible in the current #MeToo moment. If women, instead of men, are the adjudicators of truth, then won’t men be injured? We fear overcorrection, men ousted from the industries they love based on unfair or misleading accusations, an abandonment of due process. Some, like Masha Gessen, have warned of a “sex panic.” More disturbingly, innumerable men have hinted that the current wave of sexual harassment accusations and attendant firings is akin to a witch hunt, rather than a form of long-delayed justice. 

>Others, like Erin Gloria Ryan and Rebecca Traister, have cautioned women to be prepared for an inevitable backlash as male power reasserts itself. “You can feel the backlash brewing,” Traister wrote in The Cut recently. “All it will take is one particularly lame allegation — and given the increasing depravity of the charges, the milder stuff looks lamer and lamer, no matter how awful the experience — to turn the tide from deep umbrage on behalf of women to pity for the poor, bullied men.”

>Not only that, she noted, but the natural inclination of men in the workplace would be to limit women’s rights and opportunities in order to protect themselves from accusations. “Many men will absorb the lessons of late 2017 to be not about the threat they’ve posed to women but about the threat that women pose to them,” she wrote. “So there will be more — perhaps unconscious — hesitancy about hiring women, less eagerness to invite them to lunch, or send them on work trips with men.” The reaction to women gaining power will be to push them back down, even if unintentionally.

>“There are strange movements arising now,” Alderman writes, just a year or so into the narrative. “Boys dressing as girls to seem more powerful. Girls dressing as boys to shake off the meaning of the power, or to leap on the unsuspecting, wolf in sheep’s clothing.” By the time a handful of years have passed, a new culture has sprung up: Advertisements that depict strong, commanding girls flaunting their sparks, to the admiration of boys; sprawling networks of female mercenary soldiers; a woman politician openly leering at handsome young journalists and aides; a woman stealing and taking credit for the reporting of her male colleague.

>Perhaps the most terrifying thing about dystopia is how perilously close it can come to utopia. We long to reimagine our world into something more just, more safe, more free, but the cost can’t be ignored: new injustices, new cruelties, new restrictions on human freedom and feeling. Justice, safety and freedom are not distributed equally; a realignment might look utopian to some, dystopian to others. (Extreme proponents of Christian theocracy might look on the Republic of Gilead, the setting of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, far more charitably than feminists.) How do we solve the flaws in our societies without creating newer, greater flaws? What counts as an improvement, and to whom?

>As I read The Power, I found myself ambivalent as to whether the novel qualified as a dystopia or a utopia. It’s casually, and understandably, described as a dystopia in The Washington Post, Harper’s Bazaar, The Guardian and other publications. But why, exactly? Is it dystopian to imagine our own patriarchal society in mirror image? A toxic matriarchy can’t really be any worse than what we have now. Yet, by the same token, surely it’s not better. Which is to say, it’s not better on the whole; it would probably be better for women.

>As in The Power, a display of female power, like that of the #MeToo movement, invites a crackdown; the crackdown, in turn, reveals that this whole time we didn’t have equality, but a begrudging tolerance based on our willingness to cede men the ultimate say. If we insist, at long last, that men not be allowed to sexually terrorize women in the workplace, we are a threat, and threats are to be crushed.

>In Alderman’s book, the threat is not so easy to crush. Intoxicated by their new strength, women torture and kill men who raped or abused them. Men and boys become viscerally fearful of the women and girls in their lives, in the same inescapable, unceasing way women now fear men. 

>The endgame of feminism isn’t to replace the patriarchy with a matriarchy; another system of injustice isn’t the goal. But Alderman’s novel lays bare how difficult ― nearly impossible ― a just and equitable society is to conceive. A reversal of power might leave the other team in charge, but we’re dreaming if we think that women are immune to abusing their power. Either way, the reality remains: One gender has the power, and as long as they have the power, any “equality” is offered as appeasement and can be revoked if we “botch” our plea for justice. 

>Of course, women do have some power, and that’s why we need to be placated, convinced not to think about more extreme measures of retribution. We have voting rights, and we outnumber men. We have purchasing power. We have the weapons to strike at the patriarchal system, to boycott Weinstein Company movies and the “Today” show or to vote wave after wave of women into office. We can make things very uncomfortable for men, if they don’t give us some taste of justice, some hint of equity.

>But we’re not in charge. 

>“Remember, sweetheart,” Allie’s voice tells her again and again, “the only way you’re safe is if you own the place.”

> A woman has lodged a legal appeal with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) after French courts ruled that she had “violated” her “marital duties” by not having sex with her husband.  
> Its main grounds for this was the fact of her not having sex, as reported by her husband, which the court said constituted “a serious and repeated violation of the obligations of marriage, making the maintenance of a shared life intolerable” for him.  
> The two associations representing the woman are la Fondation des femmes and le Collectif féministe contre le viol.   
> In a joint statement, they said the “archaic” ruling “denied women the right to consent or not to sexual relations” in marriage.  

Opinions? Personally I feel the outrage is a little misdirected: They are phrasing it like the court is forcing the woman to have sex with her husband, like some kind of legalized rape. As I understand it they are just giving him grounds for divorce, saying that if she is not sleeping with him he is not forced to  stay married to her. 

I think it's fair to ask whether he's a piece of shit for abandoning his wife due to health issues but I still believe it has to be possible to get out of a relationship if it affects your wellbeing even if it is shitty for the other party.

This is why I believe in no-fault divorce being the only option, simply getting out of a ""contract"" by going to some city office, signing some papers, informing the othe party, waiting a certain period and then being divorced. Less  drama involved and simply more in line with the role of marriage these days.

921,3ac7w8,2015-06-18,FeMRADebates,"An alternative proposal to regular hiring quotas, to avoid discrimination/preference in either direction","*Note: I talk in terms of male-dominated jobs here, but most of this could apply for female-dominated jobs too where we're worried about discrimination against men.*

**Background**: Many jobs, especially in technology and business, have a lot more men than women in them. Many people argue that discrimination against women is common in these positions, so that a woman who applies has a harder time than a man who applies.

The very best way to address this concern would be to have a gender-blind application process, but that's not practical in a lot of cases (one reason is that interviews can't be done gender-blind). One common proposal to avoid discrimination against women that is easier to implement is to enact gender-based quotas to ensure that 50% of the new hires are women. Women are 50% of the population, so they should be 50% of the people hired in a position, right?

**Proposal**: The idea I'm suggesting is a quota where the gender ratio among the people hired is the same as the gender ratio among the people who *applied*. If 50% of the applications for programming positions at a company come from women, 50% of the positions should go to women. If 20% of the applications come from women, 20% of the positions (*not 50%*) should go to women.

If we want the hiring process to be gender-neutral, we compare the percentage of women hired to the percentage of women who applied—*not* to the percentage of women in the general population. The output from the hiring process needs to be compared to the *input* to the hiring process.

**This is intended as a compromise (between full gender quotas and just doing nothing)**. If we just do nothing then a woman applying to a male-dominated job could able to say ""I have reason to worry that if I apply, I will have a harder time getting the job on account of my gender"". However if we implement full 50% quotas then a man applying to a job *could be able to say the exact same thing*. This proposal is based on the idea that neither men nor women should have to worry about their gender harming their chances at getting a job.

**One potential concern that I don't think is a real problem**: Some people in favour of full quotas might note that the fact that fewer women apply could itself be a result of discrimination. My response: This proposal fixes discrimination at the level of hiring. *If* there's discrimination or something pushing women away from these positions earlier in the process (e.g. when they're developing their interests, or when they're deciding what to take in university), then that's a separate problem that needs to be fixed at that stage. If you want women to be 50% of the people hired, make it so that women are 50% of the people applying and then that will happen. My proposal allows a woman who makes it past the earlier stages to know that she won't face discrimination at this stage.

**Two potential concerns that are fair**: First, this doesn't work if you only consider one position (because even if 50% women and 50% men apply, one gender will get 100% of the one position). You have to apply it to a larger number of positions (e.g. all comparable entry-level programming hires a company makes in a certain time-frame). That is also the case for full quotas, though.

Second, the idea makes less sense if we're dealing with a position that one gender as an inherent advantage for. Men are naturally physically stronger; if we have a physically demanding job and 50% of the applicants are women, does it make sense to give them 50% of the spots even if that means men who are more qualified (due to their natural strength advantage) miss out on spots? Probably not. That's an issue to deal with.

However, while this idea isn't perfect, I think the people who want full quotas will see it as a lot better than doing nothing, and I think the people who want to do nothing will see it as a lot better than full quotas.

**I'm interested in options, both from feminists, MRAs, and anyone else.** This is just an idea I had today; I don't know if it's been implemented or if I've thought of all the pros and cons. Also, I'm not suggesting that a law force companies to follow this.",dakru,t2_6hwor,0.86,10,55

Wondered what you fine folks think about our points.","A few weeks ago a friend and I were texting back and forth during the RNC and he made a snide comment(just some banter) about how much I hate women, or something (just looked at the texts. We were discussing partying with the BLM and feminists at the DNC vs the lame white people at the RNC) I responded in kind and we decided to have an informal debate on the validity of feminism in the modern 1st world.  He sent the text that is presented below:

>First and foremost, the gender pay gap not only exists, but it's significant. The 79% figure only doesn't exist if you dismiss all instances of systematic gender discrimination in the hiring process and the promotion process. Many, many women are encouraged from birth to pursue certain careers within the workforce and to be subservient, lest they be called a ""fucking bitch"" or something along those lines.

>We've actually gone over this numerous times, you and I. You seem to think societal influence and antiquated upbringing doesn't matter and it's on the women to just ""overcome"" that. But I think it's far, far more complicated than that. Whereas men (such as yourself) are taught from a young age to be dominant and to go out and take what you want, women are (often) not. So it's incredibly easy for you to sit there and say that women need to learn to negotiate their job promotions better. You do not deal with the judgment and scrutiny that women deal with from their coworkers on a daily basis. And before you go off the deep end, I didn't say you didn't deal with any scrutiny at all. In fact the very idea that women should be subservient and men should be dominant CAUSES you to undergo all kinds of scrutiny. If you're not aggressive enough in your line of work for example, you may be more scrutinized than a woman would be for being meek. The way society works right now can be just as disadvantageous for men as it can be for women, just not in the ways they might expect it. Which brings me to my next point...

>Currently our society puts men in jail FAR more than it puts women in jail. Women are looked upon as demure and held less accountable for their actions in court. Thereby causing law enforcement, juries, and judges to not only give preferential treatment to women in the court, but ALSO to be harder on men. 

>The fact that men go to jail more than women only reinforces that gender roles in regards to accountability are alive and well. Same goes for domestic abuse cases. ""The woman is helpless and the man oughta know better.""  Maybe the woman isn't helpless. Maybe the man did it to defend HIMSELF. The idea that the man always did the hitting is because women are looked upon as a non-threat. That's sexism. 

>And don't even get me STARTED on cases of getting custody of children. Of course women win custody all the time. People associate women with being maternal and men with being uninterested in child-rearing. That's a terrible thing that happens and all goes back to perceived gender roles within the legal system. Yes, men do get fucked over in both the criminal and the civil legal system. And it's BEACAUSE of the way women are perceived as incompetent and as caregivers for children, respectively.  It's the best proof for a patriarchal society that exists. And it's pretty goddamn solid. And yet MRAs are CONSTANTLY citing it as a reason women are dominant in society. It makes zero fucking sense.

>If you look at underlying causes rather than just the surface of reality of ""Men go to jail more. So women must have an advantage in society"" then it becomes very clear we have a serious problem in this country in regards to sexism. Women have their roles, and men have theirs. It's fucking gross.

>I could write all day about this bro. But I'll stop there for now. I have more examples, and more things to say, and I'll be glad to go over them, but I'm sure you have a lot of picking apart to do, so have at it.

Yes, that was in one text message.  In the interest of readability (and being able to reference his text as I typed. Phone screens are small, damnit) I responded with an email, hoping that we could continue in that format:

>Okay, let's get right to it.  Here's my problem with your argument, and 3rd wave feminism as a monolith (let's not dick around with semantics and ""no true feminist"" fallacies.  I'm talking mainstream modern feminist theory and actions.  When legislation gets involved, you don't get to start with the ""there is no one true feminism"" talk):  

>Your argument concludes from page one that women have no agency.  You know that the naked numbers of the wage gap don't work so it becomes ""systemic sexism keeps women from negotiating wages."" Or ""gender roles drive women into specific careers"" without even considering that the women in those careers might be able to make those decisions for themselves.  Implying that a woman who had the drive, ambition, and ruthless aggression that is necessary to succeed in the upper echelons of business or politics would be driven away in tears because she was called a ""fucking bitch"".  That's rediculous and, frankly, insulting.  But that's only the top echelons, right?  What about all those working class women that are trailing so far behind in wages?  Once again, choice is the main factor.  From the Department Of Labor:  “Women, more than men, show a demonstrated preference for lower risk occupations with greater workplace safety and comfort, and they are frequently willing to accept lower wages for the greater safety and reduced probability of work-related injury or death...""

>So let's talk prison, eh?  You are correct in your point that men are incarcerated at much higher rates than women for similar or equal crimes.  Wether that is the result of ""benevolent sexism"" or the idea that women are often the primary caregivers of children is a malleable point.  Sometimes it's A, sometimes B.  But that brings me to another sticking point against feminism;  where are the feminists talking about this gender gap?  Sure, you'll find a few on Reddit or Jezebel paying lip service to the issue. But beyond that?  Where's the proposed legislations?  When's ""equal sentencing day""?  Oh, we're doing ""manspreading"" right now?  Yeah, that seems like a more important topic.

>But what about domestic violence?  It's those darn gender roles again, right?  Men are stronger and more violent and clearly more likely to abuse their intimate partners.  Let's ignore the data that shows that women are just as likely, if not more likely, to be the perpetrators of abuse.  No, let's talk about why law enforcement policies are geared towards male abusers.  Feminist organizations like DAIP continue to push their rediculous Duluth model that asserts that only men can be abusive.  Feminist organizations that banded together to help push through the Violence Against Women Act which, while well intentioned, also assumes that men are only perpetrators not victims.  This legislation is written with the express purpose of benefiting women, at the cost of men.  There are next to no abuse shelters that accept men.  When someone tries to start an abused men's shelter?  Feminists shut it down.  This is the biggest case against 3rd make feminism.  They expressly do not want equality.  Feminism has no place in the western world.  When you can influence political change in a very real way.  When a woman can ruin a man's life, reputation, career with a series of phone calls?  You can not call yourself oppressed.  No one is oppressed!  THATS A GOOD THING!  Now can we talk about some of the oversights that resulted from women's rise to equality?

Some of you have probably already heard the story of [the ""Self Made Man""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip7kP_dd6LU), where a woman posed as a man for 18 months, then discussed the differences of her experiences as a male and as a female

The article above is a similar thing, except with actual transmen. The conclusion these particular men came to was basically that they were taken more seriously in the workplace, e.g.
>As soon as he began hosting as a man, he stopped getting as many calls from men pointing out tiny errors. ""It was always male callers to Sheila saying I had screwed up my grammar, correcting me,"" he says. ""I don’t get as many calls to James correcting me.""

>Since his transition, he’s noticed that his female patients are less open with him about their sexual behavior, but his bosses give him more responsibility

And also that they were treated as being threats automatically, e.g.
>""I have to be very careful to not be staring at kids,"" says Gardner. ""I can look at a mom and her baby, but I can’t look for too long. I miss being seen as not a threat."" Ditto for kids on the playground and puppies, multiple guys said.

>As a trans man of color, Milan says he feels that the world perceives him as a menace, and his interactions with police officers have gotten much more fraught. ""I've had people make assumptions that I was dangerous or I was a criminal. I’ve been followed around stores. I've seen white women who look physically scared, visibly shaken if there's just the two of us in a elevator,"" he says. ""You can’t even ask a cop for directions as a black man.""

Which I think is to be expected, and in fact that both issues are related: women seem to be infantilized by society. For this reason, they're not always taken as seriously as men is the workplace, but at the same time they're not seen as threatening. Basically, they're seen as less capable of doing great good like being highly successful, or of doing horrible evils like raping or attacking people

There are a couple of critiques that I have
>""If I start to get too close, I can feel her fear, I can feel that she's getting upset,"" says Milan. ""And it’s really just an indication of how dangerous this world is for women.""

That could be more an indication of how much people and especially women are taught to fear men. He's making it into an issue of sexism against women, but I think it can be argued either way:

After all, if a White person felt afraid around a Black person because he was Black, would people say ""that's an indication of how dangerous things are for White people"" or would they say ""that's an indication of how prejudice Whites are against Blacks, always assuming they're criminals""? 

It seems a similar thing here: women fearing that any given man is a predator could be more an indication of prejudice assumptions about men than the actual likelihood that any given man is a predator

The transmen also mentioned things like how men talk about women to other men
>I’ve heard men say things about slapping a woman or cheating on women in the most brutal ways and think it’s okay

But I don't believe this is a man thing as much as how men and women talk about the opposite gender when around people of the same gender. It's not as if women don't also slap men or cheat on men and think it's perfectly okay.

You're turning the (often quite brutal) killings of other human beings into entertainment content that you consume the same way you would consume ""The Office"". It's disrespectful of the victim, and in my opinion, it indicates a disturbed psyche, that you would find that entertaining.

Now, let's compare that to men who have unusual interests - stuff like anime or other things that the mainstream sees as nerdy and uncool. Personally, I'm not into anime or nerdy things (although I have nothing against those who are), but come on. Anime is a creative work that doesn't harm any real people. You're not turning someone else's tragedy into your entertainment.

A teenage boy or adult man who is into anime is way more likely to be socially ostracized/judged for it than a teenage girl or adult woman who is into true crime, even though true crime is creepy, exploitative, insensitive, and messed up, whereas anime is just not really a mainstream thing to be into in the US (where I live).",GonnaRainDown,t2_h3d500ju,0.76,10,19

>In honor of International Women’s Day yesterday, I want to explore why gender issues make it harder for both men and women to be candid at work, and to suggest some ideas for addressing the problem. Here’s the short version:

>Gender politics and fear of tears push men away from being as radically candid with women as they are with other men. This is bad for men, women and the truth. Gender bias pushes women away from being radically candid in a way that is also bad for men, women and the truth.

>The difficulty of being candid is NOT a gender issue. Everyone has a hard time with it. Last November, I gave a talk at The First Round CEO Summit describing Radical Candor, which is the ability to give feedback in a way that challenges people directly, and at the same time shows you care about them personally.

>Radical Candor is rare because criticizing employees can feel brutal, and praising them can feel patronizing. But praise and criticism are, as Ben Horowitz, the venture capitalist, once put it in his blog on management, “The unnatural atomic building block atop which the unnatural skill set of management gets built.” Giving praise and criticism is just the beginning. Great bosses must also get it — especially criticism — from employees, and encourage it between them too.

>While analyzing why praise and criticism are such “unnatural acts” for most people, I found there are two especially common reasons:

>Most people have been taught since they learned to talk some version of “If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say it at all.” When they become bosses, the very thing they've been taught not to do since they were 18-months-old is suddenly their job.


>Most people, since they got their first job around age 18 — at a time when their egos are fragile but their personas are just starting to gel — have been exhorted to be “professional.” Too often, that’s code for not “getting personal” with anyone at work. But to give praise and criticism effectively, you have to care personally. You have to give a damn about the person you’re talking to. It's your job to care.

>That’s why being radically candid is hard. One of the best ways to make it easier is to remind people what happens when they fail to care personally and challenge directly.

>Obnoxious Aggression is what happens when you challenge, but don’t care. Ruinous Empathy is what happens when you care, but don’t challenge — and 80% of management mistakes happen as a result of Ruinous Empathy, in my experience. Finally, worst but also fortunately comparatively rare, is Manipulative Insincerity — when you neither care nor challenge.

>I was recently talking to a physics professor whose student didn’t know the quadratic equation. (I don’t remember it from high school algebra either, but I’m not majoring in physics.) Stunned, and wondering how she’d gotten this far with such a gaping hole in her knowledge, the professor told her she needed to learn it immediately. Furious at the criticism, she slammed him in his rating as a teacher.

>This didn’t start out as a gender issue but it became one. The initial problem was that this young person, like so many others, was unused to criticism — a phenomenon explored well in an Atlantic article I like, The Coddling of the American Mind. But the professor's colleagues, many of them well-meaning men trying to be sensitive to gender issues, somehow made the rift into one. Suddenly, telling a student majoring in physics that she needed to learn the quadratic equation became a risky thing for professors at this institution to do.

>This situation was bad for the student who didn’t learn what she needed to know to succeed. And it was bad for all the female students this professor taught after her. Understandably, he became more hesitant to criticize the work of his female students than his male students. But to grow in their field, these young women, like their male counterparts, needed his criticism. The situation wasn’t much fun for the professor either. Real teaching — the reason why he’d chosen his profession — became risky.

>Recently, I was talking to a close male friend who’s an engineering leader about the issue of women in tech. I suggested he ask a woman who works for him — a person whose career he's supported and nurtured for years — what she thought. He looked up at me with real surprise. “I can’t talk to her about that! It’s too fraught,” he said.

>This came from a man who's not just unbiased but truly sensitive to bias and determined to stamp it out. He catches things even I miss. So if he can’t have a radically candid conversation about gender issues with a woman he knows well, we’ve hit a real low. But the problem is not him, nor the woman who works for him. I know them both, and I'm pretty sure that the conversation would’ve gone well. It's that the swirl around gender issues has everybody walking on eggshells.

>Another male colleague recently got caught in a firestorm by making an important and logical point about gender in the workplace. Phrases he used got taken out of context and blown up in the press and throughout social media. This is another man who’s committed to treating everyone he works with fairly, and regularly throws extra energy into fostering the careers of his female colleagues. But after this kerfluffle, he decided he wasn’t going to talk about gender publicly any more. I couldn’t blame him. But it was another blow to Radical Candor and to civil discourse on an important topic where he was, for my money, on the right side.

>One common bias women fall prey to and perpetrate: 'The Abrasive Trap.'

>Here’s my personal experience with the Abrasive Trap. One day, my boss called me into his office and asked me if I was familiar with recent competence / likeability literature. I wasn’t, and he explained point blank that the more competent a woman is, the less her colleagues tend to like her. There were a couple of people I worked with who simply found me unlikeable, and it was making my boss’s life harder. He asked: could I work on my “likeability”?

>It was painful to hear that my colleagues didn’t like me, and I didn’t really agree with my boss’s approach. I thought he should address the gender bias, not tell me to work around it by making nice with people who resented my competence. But I loved the work I was doing. I was close friends with the men sitting in the offices to the right and left of me. And, in my heart, I knew I could in fact be obnoxiously aggressive sometimes.

>I was pretty sure I’d fixed the problem when my boss called me into his office once more. He said things were better, but he had an idea that would totally put the issue to rest. I was all ears. His suggestion? A demotion for me. That way, he explained, my colleagues would not be so jealous of my position. That would would make it easier for me to be more “likeable.” Less than three weeks later, I found another, better job and quit.

>A while ago Kieran Snyder, a linguist and co-founder of Textio, applied linguistic analysis to performance reviews, and she found that when women challenge men or women directly — which they must do to be successful — they get penalized for being “abrasive.” (That word actually comes up verbatim a lot.) To be sure, the abrasive label gets placed on women by other women as well as by men.

>Researchers ran a simulation of what happens to promotions over the course of several years when bias impacts ratings just a little bit. When gender bias accounts for just 5% of the difference in performance ratings, an organization that starts out with 58% of the entry level positions filled by women winds up with only 29% of the leadership positions filled by women.

>Of course, that’s only part of the story. Let’s look at what happens to Jessica personally over the course of her career, not just the leadership composition of her company. If she’s early in her career, she’ll probably get promoted eventually despite her alleged “abrasiveness,” but now she’s a year or so “behind” Steve. Fast forward another 5 to 7 years. Now Steve is two levels ahead of Jessica. Since pay increases steeply with each promotion, he may be getting paid a lot more than Jessica is paid. If Steve and Jessica are married, and they have a child, guess whose career is more important for family income, and who’s more likely to stay home from work when the baby is sick?

>But that’s not even the worst-case scenario for Jessica. Let’s imagine that she takes the “abrasive” feedback to heart and quits challenging her reports directly. She adjusts her behavior so that she's less effective at work. Instead of being “radically candid,” her feedback is always “ruinously empathetic” or “manipulatively insincere.” This makes her less effective as a leader. So now, in addition to gender bias, there are real performance issues to contend with. In this case, Jessica is never going to get ahead. Frustrated beyond measure and feeling that she must choose between being liked and being successful, she decides that this is not a game worth playing — and quits.

>Some version of this has happened to literally every professional woman I know. We must stop this madness, too.

>These issues have gotten too hot to handle. Men — even the men who genuinely care about addressing gender bias — have understandably decided it’s not worth the risk to talk about anything remotely related to gender. The risk doesn’t come from the women they work with. It sometimes comes from other men who stir the pot in an effort to use gender issues to advance their careers. It sometimes comes from an overzealous HR department. It sometimes comes from the law, which can so often be an ass. It sometimes comes from the swirl of social media, or a one-sided story in the press — these stories are too often low-hanging fruit for reporters looking for something brainless and juicy. Context matters, and the context of gender politics and gender bias has become untouchable, to everyone's detriment.

929,mmfpvq,2021-04-08,FeMRADebates,"The Stereotype Content Model: Warmth, Competence, and Bigotry","One of the reasons I tag myself as ""Other"" is because I tend to side with ""Social/Cognitive/Neuropsychology"" rather than Feminist or MRA doctrine.  To that end, I'd like to introduce a model I came across recently.  (Not sure why this wasn't introduced in my Social Psych course.  I will admit it's entirely possible I skipped that day. :P)

# An Intro

For those unfamiliar, the [Stereotype Competence Model](https://cos.gatech.edu/facultyres/Diversity_Studies/Fiske_StereotypeContent.pdf) comes from Social Psychology.  It states that the way we stereotype and respond to ""out groups"" depends on how we perceive the members of that group.  In general, our perception of a group's *warmth* depends on whether they compete with our group (more competition = less warmth) and our perception of a group's competence depends on whether the group is considered high status (high status = high competence, low status = low competence).

The creators of the model have coined four different terms to describe how we react to people within these out groups:

||Low Competence|High Competence|
|:-|:-|:-|
|High Warmth|*Paternalistic Prejudice* (pity, sympathy) - e.g. the elderly, disabled people|*Admiration* (pride, admiration)|
|Low Warmth|*Contemptuous Prejudice* (contempt, disgust, anger, resentment) - e.g. welfare recipients, the homeless|*Envious Prejudice* (envy, jealousy) - e.g. the rich, Asian people|

Where groups are placed does depend on who is polled.  That first link was primarily poling white American women, but a [cross-cultural study](https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3912751/figure/F4/) in Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea had groups like ""Mainland Chinese"" placed in Low Competence/Low Warmth (by Hong Kongers) while [an examination](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3882081/) of historical publications from fascist Italy categorized groups like ""Jews"", ""the English"" and ""democratic collaborators"" as Low-Warmth/High-Competence.  It also depends on how specific a sub-group you're getting (in the first study of the first link, ""poor whites"" and ""poor blacks"" were both assigned to Low-Warmth/Low-Competence while professional whites & blacks were assigned to ""Low-Warmth/High-Competence"".  This [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10869-020-09713-4) from Sweden looks specifically at the intersection of gender, sexuality, age, and the effects of being white/Arab, showing, for example, that although on average Arab women only receive a 3/5 rating for competence, being homosexual ups that to 3.44/5 while being older (55) lowers it to 2.74/5.

So where am I going with all this?  In general, men are rated High-Competence/Low-Warmth but that changes if the man is gay (Medium-Warmth/Medium-Competence).  Women are assigned to High-Competence/High-warmth *but* that changes once you know if the woman works or not (housewives are assigned to High-Warmth/Low-Competence while professional women are assigned to Low-Warmth/High-Competence).  For a more in-depth look at the interaction with gender, there's a whole book chapter available for download [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320149179_Warmth_and_competence_A_feminist_look_at_power_and_negotiation).

# So What Does That Mean for Men & Women?

Well, first off, it suggests that team ""everyone experiences prejudice"" is correct.  

If you're a straight man, you likely experience *envious prejudice,* especially if you're a straight business professional rather than a gay man or blue collar worker.  People perceive this group as both high status and a serious threat in the competition for resources, and are consequently likely to perceive men as highly competent but lacking in warmth.

If you're a woman, your group as a whole is considered admirable (High-Warmth/High-Competency), which many folks here will recognize as in keeping with the ""women are wonderful"" effect, but you as an individual will never be actually be classed as this hypothetical woman.  If you fill a traditionally feminine role like ""housewife"", you will experience *paternalistic prejudice.* People perceive this group as non-threatening and therefore you are something to take care of on par with elderly and disabled people.  If you fill a non-traditional role like business person, lesbian, or feminist, you will experience the same *envious prejudice* as men do.

So if straight men, lesbians, the rich, Asians, business women, Jews, black professionals, and feminists all experience the same kind of prejudice, does that mean they all have it equally ""badly""?  Conversely, are all of these groups just over-reacting?

Almost certainly not.  I'm going to break Godwin's law and point out that the discrimination that Jews faced in fascist Italy is indisputably worse than the discrimination that modern rich people face in America.  The point is not that all of these groups are exactly the same, but that the way people feel about (and consequently stereotype) these groups bear surprising similarities, and that can hopefully be a starting point for empathy/understanding between groups, and perhaps a bit of reality check for people who believe that it's harmless to express prejudice as long as you're ""punching up"".

I'm also hoping to suggest out that when we talk about ""intersectionality"", we shouldn't be thinking of overlapping identities as part of a privilege/prejudice check list but more of an acknowledgement that your identity might cause you to experience different kinds of prejudice when interacting with different members of outgroups, and that being a member of a group that is generally seen as ""high status"" or ""high competence"" doesn't mean you can't be a victim of prejudice if the person who has power over you sees you as ""other"" instead of ""us"".

# What About Gynocentrism/Male Disposability?

I think this model offers a slightly different interpretation of what MRAs are observing.  The vast majority of men are *not* seen as disposable (though those that are also members of ""Low-Warmth/Low-Competence groups might be, so MRA activism for those specific groups of men *is* important).  Instead, most men are simply seen as competent but not warm (or moderately competent and moderately warm).  Many women (including feminists) also find themselves in these categories, so when MRAs claim that men are the victims of a unique and systemic form of prejudice, feminists are actually right to be sceptical, because they face the same brand of prejudice - *envious prejudice* \- and being a woman does not protect them from it.

At the same time, women who are content to be housewives genuinely are seen as higher status/worthy of protection, which seems to be in keeping with gynocentrism, but on closer inspection reveals some pretty obvious short comings.  This protection is only offered to women so long as they remain ""unthreatening"" and ""incompetent"".  We probably wouldn't say that our society gives preferential treatment towards the other groups that fall within this category (elderly people, those with physical or mental disabilities), so it makes little sense to talk about this as ""privilege"" for one group and ""prejudice"" for the others.

# What About Patriarchy/Misogyny?

Here too, I think that the model is offering a slightly different interpretation of what feminists are observing, though to be fair there are so many different branches of feminism that it's hard to pin down any one set of claims as ""official dogma"".  Concepts like ambivalent sexism and the Madonna-Whore complex do acknowledge that different groups of women often experience prejudice in different ways, but there's a tendency among feminists to consider privilege/prejudice as absolutes when looking at out-groups (e.g. a black man will experience privilege for being a man and prejudice for being black while a white woman experiences prejudice for being a woman but privilege for being white).  This model suggests that this is only true so long as the person who has power over these individuals sees them as part of an in-group.  A man who works under all female leadership probably will experience *envious prejudice* for being a man while a woman who joins the same company will probably experience *admiration* for being part of the leaders' ""in-group"".

This model doesn't really offer much in the way of confirming or denying misogyny, in part because misogyny has several different definitions and in part because it doesn't attempt to look at why people categorize different groups of women this way or the end result for women.  Some feminists have suggested that the idea of ""good women"" vs ""bad women"" has been used to control women in general.  This model certainly does suggest that ""women"" are placed in a different quadrant than individualized women (e.g. ""house wives"" or ""business women"", who both experience prejudice) but does not attempt to describe what the consequences of this are.  It also suggests that *many of the* women who are empowered to speak are not experiencing a unique form of hatred towards women, but instead are experiencing the same brand of prejudice that men (and other ""competent""/""competitive"" groups experience).

# Shortcomings of the Model

While the model does suggest that there is a lot of commonality between the types of prejudice faced by different groups, it can only talk of generalities.  No attempt is made, for example, to account for sex differences and how they might result in different experiences of the same prejudice.  There's also no attempt to account for cultural differences and how the normalization of specific forms of prejudice might account for different experiences of the same prejudice (e.g. being considered a fair target for mockery in the media vs a fair target for physical assault).  It is very much a ""theory of how prejudice works"" rather than a specific description of individual prejudices.

# Questions to Discuss

1. If you're an MRA or a Feminist, what's your take on how your beliefs accord with this model?  Is my take a fair interpretation of your beliefs?
2. Do you think it's valid to think in terms of ""different prejudices"" or do we also need to ""check our privilege""?
3. Do ""Paternalistic Prejudice"" and/or ""Envious Prejudice"" seem like valid concerns to you, or should we focus on ""Contemptuous Prejudice""?  Why or why not?",Celestaria,t2_a1amd,0.86,25,12

This isn't to downplay gang warfare or minimise the experiences of the men who fall victim to it or indeed those who are their victims. We often hear that women don't feel safe walking home at night. The phrase ""Violence against women"" is often used.

Universities, high schools, and companies offering internships outright prioritize women wanting to study STEM. Companies in STEM fields outright prioritize hiring women whenever possible and after those women are hired, the companies will make sure to have programs to help them advance their careers.

Andrew Tate doesn't count, he's not popular, and I have no reason to believe he's ever told women not to study STEM.

I think this is a great article about the perspective of the women who almost became CEOs on why they didn't make it to the top.  Hearing the experiences of the people affected by a problem is important in understanding it.  I have some criticisms.

I come from the perspective of someone who's beliefs are feminism-compatible and doesn't deny that women are treated unfairly in some aspects of life like a lot of anti-feminists tend to.

**Intrinsic motivations around sex and success == fulfilled life goals**

> Sally Blount, dean of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern and the only woman to lead a top 10 business school, noted that data predicts that half or more of the women who earn an M.B.A. this year will drop out of the full-time work force within a decade. The reasons range from family conflicts to placing less inherent value on position or money. That accounts in part for the low number of women who do reach the very top job, because fewer remain in the pipeline. Yet even those women who stay and reach the C-suite are more likely than men to be overlooked, Ms. Blount said.

I have discussed the inherent drive for position and money here before.  (https://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/5y0990/feminization_of_jobs/demliuk/)  Women gain nothing but position and money when they obtain position and/or money.  Men have whole new kinds of fulfillment opened up to them at that level; trophy wives, nice cars that trigger their adventure-seeking, waving their big financial dick around, envy, etc.  Women obtain just the position and money.  If women valued trophy pool boys, cars, expensive yachts as much as men do then perhaps they would be more driven to seek money more aggressively.  

These things just come down to sex.  More money = more and better sex for men, whereas more money != more and better sex for women.  

**Socialisation of women vs men** 

> What they say: Women are often seen as dependable, less often as visionary. Women tend to be less comfortable with self-promotion — and more likely to be criticized when they do grab the spotlight. Men remain threatened by assertive women. **Most women are not socialized to be unapologetically competitive.** Some women get discouraged and drop out along the way. And many are disproportionately penalized for stumbles.

(emphasis mine)

I think this socialisation problem along with intrinsic motivators are the biggest problems that are keeping women down.

I agree that women are unfairly penalized for being assertive.  I have heard of studies in this area and believe it is probably a real problem.  They need to do work to overcome the socialization to be passive while the men are playing golf together.

What are your thoughts?  

**Brutality, as shitty as it is**

> “For years I thought it was a pipeline question,” said Julie Daum, who has led efforts to recruit women for corporate boards at Spencer Stuart. “But it’s not — I’ve been watching the pipeline for 25 years. There is real bias, and without the ability to shine a light on it and really measure it, I don’t think anything’s going to change. Ultimately at the top of an organization there are fewer and fewer spots, and if you can eliminate an entire class of people, it makes it easier.”

> She drew an unwelcome conclusion. “Women are prey,” she said. “They can smell it in the water, that women are not going to play the same game. Those men think, ‘If I kick her, she’s not going to kick back, but the men will. So I’ll go after her.’ It’s keeping women in their place. I truly believe that.”

Being on top requires breaking rules and sacrificing everything else in your life for your dream/goal.  The talk around gender parity in C-Suite roles seems to be focused on how to make the ladder more fair, and thus more compatible, for women.  I don't think that is ever going to be possible, because the fair company is going to be eaten by the one controlled by a psychopath.  Does a young lion play fair when it is killing the aging lion of the pride?  

Our world would be a better place if less of the smashy-smashy testosterone drive controlled our world.  The C-Suite is the modern day equivalent to the veldt.  Controlling billions of dollars is the ultimate test of genetic fitness just like being the lion with the largest pride is for that species.

One's whole being must be aligned with fighting all the way to the top.  I've worked at a start-up and the 18 hour days are something that you can only do when you are fully committed, or insane.  

I see this as an engineering problem; if you looked at the amplitude of emotion related to success it would probably be higher in men, if you could see the amount of time that men focus on success in their mind and hearts, it would be higher.  If it takes 1000 points to become a CEO, the person who can push the button faster is going to get there first.  I think my idea about intrinsic motivators is a critical part of this.

Do I think cutthroat corporate ladders are healthy and good for the world?  No; I think that the men who make it to the top are uneven people who focus too much on cutting throats.

**Giving up**

> Her turning point came when she was outmaneuvered by male colleagues during a corporate reorganization. Believing she was not going to rise further, she asked for an exit package.

> Looking back, she is convinced that being a woman hurt her. “I rewrote the entire strategy for the company, doubled its share price,” she said. “We had a little bit of a dip. All of the guys had missed their numbers more. There’s a guy positioning himself as the successor. He hasn’t made his number in seven years. He’s tall and good looking and hangs around the right circles.”

> She drew an unwelcome conclusion. “Women are prey,” she said. “They can smell it in the water, that women are not going to play the same game. Those men think, ‘If I kick her, she’s not going to kick back, but the men will. So I’ll go after her.’ It’s keeping women in their place. I truly believe that.”

Is this article is about giving up?  The person who ends up in the top spot, regardless of whether they deserved it, is probably the last to be outmaneuvered or kicked when they are down.  Men also face shitty treatment, but those men have societal pressure and reward systems to not let someone ""keep them in their place.""  The men who end up at the top are the ones who kept kicking back.  Perhaps women may get there because of higher performance and the men get there because they're fighters who don't back down.  

Perhaps men treat the men around them with more respect because they can form friendships with those men more easily than with women.  Imagine a group of 100 business people, most of the candidates will be pushed and kicked to the curb along the climb.  The men and women may face similar levels of disrespect from their non-friend peers.  The men have a secret weapon, though, they can befriend and bond with the other men and possibly prevent some of the worst shit from getting to them thanks to mutual respect.  

Everyone who talks about the men at the top fails to see all of the men lower on the totem pole who were treated just as poorly as the women in question (not counting any sexual harrassment that men don't have to deal with very often).  They only see the alphas at the top and assume that men don't recieve the same kind of shitty treatment.  Perhaps the ones right at the top look like they don't get shat on, but at that level, male confidence requires taking your punches and not letting it affect you.

**Male comraderie problem and poor optics of socialising with women on the team**

> “You’re the only woman,” she said. “It’s very lonely. I was at a high level playing in a golf foursome with all high-level men. One said, ‘I didn’t know you knew how to play.’ I said, ‘You never asked me.’ I never drank with them. I never tried to be one of the guys. I spent more energy on performance.”

As discussed in the article and elsewhere, women are unfairly penalized for seeking pay raises, promotions and being assertive.  They face backstabbing and being kicked to the wayside on the corporate ladder.

If women face excessive amounts of backstabbing and kicking (this is plausible), perhaps it has something to do with the easy comraderie of men.  The golfing and social drinking outside of the office are important for team building and are easier for men to participate in without the presence of women.  The potential flirtatiousness of socializing with women outside of work is a good example of how good intentions, or not wanting to be assumed to have bad intentions, could be part of the problem.  

**The difficulty of men mentoring women**

> Dina Dublon, who retired in 2004 as chief financial officer of JPMorgan Chase, said male colleagues sometimes told her they were reluctant to have dinner or drinks with female subordinates — important bonding activities in the corporate world — because it might be seen as flirtatious.

A personal example, a woman started at my company a while ago right when we were taking a week to work on personal passion projects in adhoc teams in a kind of simulated start-up incubator.  I was one of the first people she met at the company, so I didn't think anything of asking her to join my team because she was qualified and expressed an interest in my project.

As someone who strongly believes in equality and have beliefs that intersect with feminism, I did some internal checking to make sure I wasn't treating her any differently than I would a man; no mansplaining, not cutting her off or making assumptions, actively deferring to her expertise, in doing so I was treating her differently, but perhaps in a *more fair* way that I should extend to everyone.  

As we work in an open concept office, I was accutely aware of the physical logistics of not wanting to be perceived as ""taking a liking to the new girl.""  I had to treat the physical space around her differently than I would with a man.  I made sure to never enter her personal space even if it would be appropriate or make some aspect of pair-programming easier.  

This is a simple example.  We had a great time and did great work on our project, so I call it a success, but there were parts where I was worrying about the perception of other people.  I'm not ""that guy"" and I never want people to think that.

If after-hours socialisation were a more important part of our jobs, I feel like I would have to put up an even stronger barrier so as to not be assumed to be flirtatious.  Those walls make comraderie much more difficult.",FarAsUCanThrowMe,t2_i4ero,0.75,19,11

941,hwjneo,2020-07-23,FeMRADebates,The AOC/Ted Yoho controversy and how we view insults toward men versus women,"This is something I was thinking about today after seeing AOC's speech in Congress. When I first heard about Yoho's [""fucking bitch"" comments](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/508312-hoyer-calls-on-gop-lawmaker-to-apologize-on-house-floor-for-accosting-ocasio), I thought they were unprofessional and childish. Politically I'm pretty centrist/liberal and not much of a progressive or conservative, but it was clear to me at the time that AOC would come out looking like the bigger person. 

But now, AOC and Pelosi seem to be describing it as an ""attack on women"" and ""abuse""; and AOC is being lauded as a victim of sexism. I find this interesting--in part because I've never seen ""bitch"" as any more sexist than ""asshole,"" ""douchebag,"" or the plethora of other insults that are primarily lobbed at one gender. If anything, ""bitch"" is used toward both men and women, albeit with different meanings and contexts. But most importantly, I am surprised to continue seeing so many women's rights advocates and feminists treat insults directed at men and women very, very differently.

The question of ""why are men and women held to different standards"" has been discussed ad nauseum, both on this sub and elsewhere. But what fascinates me is how differently men and women are treated when they are *targets* of insults or personal attacks. I.e. society at large takes way more offense when someone, especially a man, lobs insults at a woman. Whereas if some random female congressperson called AOC a ""fucking bitch,"" it wouldn't have had as much staying power as a story.

So why do you think that is? Now that more and more women are being elected into office, will the ""male=abuser, woman=target"" mentality disappear with other gender roles? I've always seen the over-protection and dependence of women as a leftover gender role that's existed for centuries, but I'm curious as to other thoughts. Will this mentality be something that erodes over time as gender roles erode? Or will mainstream feminists continue using this gender role to the advantage of women wherever possible, supporting what seems to be a traditionalist and paternalistic difference in treatment between the sexes?",Map42892,t2_3sm0z,0.85,42,85
942,yae2cq,2022-10-22,FeMRADebates,"""Right to sex"" is a problematic term.","""Right to sex"" makes it sound like there is some man somewhere who has a right to some woman somewhere's vagina, regardless of whether or not she wants to have sex with him. The term sounds nasty on its face and generally triggers defensive reactions in men that stop  those men from talking about real solutions to real social issues. 

-

Male sexlessness is a genuine social issue. Anyone telling you otherwise is a woman. It is a social issue caused by other social issues. I'll name a few that need to be solved and I'll give you a spoiler: At no point will I write that there is a woman somewhere with no right to say no to some man.

-

First, Female perspective is privileged over male perspective in all important areas of our culture. No university in America has a department that is not associated with feminism or female-privileging ideologies and will write theory in a renegade way without caring if someone objects ""As a woman, I disagree."" However, every single university has at least a few departments that reference ideologies based around the female perspective.

This gives men and boys two choices. You can either take a mentally submissive role and use someone else's thoughts and experiences as the basis for how you view the world,  or you can be seen as backwards or even hateful towards women. Actually, there is a third option. Some men  choose to be snakes in the grass who praise female perspectives to try and lie their way into bed. 

2. Second Affirmative Action makes a lot of men much less fuckable. Successful men  are more fuckable, but there is a very widespread systematic effort to make it harder and harder for a man to be successful. Furthermore, women are taught that the men around them are privileged and so if they're in the same spot, she outworked him. This lowers the general amount of respect that men  will receive. 

3. Boys are no longer allowed to be boys. This is impossible to explain to women, but boys really do  enjoy things like making noise and hitting each other with sticks. The way boys play is not inherently bullying and preventing this play does not prevent bullying. [Bullying rates have risen sharply.](https://cyberbullying.org/school-bullying-rates-increase-by-35-from-2016-to-2019) Also, nobody  in the history  of the world has ever said ""Boys will be boys"" to justify rape. I have no idea where that strawman comes from. Boys playing is where they learn  to act like men and to act like males. It is critically important for development and the development of masculinity.    

4. Toxic lessons on anti-masculinity. Masculine behaviors are shown over and over again to be attractive to females of all ages. Downstream effects of high testosterone,  such as masculine faces, are seen as more attractive by females as they age into  women. More fertile women in particular are more attracted to more masculine men. If this is the case, then why is masculinity taught in such a way that makes so many men feel as though it's being demonized? Certainly nobody is thinking it's being praised or held up as the ideal to strive for. Boys going through their basic education are learning to be unattractive. 

5. Cancel culture cancels men. One of the best and most attractive thing men can do is have a mind  and speak it. Every single one of my progressive female coworkers can speak their mind on basically any issue. I  shut up. James Damore spoke his mind and the only message anyone got was ""If you're a man, do not speak your mind.""

6. Canceling men creates an anti-male culture. People who speak up against anti-male shit are at risk of getting cancelled. That means they don't contribute to the culture. The people who do contribute are the ""Men are trash"" crowd. 

Lastly, there are no more male spaces. It is illegal to have a men's only workplace. Traditional male spaces like the military are now working overtime to get women inside. Same goes for male dominated fields. Men just do not have a space  to talk to one another and develop a collective male-based worldview, to give advice on  things like dating without women interfering, and act like men in ways that develop masculine traits --- again, without the interference of women. It is stigmatized to say, ""Women are ruining this spot"" in a way that it's not stigmatized to say ""We need a women's only space.""

-

""Right to sex"" was never the issue. We've really fucked with the general development of men, the ability for men to express their thoughts and feelings, and the ability of men to express their merit and do things like earn money. With  all of this in mind, it's amazing that the situation isn't even more fucked up than it currently is. 

-

Our culture has internalized that ""Men are trash"" that they do not see the merit in males being sidelined from our culture. Men are seen as too trash to have really earned that job, when explicit policies made him have to work the hardest. Men are seen as too trash for their perspectives to be heard. Men are seen as too clueless to have advice for other men that men couldn't have gotten  from a woman, and this extends both  in and out of the dating world. Unfortunately, men have themselves internalized this value and so they usually try  to prove that they're ""one of the good ones"" instead of noticing that they are being underserved. 

-

Rather than deal with there being very strong cultural misandry that has created a socially inept class of incels, people dismiss the issue as ""Some men think they have a right to sex."" I am not of the belief that there is a right to sex. I have a belief  that  there are many other things that men do have a right to, which  would make them much more socially valuable and sexually attractive.",BroadPoint,t2_2s4hqrtz,0.79,31,31
943,6szzgf,2017-08-11,FeMRADebates,"Google Memo, an alternative take.","[This](https://twitter.com/cmclymer/status/895497189304156161) caught my attention, and seeing that it was presented on Twitter, I decided I'd try and replicate it in a somewhat more readable format. To me it seems Charles here is reproducing and magnifying the most hysteric reactions to the memo in question, and turning it around. Now, I'm sure we can all see where it fails, but I'd love to try and take a stab at this from a different angle. What would it look like, if someone took the time to write a similar memo, based on the numbers presented below? So please take a few minutes to read what he's written in its entirety:

-------

Part of the reason for my anger over the Google memo on diversity practices is the hypocrisy of the author on his workplace. When it comes to the workplace, it seems many white men are outraged when THEY feel left out or alienated or threatened. Many white men feel angry at a system they believe has finite resources and unfairly benefits women and folks of color. “Where are my mentorship programs? Where are my summits? Where are my confidence seminars?” ask many white men. I don’t believe James Damore and white men like him are evil, rotten people, but I do think they’re unabashed hypocrites. Here’s why:

If we’re going to play this game on bettering the workplace w/ statistical analysis on race and gender, we should be comprehensive. According to the 2015 FBI Report on Crime in the U.S., 97.5% of all reported rapes were committed by men. Men also committed 87.1% of murders and manslaughters, 85.7% of robberies, and 77.5% of aggravated assaults. Further, men account for 57% of larceny (theft), 61.5% of fraud, 79.5% of vandalism, 71.1% of disorderly conduct. What about race? Whites account for 74.2% of rapes, 73.3% of burglary, 70.4% of larceny, and 68.8% of disorderly conduct. Now let’s put race and gender together: white men account for 72.3% of all rapes, yet make up just 31.5% of the U.S. population. Black women, using this math, commit 0.6% of rapes. A rape is 120x likelier to have been committed by a white man than a black woman.

This analysis should be a red flag to us that re: rape, white men pose a far greater risk to workplace safety than black women. If we do a similar analysis for all other crimes, we will reach the same inference: white men are more dangerous in the workplace. If you’re a white man reading this, there’s a good chance your blood pressure is rising. Maybe you’re indignant and angry. Insulted. And yet, I’m not trying to smear anyone. I am simply using SCIENCE to establish that white males are more likely than anyone to rape. If we’re having an honest conversation, a “freedom of thought” deal, let’s ask: aren’t white men more dangerous than anyone? And if that’s our statistical conclusion, what are James Damore and white male colleagues doing to hold other white men accountable? 

Because I could be wrong, but I have not seen any memos from Damore on the threats, statistically, that white men pose. This is especially concerning because Silicon Valley has had a lot of public trouble lately with sexual assault and harassment. And the vast majority of the perpetrators of those acts? White, heterosexual, cisgender men. Many the heads of their companies. I’m sure James Damore has seen that news. He must have. I figure someone so concerned w/ workplace fairness would address it. So, if his Google memo is truly about “fairness” at work, surely Damore cares how vulnerable women must feel at Google + in SV. Is it a fair work environment when women must always be on guard against sexual harassment and, god forbid, assault and rape?

Because if so, maybe a Google memo should be written that offers a wide variety of suggestions to combat such behavior. Maybe all white men at SV companies should be escorted by an observer at work for accountability. Maybe they should have a curfew. Maybe white men at SV companies should forfeit a percent of their salaries to pay for 72.3% of the cost of consent education programs. And believe me, I am sooo not prejudiced against white men. I respect them. Not all white men are bad. But SCIENCE is SCIENCE, right? 

The numbers don’t lie, so if we’re using SCIENCE to lead us to the light re: the workplace, why not address the behavior of white men? So, a question to white men who feel as Damore does: if I had written this all in a memo, would YOU feel comfortable working with me? I suspect many, maybe most of you, would say “yes”. But some of you wouldn’t. You’d feel uncomfortable. You might even feel unsafe. What if I never apologized? What if I regularly brought it up, even just casually? I imagine, then, most of you would feel threatened.

Take note: this is just the workplace. In this hypothetical, I’m an anomaly. You leave work, you’ll likely not run into folks saying it. But women and folks of color? They have their intelligence, character, experience, and abilities questioned EVERYWHERE. Not just at the workplace. In school, in college, in the media, on the street by complete strangers. Even at home, among family. And that’s before we talk about safety. Street harassment, police brutality, rape, sexual assault, etc. These threats are EVERYWHERE.

This memo isn’t an isolated event. It reflects a wider culture that degrades, doubts, and harms women, folks of color, LGBTQ folks, etc. And my purpose here isn’t to put these groups on a pedestal. At all. Believe me: awful people exist everywhere, these groups included. Nor is my purpose to say white males are bad. But we do enjoy a level of privilege and a livelihood free of that kind of fear and hurt. People should feel safe in the workplace, and I’m sorry, but there’s no reason you should feel “unsafe” over diversity efforts. At all. There are, however, countless reasons why women and folks of color and other communities feel unsafe at work. 

I’m not trying to shame anyone here. I’m asking you to step outside your worldview and consider you might be missing something.

946,ffsf5g,2020-03-09,FeMRADebates,UN Report - Critique of the Recent Data,"Here's a link to the actual study, some interesting data (albeit lacking):

[http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hd\_perspectives\_gsni.pdf](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hd_perspectives_gsni.pdf)

So a few interesting points. Europe and Central Asia has been grouped together in statistics and united states isn't even included in Table 1. I wonder why they were put together. Because I am more than willing to admit that women are discriminated against in certain areas but as the other commenter mentioned, there are ways in which society is against men that this report does not seem to measure. This is the argument of using different scales to measure disadvantaged (as I referenced in another recent post). Interesting that Figrue 4 shows:

>The greater the empowerment, the wider the gender gap  
>  
>This pattern appears in other aspects of development. Women today are the most qualified in history, and newer generations of women have reached parity in enrolment in primary education. But this may not be enough for achieving parity in adulthood, as large differences persist in occupational choices, with the share of female graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programmes lower than 15  percent for most countries.2

This is an interesting aspect:

>People’s expectations of individuals’ roles in households, communities, workplaces and societies can determine a group’s functioning.

Citation needed, pressures can affect people but the argument is the amount to which it determines general trends. For instance, there was a report completed in Ireland which found that [most](https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/more-than-two-thirds-of-women-doing-home-duties-do-not-want-to-return-to-a-paid-job-38071244.html) women *wanted* to work part time. The study they use to support this states...

>First, our event study analysis shows that the relationship between children and labour trajectories is strongly gendered.

But does not seem to demonstrate cause and effect. This could easily be down to decision making between the two partners:

>Although the two groups of women differ in the initial strength of their response, the medium term effect is almost the same.

Maybe women just decide (on average) that they want to be there for their Children as they get older. This certainly isn't true of all women but socialisation has not been clearly defined here. It is just a study to suggest. This is even supported by the study:

>Having children seems to be key to determine whether couples adhere to the norm, with the effect being statistically insignificant for childless couples. When 21 we split the data by education level, we find that the most skilled women reduce their hours of work but do not leave the labor market

I think you can minimise this effect with better policies for women and men around paternity leave but I don't think you can erase them entirely. I have recently done a post on [sex influenced gender differences](https://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/f9u6os/sex_based_differences_between_male_and_female/) looking at this (so I'm not going to explain this all now). It's hard to say it’s just bias shaping decisions - in fact, other confounding data suggests no. This whole study is based on the assumption of bias shaping these gendered dimensions. While it might certainly have an impact, it is by no means the full story. The bias may even come after the fact. It's a chicken or egg scenario, you can't necessarily eradicate bias without changing the norms but you can't change the norms without eradicating bias.

So I think it starts with a flawed premise as it is. Moving on to the data. I find this interesting:

>Progress in the share of men with no gender social norms bias from 2005–2009 to 2010–2014 was largest in Chile, Australia, the United States and the Netherlands, while most countries showed a backlash in the share of women with no gender social norms bias

And yet the gap in these countries aren't shrinking, or the progress is slowing. This suggests to me that working on removing bias can only get you so far. It's interesting that Chile has the largest amount of men with no gender bias and is number [44](http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/GII) in terms of gender equality for GIGI and BIGI suggests that this is better for women, despite them being less likely to be represented in parliament and have less of a share in the labour force [BIGI](https://bigi.genderequality.info/#_data) puts Chile as better for women. This would suggest that people's bias changing does not necessarily affect social norms. And with women becoming more bias in the countries where this is being pushed, it seems that trying to eradicate bias really doesn't seem to be working.

The report also had this to say:

>The multidimensional gender social norms indices appear linked to gender inequality, as might be expected. In countries with higher biases (measured through the multidimensional gender social norms indices), overall inequality (measured by the Gender Inequality Index) is higher (box figure 1). Similarly, the indices are positively related to time spent on unpaid domestic chores and care work.

Again, there was no attempt to measure this. Cause and affect still hasn’t been determined. Humans recognise [patterns](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30385-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627318303854%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#secsectitle0065) and while I have no doubt that negative biases exist and these are unfair, whether or not these biases come about as result of recognisable patterns in the roles women pursue is unclear. Bias is a hard thing to determine cause and effect, there is a whole lot of correlational data but other confounding data that bias does not create these conditions. For instance, a review of the data from stereotype threat revealed conflicting results. Meaning we do not have a clear causal means for it. Interestingly, it seems largely dependent on the population it’s used against. Suggest individual differences play a [huge role](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4713435/).

>However, many of the mediators tested have resulted in varying degrees of empirical support. Below we suggest that stereotype threat may operate in distinct ways dependent on the population under study, the primes utilized, and the instruments used to measure mediation and performance. Further research suggests that populations who tend to have low group identification (e.g., those with a mental illness or obesity) are more susceptible to self-as-target threats…  
>  
>Resultantly, participants under stereotype threat may be unable to observe and explicitly report the operations of their own mind…  
>  
>Two decades of research have demonstrated the harmful effects that stereotype threat can exert on a wide range of populations in a broad array of performance domains. However, findings with regards to the mediators that underpin these effects are equivocal.

We also have good indication that the Implicit Awareness Test so often used to measure bias is inaccurate. With repeated studies really getting above 0.4 on accuracy: [0.32](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~banaji/research/publications/articles/2001_Cunningham_PS.pdf), [0.65](http://faculty.washington.edu/agg/pdf/Lane%20et%20al.UUIAT4.2007.pdf), [0.39](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~banaji/research/publications/articles/2000_Dasgupta_JESP.pdf), [0.4](http://datacolada.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/5161-Bar-Anan-Nosek-Beh-Res-2014-A-comparative-investigation-of-seven-indirect-attitude-measures.pdf).

Bias sucks, and it sucks to be pre-judged before people get a chance to know you, but as to it being the big bad that influences society… I am less convinced. I would say it can definitely influence people, if bias policy is to be put into practice but in terms of bias somehow socialising people on a grand societal scale. This is the claim I’m sceptical of. So let’s look at the data a bit more closely (as close as we can get – as the report doesn’t go into detail). So, anyone who followed this would likely be aware of the 30% figure in regards to people thinking it is justified for a man to beat his partner. The choices provided in the survey were as follows:

>1, never, to 10, always

And in order to define bias, they only had to get 2 and up:

>Strongest form: 2–10

Without a control group of men, and without looking at the raw data it’s hard to say how much of this 30% put 2. This could easily be read as that it’s acceptable for a man to beat their partner when they are in danger. In short, this statistic could be completely conflated. If a woman were to come at a man with a weapon, I would see it as acceptable for the man to defend himself. In general though, I don’t think anyone should be attacking anyone else and I think a woman would have a right to defend herself if the situations were reversed. The rest of the report uses measurements like:

>Strongly agree, agree, disagree, and strongly disagree

Note that this is for women in political positions, and didn’t offer a “neither agree nor disagree metric”. Meaning participants were forced to pick between men and women. Without seeing the breakdown of data, it’s hard to see how prevalent these biases really are. I’m not going to critique it anymore as this seems to be a familiar pattern within the report. Note how the biases don’t tend to get above the 40% range of people believing them. Baring this in mind, let’s now onto other studies in terms of bias. This time actually comparing men and women. For instance, biases have shifted over time. With people seeing women as more communion. With men and women being seen as equal in competence and intelligence but with more people seeing women as competent and intelligent above [men](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-amp0000494.pdf). According to this research the only bias that hasn#t changed is that women are seen as having less agency.

Let's look at a [Pew](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/09/20/women-and-leadership-2018/) study (which actually measures responses comparing attitudes toward the two sexes):

>The survey also finds that Americans largely see men and women as equally capable when it comes to some key qualities and behaviours that are essential for leadership, even as a majority (57%) say men and women in top positions in business and politics tend to have different leadership styles. Among those who say men and women approach leadership differently, 62% say neither is better, while 22% say women generally have the better approach and 15% say men do.

# Conclusion

I don’t know why The UN document doesn’t show us the breakdown of measures, and why it would measure bias against women without measuring bias against men but I am seriously sceptical of these findings. This seems to be consistent with other reports finding the same thing. For instance, I couldn’t find the direct data but this conclusion reported on by the [Huff Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/half-us-men-uncomfortable-with-female-political-leaders_n_5dd30b73e4b0263fbc993674?ri18n=true&ncid=engmodushpmg00000004&guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9jb25zZW50LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0Q29uc2VudD9zZXNzaW9uSWQ9M19jYy1zZXNzaW9uXzg2ZDA2NzViLTQ0NWYtNGFkNy1hZTdjLWM0MDFmOTI5NmVmYSZsYW5nPWVuLXVzJmlubGluZT1mYWxzZQ&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANbMWo1f08zUx3vNN0g9ex2Q3YXaukF-kniRF8F9e-KxgSTceIZRqdiSidOhed_HPDtFnVwwMaqtM7O6vzlIih7H_L0Ht1zpy1_CfMBUVYYBQAOQaWGXgJ-V6UD7RXOZnu_m6kP6WQJFPCasgiF0P1yyCxUfFjKM5QD1dF7rpNdh), found:

>Only 49% of American men say they would feel **very** comfortable with a woman as head of the government

It did not go into details on any other findings, did not show how this compared with biases against men and only spoke about the very comfortable metric (which I assume is the highest metric there is) and could easily be taken as the fact that people aren’t comfortable just because of the gender of a person and to answer yes to being very comfortable could be seen as a form of benevolent sexism. I’m sure I don’t know but it seems hard to draw conclusions from data like this anyway. I am sceptical of this research. Especially seeing as that when women do run for office, they do quite [well](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/05_women_lawless_fox.pdf).

I am not a feminist or an MRA. I only feel the need to preface with this given how uncharitable people can get when you’re even remotely critical of ideologies such as the one’s discussed here. I am also not an anti-feminist - though I do have strong objections to feminist rhetoric, institutions, and academia.

###Introduction

Gender issues - we’re all aware of them. Men and women are expected to conform to certain roles, and are often punished when they don’t.

In the last century an ideology known as feminism emerged and rooted itself in progressive circles. Their initial concerns were legitimate; women couldn’t vote, own property, or divorce, among other things. The ideology achieved many victories, both legislative and social. Today, feminism is more popular than ever, garnering support from celebrities and multinational organizations like the United Nations. It’s taught in many schools as part of their mandatory curriculum, it’s widely supported among most progressives, and many would argue you would need to be one in order to even call yourself a progressive.

Why, then, is feminism so polarizing? Surely, there are plenty of women’s issues that exist today, and aside from far-right tradcons, who could really disagree with the fundamental premise of gender equality? Detractors of the ideology commonly claim that it’s “gone too far” - but what does that even mean? Many progressives claim that detractors of the ideology are reactionaries who simply misunderstand it. Is this really true? What’s actually going on here?

###The Feminist Hypothesis

First, it’s important to define feminism. If asked to define the ideology, most would say something like “the belief that both genders are equal / should be treated equally under the law”. This is an incomplete definition, however. This would be similar to defining liberalism as the belief in democracy. Of course, whilst believing in democracy is a necessary condition of liberalism, it’s not sufficient. Socialists (and even some fascists) believe in democracy, and they certainly aren’t liberals. Liberalism requires other beliefs, such as the right to private property (which socialists reject) and the belief in human rights (which fascists reject).

Feminism, then, is more than just the belief in equality under the law. The other beliefs varies depending on the school of thought, but they’re all united in sharing one fundamental claim: that we live in a patriarchy that privileges men at the expense of women. More specifically, they argue that femininity is seen as inherently inferior to masculinity, and thus, all gender issues are fundamentally rooted in misogyny. For instance, it’s socially acceptable (even celebrated) for women to act masculine (eg, tomboys), but men who act feminine or often punished for it (they might be denigrated with insults that compare them to women - ‘pussy’, ‘sissy’, etc.). You can likely name several films with relatively masculine women (Ripley from Alien, Sarah Connor from Terminator, etc.), but almost no feminine male heroes. Women are punished for being women, men are punished when they aren’t masculine enough.

Feminists conclude that the patriarchy hurts both men and women, and thus, everyone should be feminists and dismantle the patriarchy. 

###Critique

The issue with this hypothesis, and progressive gender ideology as a whole, is that it promotes a massive asymmetry in the way we view men’s issues compared to women’s. Progressives claim to value gender equality, but in reality they end up reinforcing the most rigid form of gender essentialism, even more-so than modern conservatives. This can be seen both in their rhetoric and in the legislation/social policies they support. I will demonstrate this by examining popular rhetoric and arguments used by feminists and progressives.

**Toxic Masculinity**

A controversial term that has emerged in recent years, “toxic masculinity” refers to the harmful set of expectations placed on men that causes them to hurt themselves or others. For instance, men are expected to be stoic, and so they may be less likely to seek out help when they need it. Men are expected to sleep with women, so they may physically lash out when rejected, since sexual conquest is tied to their self-worth.

Many progressives claim that opponents of the term simply misunderstand it, but in reality, the reason people dislike the term is because there is a hypocritical asymmetry since “toxic femininity” is never discussed. Progressives end up being the biggest reinforcers of the traditional “toxic” masculine roles they claim to oppose. 

For instance, the male suicide rate is often condescendingly blamed on “toxic masculinity”. We get the typical spiels from mainstream media about how men are pressured to be stoic, and if they could just open up emotionally, the male suicide rate would drop. This is an utterly bizarre argument, because statistically women are actually more likely to attempt suicide than men (men are more likely to succeed), yet this is never blamed on “toxic femininity”. Notice how mainstream media never claims that women are conditioned to be hyper-emotional, and if they could just learn to suppress their emotions, the attempted female suicide rate would drop. 

Consider too that women tend to not report rape or sexual assault out of a sense of shame or guilt. Would any progressive claim this is a consequence of “toxic femininity” - that women are pressured to be sexually chaste and “pure”, and that explains the lack of reporting? If anyone were to actually make such an argument, those same progressives would likely call them a victim blamer, yet this rhetoric is completely acceptable when it comes to men.

In other words, men and women both share the same reasons for committing suicide or not reporting rape (eg, shame), but it’s only framed as a systemic failure for women. For men, it’s framed as an insecure shortcoming, that they’re letting the pressures of “toxic masculinity” get to them, and they should just “do better” and seek help.

It’s also worth noting that women reinforce these “toxic” gender norms just as much as men, but that’s never acknowledged by progressives. Consider the [controversial Gilette ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0) from a few years ago, where they attempted to “tackle toxic masculinity”. In the entirety of the ad, only men are blamed for reinforcing harmful masculine gender norms, women are completely absolved (aside from a couple of audience members during the sitcom segment). In fact, [at one point the ad shows](https://youtu.be/koPmuEyP3a0?t=29) a male employee silencing a female employee - even when progressives try to talk about men’s issues, they can’t help but make it about women’s issues as well. 

This asymmetry is more explicitly clear when you enumerate all the possibilities:

* Man is sexist against man: Toxic masculinity

* Man is sexist against woman: Toxic masculinity (not “toxic femininity”)

* Woman is sexist against man: Toxic masculinity

* Women is sexist against woman: Internalized Misogyny (not “toxic femininity”)

When men receive sexism, it’s their “toxic masculine gender role” that oppresses them - in other words, they oppress themselves. But when women receive sexism, they are just simply victims to misogyny. If a woman tells a man to man-up, it’s considered toxic masculinity since it reinforces the traditional masculine gender role of stoicism. But if a man criticizes a woman for sexual promiscuity, it’s not considered toxic femininity, despite it reinforcing the traditional feminine gender role of chastity (in fact, it’s considered another instance of toxic masculinity). So whether men or women reinforce harmful gender expectations of either gender, it’s labelled “toxic masculinity”. The term essentially becomes synonymous with “sexism”. This is the fundamental issue people have with the term - the inherit conflation of ‘masculinity’ with ‘sexism’ - the asymmetry. 

The great irony here is that progressives end up reinforcing the very traditional gender norms they claim to be against. That is, that men possess hyper-agency and can never be victims, that their problems are of their own causing, and that women are just helpless victims who do no wrong. 

It's not surprising, then, that the biggest feminist messages to men in the last few years have just reinforced the traditional “toxic” gender norm that men should be protectors. Look at the United Nation's [#HeForShe](https://www.heforshe.org/en) campaign, that suggested men should essentially protect women. It's no different than telling men to ""man up"", it's just rebranded in woke packaging to make it palatable to progressives, and it works. Notice too that these demands are never asked of women (there is no #SheForHe). Progressive demand men to be traditionally masculine, whilst simultaneously criticizing them for it.

**Patriarchy**

There is perhaps no term in modern discourse more useless or vague than “patriarchy”. It’s used as a buzzword by progressives (along with “capitalism” and “white supremacy”) to explain away almost any phenomenon in modern society. Earlier we defined the patriarchy as a social system that “privileges” men at the expense of women (or values masculinity over femininity), but the way progressives have abused this term borders on unfalsifiable tautology - framing all gender issues as women’s issues.

According to progressives, if women commit more suicide than men, that's evidence that we live in a sexist patriarchy. But if men commit suicide more than women, that's also evidence we live in a sexist patriarchy, and this is an instance of the patriarchy hurting men. Men are given harsher sentences for the same crime? Actually that’s patriarchal backfiring, since society views women as having no agency. Women get custody more often? Well that’s because society views women as the caretaker, so it’s actually misogyny. Only men are drafted? Of course, society views women as weak and incapable - misogyny. No matter the outcome, it's always framed as patriarchy/misogyny, it’s just taken as an axiomatic truth.

To test whether a claim is vacuous, a useful exercise is to reverse the situation and see if the conclusion still holds. Suppose we lived a society where gender roles were reversed. Men would have issues with domestic violence, date-rape, representation in politics, wouldn’t be taken as seriously in the workplace, catcalling, were judged more for their looks, etc., and women would have a higher suicide rate, get harsher prison sentences for the same crime, get worse school grades for the same work, it would be legal to cut off their clitoral hoods at birth and suck their genital wounds (the male equivalent would be “oral suction circumcision” - yes this is an actual thing).

Would anyone look at such a society and deem it an “oppressive matriarchy” that “privileges” women over men? If not, then why is it when the roles are reversed (as it is in our society) it’s deemed as an “oppressive patriarchy” that “privileges” men over women?

**Male Privilege** 

Progressives are also very selective when they examine gender inequality, largely overlooking men’s issues, or even framing them as a privilege.

Consider the gender wage gap. Progressives/feminists argue that the reason women earn less than men is because of sexist social pressures that encourage women to be stay-at-home mom’s and discourages them from higher-paying careers. Whether this is truly the result of sexism or biological predispositions is not what I care to discuss, but what is interesting is that the other side is never talked about; that is, that men are socially pressured to earn money. Consider if the roles were reversed; suppose men were pressured to be stay-at-home dad’s and take care of the children, whereas women were pressured to work dangerous jobs, work overtime, and would be considered deadbeats otherwise. 

If this were the case, there would be no discussion of a gender pay gap for men. Instead, we would hear of a gender labor and death gap for women. We would hear complaints that women were expected to work more hours than men, expected to take physically dangerous work, and die more often on the job. We would get statistics about how “on average, women work X amount of hours more than men in a year”. We would hear about the negative health consequences of stress and working overtime, the toll that being the primary breadwinner has on a person, how men need to “step up” and stop placing the burden of income on women alone. Yet, when this expectation is placed upon men, there is zero discussion about the burden of being the breadwinner - in fact, quite the opposite, it’s framed as a privilege.

**”But the Patriarchy hurts men too!”**

One popular talking point among progressives is that the “patriarchy” hurts men as well, and that critics of feminism mistake “patriarchy” as synonymous with “men”, but this is far from the truth.

Consider the recent overturning of Roe v Wade. To be clear, I think the ban is wrong, but the response from many feminists is telling; they immediately jump to blaming men, despite the fact that men and women [share similar views](https://www.vox.com/2019/5/20/18629644/abortion-gender-gap-public-opinion) on abortion. Abortion is split among political lines, not gender lines, and despite progressives wishing the opposite, conservative women do exist.

So here we see the hypocrisy. On one hand they will claim that the patriarchy hurts men and women, and therefore feminism ought to be accepted by men. Yet, as soon as women are hurt by “the patriarchy”, the blame is immediately put on men, despite the fact that women reinforce/uphold harmful gender norms just as much as men. The fact that plenty of women supported the ban is ignored in favour of a convenient “male bad” narrative.

Similarly, if the “patriarchy” ends up hurting men, women’s agency/responsibility is totally ignored, and thus, the blame will lie on men. The term “patriarchy” becomes synonymous with “men”, with progressives blaming all of societies shortcomings on men alone.

If the hypocritical rhetoric is bad, the hypocritical institutions are far worse. Self-proclaimed feminist organizations like the United Nations (which claims to stand for gender equality) [finances the genital mutilation](https://news.un.org/en/story/2011/12/397192-un-launches-plan-accelerate-male-circumcision-aids-prevention-africa) of men in the Third World. whilst condemning the same mutilation of women. Then, that very same institution has the audacity to suggest that “men aren’t doing enough”, that “men need to stand against sexism”, and proceed to roll out initiatives like #HeForShe.  

It’s also worth noting that in the case of circumcision, the discarded foreskin is sometimes used to [produce skincare products](https://thesun.co.uk/fabulous/7836602/foreskin-facial-kate-beckinsale-how-serum-made/) for wealthy celebrities and socialites (likely the same that virtue signal about how misogynistic our society is). Could anyone imagine if male celebrities used skincare products derived from the skin tissue of amputated clitoral hoods from infant girls? Doubtless we would have international outrage and academic discourse about the “commodification of the female body” and whatnot. When it happens to men - radio silence (or mockery).

**Progressives use right-wing rhetoric when it comes to men’s issues**

Men’s issues are dismissed by progressives in the same way black issues are dismissed by conservatives. For instance, progressives blame the fact that men are more likely to be victims of violent crimes on other men, since men commit the majority of violent crime. Notice how this is no different to when conservatives blame black issues on black people. Compare “but it’s mostly men killing other men” to “but it’s mostly black people killing other black people”. Would progressives be okay with terms like “toxic blackness” to describe the negative aspects of black culture - eg, high crime rate, lack of fathers, misogyny in rap music, etc?

Consider the fact that men are given harsher sentences for the same crime, compared to women. Feminists would argue that this is because society assigns hyper-agency to men and views women as weak and infantile, thus, men get harsher sentences. They would argue this is an example of how sexism against women ends up hurting men, that this is our patriarchal society “backfiring” on men. But notice that this logic completely falls apart when you swap gender for race. For instance, black people are sentenced to harsher sentences for the same crime compared to white people. Would any progressive unironically argue that this is because society views white people as weak and incapable, and thus this is an example of how racism against white people ends up hurting black people, that this is our “black supremacist” society backfiring on black people? The latter would be rightfully ridiculed, whereas the former is accepted and taught in sociology classes.

Under the feminist framework, it’s okay to blame men’s biological predispositions to dismiss male violence / male victims of violence, but don’t you dare suggest that those same biological predispositions may explain why men are more likely to be CEO’s. In other words, men’s failures are their responsibility, but their successes are not - their successes are the result of sexism, they’re illegitimate. (To be clear, I am not suggesting that biological predispositions are indeed the reason why men are more likely to be CEO’s; I am merely pointing out the hypocritical reasoning)


**Media**

So how are men’s issues talked about by the media? Well, for the most part, they aren’t. But when they are, it can vary from blaming men for their issues (the typical spiels on toxic masculinity) to outright hostility.

“Progressive” media outlet, Slate, once [ran an Op-Ed](https://slate.com/technology/2013/09/intactivists-online-a-fringe-group-turned-the-internet-against-circumcision.html) where they characterized and straw-manned the entire anti-circumcision movement as nothing but unhinged freaks, comparing them to anti-vaxxers. The article goes into great length smugly psycho-analyzing the motives of these activists, not even pretending to show balance or their side of the argument.

The United Nations absurdly claimed that [women would be the most impacted](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/11/un-women-says-russia-ukraine-war-exacts-high-price-from-women-girls.html) in regards to the invasion of Ukraine, despite men (some still being in high school) being banned from leaving the country. Evidently, men being forcibly conscripted to fight and possibly die doesn’t count as gender-based violence. It’s also worth noting that the UN emphasizes girls specifically, rather than all child refugees (boys and girls). Again, this is the same institution that tells men they just need to “do better” and stand up against inequality. 
 
Vice, another “progressive” outlet, [recently wrote an article](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3vx8k/south-korea-incel-gender-wars-election-womens-rights) about the South Korean election, titled “Young, Angry, Misogynistic, and Male: Inside South Korea’s Incel Election”. 

To summarize, the article describes how anti-feminist rhetoric has emerged as an electoral campaign topic among the populist candidate Yoon Suk-Yeol (in fact, he won the election as of writing this). The article mentions how these male voters feel disenfranchised from South Korean society, given the blatant double standards. For instance, military service is mandatory for men when they finish high school, but not for women. This means men have to abandon their families for 1.5 years while women get a head start in their careers. The candidate, Yoon, vowed to abolish the Ministry of Women, a division of the government concerned with women’s issues. Aside from some vague mentions of political bias and claims that the ministry “treats men like criminals”, the article never describes why he wants to abolish it, or why the voters want him to abolish it, it’s just taken as a presupposition that the Ministry is fair and just. 

That’s it. That’s the entire article. This, according to Vice, makes you a “misogynistic incel”. We’re so deeply-entrenched in “progressive” gender politics that merely pointing out the double standard that men must do mandatory service is enough for “progressive” outlets to label you a women-hating incel. There’s not a single man they interview in the article that express any entitlement to women. Just being opposed to the hypocrisy makes you an incel apparently.

It’s totally possible that the candidate is indeed a misogynist or has sexist policy positions - I don’t know much about South Korea - but the greater point here is that the article never mentions any of this. According to the internal logic of Vice, men merely being upset at blatant double standards is enough for them to be labelled misogynistic incels. It’s also worth noting the hypocrisy of these “progressive” media outlets in labelling young men who are rightfully upset about being discriminated against as incels, despite these same outlets decrying how widespread “toxic masculinity” is, completely oblivious to how they reinforce it by characterizing any man who points out male discrimination as being a bitter, angry virgin.

None of these articles were hard to find. I found the first one through a basic google search, and the other two from trending twitter/reddit posts. There are dozens of more like this written every year, this was just a small sampling of how ridiculously hysterical progressive media is towards men’s issues.

**Nice Guys**

Speaking of incels, the entire phenomenon of ""nice guys"" (men who disingenuously befriend women in an attempt to sleep with them) is ironically exacerbated by the very same ""progressives"" who claim to want to ""liberate"" men from their confined gender roles.

Progressives, and mainstream media as a whole, demonizes male sexuality, characterizing it as creepy or predatory. Consider again the controversial Gilette ad from a few years back. There's a [scene where a man goes to approach a woman](https://youtu.be/koPmuEyP3a0?t=56), and then is stopped by his friend. It's the middle of the day, broad daylight, busy street, etc. so the woman is in no danger, yet according to progressives, even approaching women in public is problematic nowadays.

It’s no surprise that teenage boys take these messages to heart - that they’re inherently predatory and must suppress any desire to be blunt or forthcoming with what they want. They act amicable, nice, and passive, because that’s what they were told to do, and more importantly, they don’t want to risk being branded as a creep or sexual predator. When this inevitably doesn’t work out, they express frustration, and then the very same group that told them to act that way demonizes and mocks them for it.

It’s no surprise then why figures like Jordan Peterson and Andrew Tate get popular. The right-wing gives an alternative to alienated young men that doesn’t demonize them for being born with a penis.

###Conclusion

The message from progressives/feminists is clear. Women’s issues are caused by society, and so society must change to accommodate women. Men’s issues are caused by men, and so men must “do better” and change to accommodate society. Women’s issues are systemic - men’s issues are individual failures. Social change for women - pull yourself by your bootstraps for men. 

Under the feminist framework, sexism against men is framed as male privilege, whereas sexism that benefits women is framed as female oppression (consider the term “benevolent” sexism - even when women benefit, they’re still victims). Their rhetoric and language portray a victim narrative for women, and an oppressor narrative for men, no matter the circumstance.    

At the heart of progressive gender ideology is this absurd notion of trickle-down equality - that if we just focus on fixing women’s issues, men’s issues will just magically solve themselves. As time has come to past, it’s clear that this is simply not true. Women have made great strides in almost all sectors of life, whereas men have stagnated or even regressed, usually as the result of questionable social policies created in the name of “equity”. It is now blatantly clear that schools discriminate against male students for the same work compared to women, that universities and employers favour female candidates, and that ironic misandry is tolerated (even encouraged) in the public sphere, but even mentioning this is considered controversial. 

Progressives and feminists fundamentally view gender equality as a zero-sum game. Attention and resources given to men’s issues are resources that could be used towards women’s issues. In doing so, they must frame any good-faith opposition to their absurd ideology as right-wing reactionaries (take the “Manosphere” for instance - a new buzzword that lumps mass murdering incels with pick-up artists and men’s right’s activists - despite these groups having almost nothing in common). 

All of this goes to show what is essentially tantamount to gaslighting on a global scale. 

“The patriarchy hurts both men and women” - but women’s issues are the only one’s taken seriously, whereas men’s issues are treated with condescension (or ignored). 

“Both genders reinforce harmful gender norms” - but only men are told to change, whereas women are assumed to be perfect.

“We should encourage men to speak up about gender issues” - but if they do they’ll be labelled a misogynistic incel.

“Feminism is for men” - but feminist organizations actively support blatantly anti-male legislation and policies (eg, UN financing male circumcision in the Third World).

The progressive hostility towards men’s issues is directly responsible for the rise of people like Andrew Tate, and I fully expect more figures like him to gain popularity in the near future. It’s hard to express just how frustrating it is to see even the most trivial of women’s issues discussed ad-naseum by progressives and mainstream media (eg, female multimillionaire actresses make slightly less than their male counterparts), whereas some of the most egregious human rights violations still being legal to commit against men is totally ignored, or even supported. The progressive failure has obviously reached a tipping point now - red pill content has exploded in popularity over the last year, and when the pendulum swings back, I expect there will be a fierce overcorrection from progressives. Unless progressives become willing to actually discuss men’s issues, things are only going to get worse, but chances of that seem slim.",Smokeydozer,t2_vcb78t17,0.92,57,58

EEOC definition of sexual harassment is done to an employee: https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm

https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/sexual-harassment/

>Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination, it is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Title 7 is noteworthy here as it applies mostly to employers of a certain size and they can be held liable if they had knowledge of sexual harassment.

If we assume that some kind of sexual advance happened from a male employee to a female employer, and then the employer sat on this information for a number of years that theoretically the female employer could be held liable under title VII as they fostered an unsafe workplace.

My questions:

1- Do you think the legal definition of sexual assault, one that is only one directional that happens to employees, is best left as is or should it be changed?

2- Is it fair to have a trial over a night where multiple parties were drunk 6 years ago where memories are clearly fuzzy now?

3- Under the exact wording of Title VII, shall this employer be held liable for fostering a hostile work environment for not reporting these sexual advances for this long? Do you agree with said findings?

4- In this time period of lots of people coming out about alleged sexual grievances in the past, do you believe something occurred here?

5- How do you feel about a man using a ""power definition"" to define whether or not an act occurred or not? Would you feel the same is the sexes were reversed and a woman was accused of performing these acts used this defense? Why?

5a- Would the sex of the employee/employer matter to find a company guilty of condoning a unsafe work environment? Should it matter?

953,g40521,2020-04-19,FeMRADebates,The unacknowledged distinction of Gender Dysphoria vs. Sex Dysphoria,"(I will start off by saying I fully support anyone's right to undergo a sex change if they think it's the best thing for them. This post is NOT advocating anti-trans ideology.)

Sex dysphoria: When you strongly dislike your physical sex characteristics and wish you had the physical characteristics of the other sex. This is a body image disorder. The best known cure is to undergo a sex change.

Gender dysphoria: Distress caused by the demands and restrictions placed on you by your gender. A desire to be able to behave freely in ways that don't conform to your birth gender. The ""cure"" for gender dysphoria is to simply shrug off the chains of your gender and be who you want to be (you can switch to the other gender, or become non-binary, or agender, or whatever).

This is a distinction that I think is important but is not widely acknowledged. In practice, it seems that sex and gender dysphoria often go hand in hand (not always, but very often). But is this an intrinsic fact of human life, or is this a result of popular narrative that sex and gender are intrinsically linked?

Perhaps some people undergo a sex change not because they are truly uncomfortable in the body they were born in, but rather because they feel it's the only way to get other people to acknowledge and validate their gender identity. If someone with a muscular build, a beard, and a penis wants to be accepted into women's spaces, and be able to participate in ""girl stuff"", they would probably be rejected (and many women would see it as an invasion of their spaces). Therefore, this person may feel a need to change their body in order to be accepted as a woman.

----------

Now, this is where the level-headed factual discussion ends and I plug my ideology. Personally, I think the concept of gender should be abolished. The idea that there should be ""women's spaces"" or ""men's spaces"", ""girl business"" and ""boy business"", is, IMO, profoundly harmful. For reasons I can't understand, people seem to feel a need to try and make their gender identity into some sort of exclusive club. This only breeds alienation. Just let people be people. Let people come and go as they please into all spaces. Tear down any preconceived notions of what is a ""man"" or what is a ""woman"" - in fact, fight the very notion that there are any traits that apply to ""men"" or ""women"" generally. And then once you've gotten to that point, gender categories are irrelevant.",HumanSpinach2,t2_34528204,0.82,25,72
954,6v6n6h,2017-08-21,FeMRADebates,More Google Trouble,"Following up the recent fun with [Daily Stormer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/08/14/godaddy-bans-neo-nazi-site-daily-stormer-for-disparaging-woman-killed-at-charlottesville-rally/), Google has once again completely banned someone from its services.

Unlike Anglin, however, this man appears to be a rather anodyne Indian [adjunct statistics professor](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-08-21/one-statistics-professor-was-just-banned-google-here-his-story). He appears to run a blog discussing finance, mathematics, and statistics. It is unclear if he is involved in neo-Nazism, though I highly doubt it.

I can't say I shed too many tears for Anglin, but this episode has started to make me think. Google is exerting a near-absolute power over our lives, and is acting in bad faith time and again. Can you imagine losing your entire email account without warning? It would do irreparable damage to our careers.

In the last few years, it has become fashionable on the Left to celebrate corporate power (""The 1st Amendment only stops the government blah blah""). Of course, this argument isn't applicable to Google: the check on corporate abuse is that in a free market, you can choose new corporations to conduct business with. With Google being gargantuan enough to lose [anti-trust suits](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/technology/eu-google-fine.html), it's obvious that we have a case of market failure. If the market doesn't work, then an all-encompassing corporation is simply a totalitarian entity.

But regardless, the ""let corporations have unlimited power"" argument is still fashionable on the Left. Noam Chomsky's (an anarcho-communist) critique of corporations as [""private tyrannies""](http://www.ontheissues.org/celeb/Noam_Chomsky_Corporations.htm) couldn't be written today. Whatever our disagreements, I hope we can come together and agree that no single entity should have the power that Google does without public oversight. Because it won't just be neo-Nazis they come after, and this episode proves it.",__Rhand__,t2_l5grq,0.91,48,71
955,552uq0,2016-09-29,FeMRADebates,The Election...,"So I woke up crazy early this morning and then plans fell through. I went on Facebook, and my news feed is full of stuff like [this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-womack/stop-pretending-you-dont-_b_12191766.html?ncid=engmodushpmg00000003).

I've been seeing a lot of it, and it honestly makes me uneasy. It's essentially the same attitude I've seen from many feminists, on a plethora of subjects. ""If you're not with us/don't do this [thing], you're just misogynist/hate women/are afraid of women/blah blah blah.""

We all know this election is a shit-show. I certainly won't be voting for Trump, but I probably won't vote for Hillary either. 

The reason is, from my POV, Hillary is CLEARLY on team Women. As someone said here recently (can't remember exactly who, sorry), she and many of her supporters have the attitude that she *deserves* to win, because she's a woman. It's [current year] and all that.

Over the years, gender related issues have become very important to me. For a long time I had issues with confidence, self-esteem, and self-worth in general, and most of that stemmed from the rhetoric of (some) feminists. I felt bad for being a man, for wanting/enjoying (stereotypically) masculine things, for wanting a clearly defined masculine/feminine dichotomy in my relationships, etc. 

To me Hillary seems like she's firmly in that camp. If she gets elected, I worry that those people will be re-invigorated, and that those attitudes that led to me being depressed and ashamed of my self as a man, will only get stronger and more prevalent. 

I'm thinking of going to College in the spring, and I worry about her stance on 'Sexual Assault on Campus.' Will she spread the 'yes means yes/enthusiastic consent' ideas that have already led to many men being expelled/socially ostracized/etc? 

I've had trouble with employment for years. Will she continue to push the idea that men are privileged and need to 'step aside' and let women take the reigns? Will she continue to add to the many scholarships, business related resources, and affirmative action that are already available to women exclusively?

I'm an artist, and I want to end up creating a graphic novel, or working in the video game industry (ideally both). Will she continue to give validity to the concepts of 'Male Gaze,' 'Objectification' etc, that stalled my progress and made me feel guilty for creating and enjoying such art for years?

Will she invigorate the rhetoric that any man who wants to embrace his gender, and wants to be with a woman who does the same, is a prehistoric chauvinist? Will terms like 'manspreading', 'mansplaining', and 'manterrupting', just get more popular and become more widely used? (Example, my autocorrect doesn't recognize manspreading and manterrupting, but it does think mansplaining is a word, and if I do right click->look up, it takes me to a handy dictionary definition...)

What this post boils down to is this question: What would Hillary do for me? What is her stance on male gender related issues, and not just for men that don't fit the masculine gender role. So far what I've found only reinforces all of my worries above, that she's on Team Woman, not Team Everyone.

- Some feminists will use this to point a finger at the ""manosphere"" as being sexist. 
- The fact that Diana, Wonder Woman, comes from an island that forbids men from stepping on it will never be addressed. 

Or some variation of the above. Needless to say, it will result in stupid controversy.

964,15i2644,2023-08-04,FeMRADebates,"Opinion : The statement ""women have to stay at home with the children while men can go out and work"" comes with 2 false implications.","In fact, I find that the statement ""women can stay at home with the children while men have to go out and work"" is an equally reasonable statement. But only in the sense that both statements are unreasonable. 

**False implication number one : Women don't have a choice but men do.** ""Have to"" implies a lack of choice, ""can"" implies the existence of choice. While it is true that historically (and depending on where you live to this day) men do have the option to not become a parent more than women. But the moment men want to become a father, choice vanishes. The simply reality is that the more strictly gender norms are enforced on women, the more strictly gender norms are enforced on men. Unless either partner is some billionaire trust fund kid, if the role of the woman is to stay at home with the children, the role of the man is to go out and work, to earn money so that his wife and children are taken care of. Because otherwise they will become homeless and starve to death. *The less choice mothers have, the less choice fathers have.* 

**False implication number two: The men's side is inherently better.** (Which I believe is a result of systematically looking at the benefits for men while ignoring the downsides, and the reverse for women.) I understand it must be extremely frustrating for a woman who wants to pursue a fulfilling career not being able to. But I believe the reality here (I don't have any data on this, so this is definitely the flimsiest part of my argument) is that a fulfilling career is still a minority experience amongst men too. I believe that most people don't love their jobs, they don't even like it. I believe most people find a job they can tolerate just enough so that they don't run into their boss's office screaming they quit. And circling back to the first false implication, when the man is the sole breadwinner, he often has no choice but to take a job that does make him want to do exactly what I wrote in my previous sentence, but he simply can't because he can't let his wife and children starve. 

That statement might have been valid in the past when you could support an entire household on a standard full-time job. But that's not the economic reality we live in nowadays. Being the sole breadwinner nowadays typically means working way more than the standard full time hours. And I don't see how working 50-60 hours a week at a job you hate is any more dignified than being a stay at home parent. This is also a contribution to men dying earlier, as they more frequently sacrifice their physical and mental health for the sake of their family. It's also part of the reason why the vast majority of shitty and dangerous jobs (sewage, construction, roadside work, garbage disposal etc) are done by men, contributing to the fact that men are far more likely to get injured or die on the job. These are all negatives that come with ""being able to go out and work."" 

Meanwhile, yes, being the only one home with an infant is a shitty experience, often literally. You have virtually zero time for yourself and zero sleep as your infant needs 24/7 attention. But something I noticed parents often say, is that seeing your baby smile at you brings a whole new feeling they have never experienced before, and one that is extremely fulfilling. To the point that parents can deal with all of the crap that comes with it. Well, mothers get to enjoy that sensation more. *Mothers get to spend more time with their children.* Mothers are more likely to experience their child's first words and first walk. And sure, in the modern age, there is a good chance it will be filmed. But seeing it on tape is not nearly the same thing as seeing it happen live in front of you. So mothers get to deal with more of the shit that comes with being a parent, but they also get more of the benefits.

Final thought : Both sides of those very strict gender norms suck and I wouldn't wish it on anyone, I want men and women to both be able to experience a healthy work-life balance. (Although that doesn't *necessarily* come with an exact even 50/50 split among work, family and household.)",MGsubbie,t2_o3xho,0.84,13,62

Uses Husband's Last Name.,"I came across an [old essay](http://faculty.georgetown.edu/tannend/nyt062093.htm) by a linguist about ""marked"" women and ""unmarked men"". It's relatively short, so I recommend reading all of it, but some parts in particular stuck out to me:

>The unmarked forms of most English words also convey ""male."" Being male is the unmarked case. Endings like ess and ette mark words as ""female."" Unfortunately, they also tend to mark them for frivolousness. Would you feel safe entrusting your life to a doctorette? Alfre Woodard, who was an Oscar nominee for best supporting actress, says she identifies herself as an actor because ""actresses worry about eyelashes and cellulite, and women who are actors worry about the characters we are playing."" Gender markers pick up extra meanings that reflect common associations with the female gender: not quite serious, often sexual. 

>...Women can't even fill out a form without telling stories about themselves. Most forms give four titles to choose from. ""Mr."" carries no meaning other than that the respondent is male. But a woman who checks ""Mrs."" or ""Miss"" communicates not only whether she has been married but also whether she has conservative tastes in forms of address -- and probably other conservative values as well. Checking ""Ms."" declines to let on about marriage (checking ""Mr."" declines nothing since nothing was asked), but it also marks her as either liberated or rebellious, depending on the observer's attitudes and assumptions. 

>...Fasold ends his discussion of these matters by pointing out that if language reflected biology, grammar books would direct us to use ""she"" to include males and females and ""he"" only for specifically male referents. But they don't. They tell us that ""he"" means ""he or she,"" and that ""she"" is used only if the referent is specifically female. This use of ""he"" as the sex-indefinite pronoun is an innovation introduced into English by grammarians in the 18th and 19th centuries, according to Peter Muhlhausler and Rom Harre in ""Pronouns and People."" From at least about 1500, the correct sex-indefinite pronoun was ""they,"" as it still is in casual spoken English. In other words, the female was declared by grammarians to be the marked case. 

>Writing this article may mark me not as a writer, not as a linguist, not as an analyst of human behavior, but as a feminist -- which will have positive or negative, but in any case powerful, connotations for readers. Yet I doubt that anyone reading Ralph Fasold's book would put that label on him. 

>I discovered the markedness inherent in the very topic of gender after writing a book on differences in conversational style based on geographical region, ethnicity, class, age and gender. When I was interviewed, the vast majority of journalists wanted to talk about the differences between women and men. While I thought I was simply describing what I observed -- something I had learned to do as a researcher -- merely mentioning women and men marked me as a feminist for some. 

>When I wrote a book devoted to gender differences in ways of speaking, I sent the manuscript to five male colleagues, asking them to alert me to any interpretation, phrasing or wording that might seem unfairly negative toward men. Even so, when the book came out, I encountered responses like that of the television talk show host who, after interviewing me, turned to the audience and asked if they thought I was male-bashing. 

>Leaping upon a poor fellow who affably nodded in agreement, she made him stand and asked, ""Did what she said accurately describe you?"" ""Oh, yes,"" he answered. ""That's me exactly."" 'And what she said about women -- does that sound like your wife?"" ""Oh yes,"" he responded. ""That's her exactly."" ""Then why do you think she's male-bashing?"" He answered, with disarming honesty, ""Because she's a woman and she's saying things about men."" 

>To say anything about women and men without marking oneself as either feminist or anti-feminist, male-basher or apologist for men seems as impossible for a woman as trying to get dressed in the morning without inviting interpretations of her character. Sitting at the conference table musing on these matters, I felt sad to think that we women didn't have the freedom to be unmarked that the men sitting next to us had. Some days you just want to get dressed and go about your business. But if you're a woman, you can't, because there is no unmarked woman.

---------------------------------------

I am using a throwaway account for obvious reasons, and unfortunately I have to be somewhat vague.

First, the background: I am a woman working in the STEM part of a STEM-based company (ie: non-HR, non-accounting, etc.). I have worked at this company for several years and, in addition to my Sr. role, I have developed a reputation as one of the people to go to when technical problems arise.

Between 1 and 1.5 years ago another woman joined the technical staff in my department. While her work and work ethic has been completely acceptable, it does not stand out, and regretfully she has made several of the same large errors repeatedly. Both I and others in the department have attempted to help her on this, and to her credit, now her errors are in line with the normal mistakes that everyone with her experience level makes from time to time.

Sometime within the last few months two men in our department were promoted. One that joined the department within the same hiring period as she did, and one that joined some months later. The woman in question did not get promoted. In all three cases I was consulted, and in all three cases the result was in line with my recommendation. While everyone in our department knows that I am consulted on these matters, as a matter of department cohesiveness I do my best to never reveal what my input was.

During our talks, I have gotten to know her fairly well, and can state that she was far more involved with feminist organizations in college than I ever was. Additionally, from her postings on social media sites, her worldview falls in line with many of the traditional feminist ideas and ideals. Recently she has expressed to me and other women in our company that she feels that the reason she was passed over for promotion, and the two men were not, is due to sexism. While I have tried to hint that the two men have performed quite exceptionally in their time here and she has not, and some of the men in our department have attempted to do the same, all signs point to the conclusion that she either does not understand this or has chosen to not understand this. The friction she has generated as a result has begun to affect the quality of work from our department.

With that as the background, my question is this:

What language in the feminist lexicon exists that I can use to the next time we have this discussion to inform her that the actual reason that she wasn't promoted was due to her own lacking qualifications, and not due to sexism? Are there specific words and/or phrases that can be employed that would make her realize that the sexism she perceives is not actually there? How can I best use the language of feminism to convey the fact that she was judged on her merits and not, as she has expressed, her gender?

To be clear, there have been rather blatant instances of sexism in this company in the past, and early on I had to fight to get select individuals removed. And while things are not perfect, they fit within acceptable tolerances and continue to improve.

I firmly believe that she will continue to be an asset, and I would rather not have her leave the company. I am hoping to get some guidance here on best explaining to her that in this specific instance her perception of sexism is not based in reality.",throwaway52684,t2_hdku8,0.77,22,68
973,2w8tss,2015-02-17,FeMRADebates,Is an anti-feminist necessarily anti-woman?,"Is an anti-feminist necessarily anti-woman? 

To answer this question, first we must determine what is meant by “anti-feminist.” Anti-feminist can mean a couple of things: (1) a person or group who advocates for eliminating all gains and influence of feminism, and/or (2) a person or group who advocates for eliminating all future gains and influence of feminism.

If it is the first meaning that I mentioned, then I think an anti-feminist would necessarily be anti-woman, since the position would intend to take away rights from women. If it is only the second meaning, then I think there is still the possibility of an egalitarian movement to exist that would still work to ensure the protection and advancement of women’s rights. 

But what would this egalitarian movement look like, and can it, too, be anti-feminist? An egalitarian movement would strive to be comprehensive in its approach, since its concern is to protect and advance the rights of all persons. However, if this movement’s goal is to eliminate the causes of inequality, then I believe its efforts would likely fall back to focusing on issues that affect a particular gender, racial/ethnic group, class, etc., since these identities are still used to confer status in society. 

Any instance where this movement focused on advancing or protecting the rights of women would be feminism by definition, and hence, “egalitarian” and ""anti-feminist"" would be contradictory positions. The second meaning of ""anti-feminist"" is therefore impossible, leaving only the first meaning of ""anti-feminist.""

After being inspired by [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/2y5go0/where_are_all_the_feminists/cp6op55?context=3) comment chain, /u/femmecheng and myself (henceforth referred to as ‘we’) have decided to author a series that will attempt to take a comprehensive look at various issues and the ways in which both men and women are affected, and subsequently how to fix said issues. For more information about this series, please see [the first post in the series](http://np.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/2yr8n5/inclusive_indepth_investigations_of_issues_1_rape/).

###A Few Notes

For this post, we are mostly focusing on work-life balance (WLB) and work issues in the USA and other industrialized countries such as Canada or western Europe. WLB and work issues in developing countries are things we do not know a lot about and is contextually different enough from WLB and work issues in industrialized countries (due to technology, legal, and social reasons) to warrant a separate post. 

Secondly, keeping with [our deep-seated belief that arguing over who has it worse is ineffective for promoting change](http://np.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/2s4p9u/cmv_arguing_over_who_has_it_worse_is_mostly_a/), we are going to try to focus strictly on the negative effects these issues can cause and ways to mitigate said harm, instead of trying to dictate which gender has it worse. 

---

### Introduction to the Issue

In many ways, the issues of WLB and work issues are less flashy than rape, the topic of our last post^1 .   Yet what it lacks in sensationalism, it makes up for in the widespread nature of its impact.  This is an issue that by its very nature has affected, or will affect, virtually everyone reading this, as almost everyone will be employed at some point in their lives.  While the pervasiveness of this issue makes it relevant to many of you, it also makes it harder to address, due to the fact that almost everyone holds some interest in it.  This difficulty is compounded by the fact that this problem involves many of the fundamental differences in political and economic philosophy that divide our society.  For example, classically liberal individuals would tend to oppose government mandates that employers provide paid maternity leave or affirmative action in hiring, promotions, and raises, whereas progressives would tend to support those same measures.  In some ways, this makes this a very worthy subject to address, as it cuts to the heart of gender issues.

---

Now we are going to try and break down the ways in which men and women are affected by WLB and work issues. The sections below are suggestions. They do not in any way imply that a man cannot face an issue that we placed under the woman’s section, or vice versa. This list we believe to be comprehensive, but is certainly not exhaustive.

###Negative Effects on Women

* Pay Gap

An obvious point to talk about is the pay gap (deep breaths). We are all familiar with the “A woman makes 77 cents to every man’s dollar” oft-trotted and oft-criticized line. However, people need to be careful with what exactly they are discussing. “The average woman makes 77 cents (roughly) to every average man’s dollar” is technically true. “The average woman makes 77 cents (roughly) to every average man’s dollar *for equal work*” is not.  When taking into account factors such as hours worked, time taken off to raise children, etc. (i.e. “choices”), [the pay gap narrows to about 5-7%](http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf). While this study does not account for everything, it does a good job of accounting for many factors, and an unexplained and unexamined gap is still evidence of discrimination that can have long-term effects (a 5-7% increase in pay can translate to hundreds of thousands of dollar over the course of a career). 

[Some people have analyzed data that points to a reversing trend](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1930277_1930124_1930127,00.html)^2. However, it is important to note what the author concludes from the study. That is, that the reversing gap only applies to unmarried, childless women under the age of 30 who live in cities. The original author of the study states [that there are even more things to consider](http://transitions.s410.sureserver.com/tag/james-chung/), such as the type of jobs available (knowledge vs. physical based jobs), demographics of the city, and whether a city has a “decimated manufacturing base”. As almost all women do not remain under the age of 30, unmarried, and childless (and indeed, this is the demographic that is the most likely to have the most education which generally translates to better pay), these results need to follow the CONSAD study and account for more factors such as job type and hours worked. 

Furthermore, a big assumption in the “choice” argument is that it assumes that choices are made in a vacuum. Handwaving away the wage gap that is attributable to something such as time taken off to raise children does the job of explaining why something is the way it is at the surface level, but does not take into account the reasoning behind why various choices are made. For example, if women are assumed to be more responsible for their families even if they don’t want to be, it would of course make sense that this would then be reflected in women, on average, taking more time off from their professional careers to care for their family, unless women are now impervious to societal influence. This is not to say that some women do not make that choice for their own benefit or without fully understanding the compromise they are making to their careers, but it is important to note that some women will make this compromise even if it does not benefit them, their partner, or their family in the long run. On the other hand, it is also important to recognize that while this is true, it’s unfair, perhaps even insulting, to blame all choices on culture, and that is not what we seek to do here. 

Additionally, in stating ways in which women contribute to this problem, some people mention factors not accounted for such as men being more likely to ask for things such as promotions, raises, and higher starting salaries. What these statements do not always account for are the ways in which [women are actually penalized by asking for them](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/cfawis/bowles.pdf), how interviewers [make their expectations different for women than they do for men to justify hiring discrimination](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2008.00454.x/abstract), or how [women receive negative backlash when acting the same way a man does in the workplace](http://asq.sagepub.com/content/56/4/622.abstract). Therefore, it is not always as easy as encouraging women to change to match competitive business hiring and promotion strategies, but rather there needs to be a change in the perception of women and their role in the work place. 

Furthermore, while it is generally thought to be ideal for pay to reflect performance, and in theory this may be possible, [it is not always (or even often) realized in the working world](http://gas.sagepub.com/content/26/3/488.abstract), and this needs to be taken into consideration when advocating for a merit-based system. 

* Societal Expectations to “Be It All”

For whatever reason, the expectation/desire to become a good mother is still very present in women in the developed world.  But women are increasingly feeling a relatively new presure/desire: to pursue a career in their own right.  Holding down a job is hard.  Being a good parent is also hard.  Doing both at the same time - which many women now feel pressured to do - can be very hard, and induce unneeded suffering.

* Pregnancy Laws

There are ample examples of [breaches of pregnancy laws](http://www.mcmillan.ca/Family-Status-Quo-Failure-to-Reinstate-Employee-After-MaternityParental-Leave-Breaches-Human-Rights-Legislation?utm_source=Mondaq&utm_medium=syndication&utm_campaign=View-Original) and [cases going to trial](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/young-v-united-parcel-service/) where women are, or are supposedly, discriminated against for being pregnant. Most claims are that employees do not give back positions that were held before a woman left for maternity leave, or other illegal behaviour such as not providing reasonable accommodations for work tasks. Often, [compensation for such behaviour is meagre](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/3-pregnancy-discrimination-cases-settled-in-n-s-last-year-1.2616492). 

* Health Impacts

There are certain health impacts that negatively affect women to a degree that they do not typically impact men. For example, working long hours has been shown [to have an increased risk of depression and anxiety amongst women](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=12DE29E886A4AAE513B8CF01BFC2DACB.journals?fromPage=online&aid=8415489).

###Negative Effects on Men

* Death Gap 

Perhaps the most well known of ways that men are harmed by gender issues in the workplace is the “death gap”.  [According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfch0012.pdf), males^3 accounted for 93% of workplace deaths in 2013, whereas females accounted for 7%.  Even after controlling for hours worked, males still accounted for 91% of workplace fatalities.  All four of the most dangerous industries in 2013^4 are dominated by men^5 . 

* Family Time

Another way in which men tend to be harmed by gender issues in the workplace is by being deprived of the emotional connection with the very people they are working to support.  Although neither one of us is a parent, one of us can testify to the negative effects of being deprived of time together with one’s family. [These effects include an increased risk of depression and family conflict](http://www.apa.org/monitor/jun02/employees.aspx).

* Health Impacts

In certain ways, the typical effects of long working hours are different for men than women. For example, [men have an increased risk of death when working more than 55 hours](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/6/1820.full.pdf+html), with a significantly higher risk of death associated with heart/cardiovascular disease. 

---

###Negative Effects on Both

* Happiness

Although somewhat obvious and perhaps overly broad, we feel it is worth discussing the impact this issue has on the general happiness of individuals.  If you accept, as we both do, that individuals may define their own preferences however they please, then it follows that coercive influences - be they overt or subtle - upon a rational^6 agent cannot have any positive effect on their happiness, but may well cause negative effects.  Ergo, the expected effect of coercive influences on happiness is necessarily negative.  Everyone should be able to decide for themselves (and by agreement with others, as appropriate) what field they would like to work in, how much they should devote to their career versus their family and personal life, and how best to divvy personal and professional responsibilities.

* Children and Family

Men and women are both affected when a child comes into their lives. Women, if working, have to leave their careers at some point to actually give birth and recover. It is understandable and likely that the father is concerned about the well-being of both the child and the mother during this time, leading to high levels of stress. Furthermore, once the child is actually taken home, there is a new body in the home that requires a lot of attention, meaning that both parents may not be fully “there” when/if at work^8 and stressed when at home. 

This isn’t the only way child rearing can cause stress for parents.  Difficult and often unrealistic expectations can have a similar effect.  Fathers being expected to provide for their families - while simultaneously not spending as much time with them as they may well desire - can be the cause of a non-negligible amount of stress, as can the the pressure to “have it all” by balancing a career and a family without sacrificing either one that is increasingly felt by mothers. Indeed, employees working long hours is [linked to an increase in family conflict](http://www.apa.org/monitor/jun02/employees.aspx).

976,59kt8x,2016-10-26,FeMRADebates,"Two studies suggesting male cognitive function is impacted by mixed-sex interaction. Is this bad science? If not, then what does that mean?","So, while discussing something in another thread on this sub, I came across the claim that heterosexual male cognitive abilities can be compromised by the presence of women.  There are a lot of different internet articles on it, because it's the kind of claim tailor made for clickbait.  [Here's one](http://www.scienceofrelationships.com/home/2012/7/24/hot-women-make-men-dumb-and-dumber.html).  Apparently all of these articles refer to the same two studies- [this one](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103109001164) which tracked a significant degredation in performance memory and attention tests after interacting with someone of the opposite gender for men (not women), and [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3394231/) which tracked similar results when men were told that they were just being observed by a woman over a webcam.  Most of the internet articles frame it as ""attractive"" women affecting heterosexual men, but the webcam study is significant in that there was no actual woman, attractive or otherwise, physically present.

I don't have access to the actual papers, or the background to criticize them (to the point where I rarely contribute to any of the threads discussing social science papers here)- so I thought I'd ask others more qualified than me here for their opinions on the papers.

I can imagine all sorts of uncomfortable implications that might stem from these papers being solid.  I could imagine a defense of single-sex schooling and segregated workplaces at one extreme, and male-targeted discipline training on the other extreme.  Or, most likely, scoffing and not-meing as we ignore the findings (should they be deemed compelling) and continue to ignore things that might be important to doing things like addressing the lower performance of boys in school.  I expect that some would prescribe solutions which assumed that this was a fixed, immutable, fact of biology, and others would prescribe solutions which assumed that it was all nurture- but the success rate of either approach would probably serve as testimony to which approach was correct.

If the studies reveal an uncorrectable tendency of heterosexual male psychology, what does that mean?  Would boys and men be within their rights to seek to learn and work in environments where they wouldn't be compromised?  Or would women's right to equal opportunities trump that?  It seems like an area where you might face some zero-sum gender issues, and if nothing else, it suggests a weird world for women where it would be impossible to observe men working at peak mental capacity.",jolly_mcfats,t2_5nr7p,0.81,9,60
977,7usobt,2018-02-02,FeMRADebates,I'm Hiring! Part 2.,"So resumes have come and gone, interviews have occurred, and we are down to three strong candidates, two male and one female, for my open position.  They are all very different from each other in terms of how much and what type of work experience they bring to the table, so the decision for us (well, me ultimately, but I value the input of my colleagues in the group!) is more, What skill set(s) do we value the *most?* and, How important is *junior* vs. *senior* in terms of the position..? than, Which candidate is the *best?* (they're all just right!  for different roles.)

In terms of relevance to this subreddit--I had this set of encounters, with the female candidate, that did get me thinking along gendered lines...here at my company, the hiring workflow goes resume-to-HR, HR-checks-basic-qualifications, if they pass that HR does a brief phone screen making sure that their desired salary falls within the range we're willing to offer, that they can work in the US for any employer, etc. etc. and then, if all *that's* a go, sets up a half-hour phone screen between the hiring manager (me, in this case) and the candidate.  If the hiring manager likes the candidate after the phone screen, HR brings them in for a half-day interview with up to four people or little groups of people specified by the hiring manager for the in-person interview.

About halfway through my phone screen with the female candidate, she said something--I can't remember what now, it wasn't blatant, it was subtle--but it was clear that she was a little taken aback by the fact that *I* was the hiring manager. :)  I am used to this, from everyone I communicate with first or only ever over the phone--I not only have a rather youthful voice in person, for whatever reason over the phone, it's like 10 times worse (somebody told me once that the phone cuts out the lower speech tones, I don't know if that's it)--I literally sound about 15 years old on the phone.  I laughed and reassured her that I was indeed the hiring manager and not to be fooled by my voice, that I have three children, the oldest of which is over 20 years old! I'm really a grownup, I swear. :)


So, I liked her and her qualifications, and told HR to bring her in for the formal half-day interview.  On the day, I zipped over to the assigned conference room at my assigned time, opened the door and introduced myself to the candidate, who was a nice-looking older lady in a suit (much like what I had pictured from talking to *her* over the phone, honestly).  We shook hands; her gaze swept over me, coming to rest on my face, and she said, ""You *really* have adult children?""  Then she laughed, and said, ""You must be the happiest woman in the world!"" 

I was a little taken aback (she's not American, and I suspect that that particular phrase might've been directly translated from something in her own language that sounded better, or at least *smoother,* in that language :) )  but also flattered of course--""Gee, thanks!"" and then we got down to the business at hand.   

But I thought about it again later...what if she'd been one of the *male* candidates, who had said that..?  I'd have been *very* uncomfortable--likely uncomfortable enough to nix that candidate from the mix.  And of course that made me even *more* uncomfortable--double standards, anyone..?  Though, to be fair to me, that's not *entirely* it--after all, she herself is a heterosexual woman, so there was no way that could have been any kind of sexual come-on, which is what about it would've made me uncomfortable if it had been a man, saying it.  But then--while I have no doubt that *some* men, saying that, indeed *would've* meant it as a sexual come-on (I've been the recipient of enough of them, God knows), hardly *all* men would've meant it as that (plenty of men are (a) heterosexual but not particularly attracted to me personally or (b) are homosexual, for example).  But--you can't really deduce those things from an extremely short acquaintanceship, without any context and without other obvious signals that it *is* a sexual come-on or not (like leering or smirking or God forbid, attempts at physical contact, all of which remove any element of mystery from the situation).

I suspect most men simply know not to mention their potential female manager's physical appearance at *all.*  Certainly the other male candidate who is an external candidate, didn't!  (Then the situation gets even murkier--the third candidate is actually an internal candidate and I've worked with him quite often over the course of the past five years...while he of course made no mention of how I look during the interview, over the past five years, he has managed to convey the impression that he thinks I am attractive.  But he has done so in a very mannerly way, so I've never held that against him...omg, it gets *so* complicated.)

So, lots of gendered thoughts are in my head, today.  :)  Anybody have any of their own, about all of this?  (And no, I *still* don't know who to pick.  All I can say is, gender's *not* a consideration in that choice, between these three candidates!  I know, I know, there are WAY worse problems than having too *many* promising, qualified candidates to choose from...)

979,3e51h8,2015-07-22,FeMRADebates,Why 'Jurassic World's Claire Dearing Is Actually A Feminist Hero [spoilers],"So I've seen more than a few articles trying to paint Jurassic World as sexist because of Claire's character.

The tone of those articles made it pretty clear these were people who had an agenda and were bound and determined to find sexism in the movie if they had to take the entire thing of context.

For example

> Fifteen seconds into the clip he’s taken a page out of the 1963 edition of Hack Screenwriter’s Digest and turned her business-related comment into sexual innuendo. “That’s not funny,” she responds in the most patient and reasonable tone she can muster.

Right referencing a date they had with a joke, totally inappropriate. *eyeroll* Now if they in fact had never been on a date it might seen a bit off but in actuality it's great way for the writers to introduce the character's brief history.

>“I don’t control the raptors, it’s based on mutual respect,” he says, articulating something which he clearly does not feel for her. “That’s why you and I never had a second date.”

*Exactly* The whole point of this scene is them BOTH writing the other off for being too unlike them.

>He then wanders off into this spiel about how myopic it is for her company to objectify these majestic instinct-driven beasts as “assets” before immediately driving the “instinct” part back to his apparent bitterness that she didn’t sleep with him after the first date. Clearly, she is the problem here.

Yes actually. If Claire were a man this author would be all over *his* callous disregard for the animals. But coming from a woman it's obviously justifiable and nobody has any business having an opinion.  Second if you have any social skills at all it's painfully obvious Grady is casual and fine with thing as they are, not desperately trying to get another date. Nothing could be further from either of their minds at this juncture. He isn't bitter, if anything he'd probably be ashamed if they HAD slept together at this point in the movie. It's really bizarre how this author projects completely fabricated emotions on Grady here just to demonize him.

All in all, I didn't really expect to like Claire or that her character would actually involve any reflections on sexism or feminism.

I was wrong on both counts.

http://www.bustle.com/articles/91024-why-jurassic-worlds-claire-dearing-is-actually-a-feminist-hero

Far from being a woman ridiculed for being too business like she honestly comes off more as an gender flip of the workaholic male who finds the true meaning of family. Except she actually makes this trope interesting because she actually does have the best big picture sense of the active cast and rather than some sappy revelation she merely responds normally to the situation at hand, dropping her guarded attitude and expressing concern at the loss of life happening around her.

She might be a little too rigid at times but unlike the other InGen higher-ups she tends to be clear headed. Which isn't to say she doesn't get overwhelmed, but she responds and adapts rather than panicking.

Which is really why the ""Oh Claire had to change to please others to find happiness"" argument is such a load of crap. Unlike so many Hollywood heroes neither Claire nor Owen really has some personal revelation that provide them new understanding. They learn a little more about themselves and lot more about each other but in the end Claire is who she was at the start of the movie, just rising to the occasion.",AnarchCassius,t2_hj39g,0.87,11,14

I'm not sure there is much of a debate to be had on this.  If there is one, I suppose it is this - these are all older statements.

From the article:

>Lockman has refused to respond to direct questions but released a statement, saying “I have always been passionate about my beliefs, and years ago I said things that I regret. I hold no animosity toward anyone by virtue of their gender or sexual orientation, and today I am focused on ensuring freedom and economic prosperity for all Mainers.”

My question for you is, should we even bother with this person?  Can he be redeemed?  If so, how?  If not, why not?  And how is it that this is just now coming to light?  Perhaps it is only coming to national attention and has been well known in Maine for some time.

990,6sc8ae,2017-08-08,FeMRADebates,"Diversity, affirmative action, male/female sex dimorphism: a paradox.","I was discussing this very issue with a friend recently, and, with the firing of the Google employee for his memo, I think this is currently very pertinent.

The basic idea is as follows:

1. Many, many forms of feminism and generally left-leaning ideology see diversity as a strength. It has inherent value, in itself. For the sake of this argument, when I use diversity, I will talk about sex-based diversity; the idea that having a workplace made up of relatively equal parts men and women is inherently better than a workplace made up of nearly only men (or women, but, for some reason, that rarely gets talked about).

2. Affirmative action is one of the best solutions that we currently have to make a workplace more diverse. Affirmative action allows us to get more women working in fields where the majority of the workforce are men.

3. Men and women are just as capable in terms of intellectual capacity, and are pretty interchangeable in terms of brain function/structure.

Now, as far as I can tell, we already have a core disconnect between points 1 and 3. In what way is adding women into a male-dominated workforce ""adding diversity"", if women and men have identical brains?

Either men and women are inherently different, in which case adding diversity can be seen as a possibly good thing, or they are identical, in which case diversity has no inherent value. Diversity for diversity's sake only makes sense if there are fundamental differences between the sexes.

The consensus in the fields of evolutionary biology and neurology are that there **are** inherent differences between males and females. This would indicate to me that the ""diversity"" part of the argument has value. But now it means that point 3 is wrong. This means that in some fields, there will always be imbalances in terms of sex representation.

And now we come around to my 2nd point: affirmative action. If we accept that there are inherent differences between the sexes in terms of brain function, this means that affirmative action can have a negative effect on whatever structure it is being applied to (education, the workplace, society as a whole, government, etc...). We are artificially selecting a sex based not on their ability, associated to brain function/structure, but based on their sex. What's more, we are reserving spots for a sex while the other, with a possibly more evolutionary honed brain for a certain task, is being left out to dry.

How do we reconcile these points?

Is my analysis completely wrong on this issue?

For a bit of backstory, we talked about this because we were talking about the case of trans people and gender dysphoria. My argument was that the very existence of trans people broke down some key theories in feminism, namely the interchangeability between sexes. If there is such a thing as a male/female brain, then there will be inherent differences in the representation of these sexes at different echelons in our society.",Cybugger,t2_ac17m,0.83,11,23
991,2maw83,2014-11-14,FeMRADebates,Making men more comfortable too?,"So I was reading through comments, and without getting too specific or linking to that comment, an article was referenced [talking about a t-shirt being sexist during an interview about the comet landing](http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/13/7213819/your-bowling-shirt-is-holding-back-progress).

This got me thinking a bit about how we make an effort, and is being commonly discussed, to make an environment more comfortable for women. We have situations where male-banter, particularly of a sexual nature, is discouraged or where people have lost their jobs, in an effort to make the environment less 'oppressive' or more comfortable. We have sensitivity training and so forth, so that our work environments are more inclusive and so forth.

So what can we do, what do we do, or do you think we even should make an effort to, make men feel more comfortable in their work environment? For my example, we can also make the environment a bit less gray by suggesting it is a female-dominated environment, such as nursing.

Would we want to discourage talk about children, divorce, or menstrual cycles because they may make men feel uncomfortable in their work environment? Should we include more pictures of sports cars in a nursing office so men feel more comfortable? What sort of examples could we think of that might make a man uncomfortable in his working environment, and do we think they could be worth encouraging, discouraging, warrant reprimand, or warrant employee termination?

Feel free to run this idea where you'd like, I'm just interested in some of the angles of how we might treat altering a work environment to make one group feel more comfortable, but how we may not do much for the other.

Also, to be clear, I'm not trying to make a comment on whether or not we do enough for women, etc., only thinking aloud and wondering what all of your take is on the inverse of altering a work environment to make it more inclusive and comfortable for women.",MrPoochPants,t2_8v4df,0.64,14,220
992,4uu0pr,2016-07-27,FeMRADebates,Studies on gender differences and empathy,"Seemed relevant given that it's just come to my attention that 'emotional labour' is a new buzzword within privilege theory and gender politics. 

[Are women more empathetic than men? A longitudinal study in adolescence.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19476221)

> Since the 1970s there has been a growing interest in analysing sex differences in psychological variables. Empirical studies and meta-analyses have contributed evidence on the differences between male and female individuals. More recently, the gender similarities hypothesis has supported the similarity of men and women in most psychological variables. This study contributes information on women's greater empathic disposition in comparison with men by means of a longitudinal design in an adolescent population. 505 male and female adolescents aged between 13 and 16 years were evaluated at two different moments (grade 2 and grade 3, lower secondary education). They completed the Index of Empathy for Children and Adolescents by Bryant and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index by Davis. 

> The results confirm a greater empathic response in females than in males of the same age, differences growing with age. The sizes of the effect estimated in the second evaluation (average age 14 years) are large for emotional empathy and medium for cognitive empathy.

[Sex differences in the neural basis of false-belief and pragmatic language comprehension](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25264229) 

> Increasing research evidence suggests that women are more advanced than men in pragmatic language comprehension and Theory of Mind (ToM), which is a cognitive component of empathy. 

> We measured the hemodynamic responses of men and women while they performed a second-order false-belief (FB) task and a coherent story (CS) task. During the FB condition relative to the baseline (unlinked sentences [US]), we found convergent activity in ToM network regions, such as the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) bilaterally and precuneus, in both sexes. We also found a greater activity in the left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and a greater deactivation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)/orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) bilaterally in women compared to men. However, we did not find difference in the brain activity between the sexes during the FB condition relative to the CS condition. 

> The results suggest a significant overlap between neural bases of pragmatic language comprehension and ToM in both men and women. Taken together, these results are in line with the extreme male brain (EMB) hypothesis by demonstrating sex difference in the neural basis of ToM and pragmatic language, both of which are found to be impaired in individuals with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC). In addition, the results also suggest that on average women use both cognitive empathy (dorsal mPFC) and affective empathy (vmPFC) networks more than men for false-belief reasoning.

This seems to be pretty crucial given the recent (first-world?) phenomenon of emotional labour which is, according to mainstream sources, a gender stereotype against women:

['Women are just better at this stuff': Is emotional labour feminism's next frontier?](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/08/women-gender-roles-sexism-emotional-labor-feminism)

> In all fairness, Lena’s friendly dismissal makes a strong point. The concept has been around for over 30 years; it was first introduced by Arlie Hochschild, an academic who formally coined the concept in her 1983 book The Managed Heart.

> But only recently has it slowly started to re-emerge in online debates and pop culture. Jess Zimmerman, who wrote about emotional labor for The Toast, says she was floored by the amount of feedback she received – hundreds and hundreds of women commented in fervent agreement, thanking her for finally giving them a vocabulary for what they experienced.

> Zimmerman framed emotional labor as something especially occurring in private, while academics first focused on it as a formal workplace issue. It is perhaps because more and more women are entering formerly male dominated professions that they’re noticing that extra emotional – say, “female type” – work is expected of them.

> In a work context, emotional labor refers to the expectation that a worker should manipulate either her actual feelings or the appearance of her feelings in order to satisfy the perceived requirements of her job. Emotional labor also covers the requirement that a worker should modulate her feelings in order to influence the positive experience of a client or a colleague.

> It also includes influencing office harmony, being pleasant, present but not too much, charming and tolerant and volunteering to do menial tasks (such as making coffee or printing documents).

[…]

> “The way I think of emotional labor goes as follows: there are certain jobs where it’s a requirement, where there is no training provided, and where there’s a positive bias towards certain people – women – doing it. It’s also the kind of work that is denigrated by society at large.”

> Research suggests that cumulatively, ongoing emotion work is exhausting but rarely acknowledged as a legitimate strain – and as such, is not reflected in wages.

> The growth of low-wage, service industry jobs, where “service with a smile” is an expectation, has helped further entrench the phenomenon. Here, emotional work is not an added value; it is rather a requirement to get workers to the bare minimum.

> In the US, where the federal tipped minimum wage is just $2.13 an hour, this is further accentuated. In those jobs, the employer is expecting emotional output, but is unwilling to pay for it. The duty to recognize emotion work is offloaded onto the client – who is then expectant of emotional fulfillment and satisfaction before providing the extra money.

> This has nefarious consequences, especially for women. According to a study by ROC United, a worker center representing restaurant workers, women living off tips in states that have $2.13 minimum tipped wages are twice as likely to experience sexual harassment on the job compared to women in states with higher base wages.

> Recent data suggests at least two-thirds of the low-wage industry is female, with half of these workers women of color.

> Even in more prestigious industries, Jessica Collett, a professor of sociology at the University of Notre Dame, explains, men and women may both be engaged in the same degree of emotional labor formally, but women are expected to provide extra emotional labor on the side.

> For example, boardroom members – male and female – may have to schmooze clients to the same extent (a formal expectation that goes with their jobs) but women may be expected, on top of this, to contribute to office harmony by remembering colleagues’ birthdays, or making small chit-chat to staff. Male colleagues may do this too, but if they do it will be noticed as a plus (“isn’t he sweet and generous with his time?”).

> This remark was echoed by a successful female human rights lawyer and friend of mine, who recently complained about the expectation that she should engage with office administrative staff every morning – something she was happy to do, but also felt she had to do. She needed to be seen as kind and competent in order to be respected, something her male colleague never bothered with.

> Robin Simon, a sociology professor at Wake Forest University, turned the tables on herself and said that as a female professor, she was expected to be much more emotionally aware and available in and out of the classroom than her male colleagues.

> “Students expect more emotion in women,” she says, with female professors not just expected to be chirpy in the classroom (especially with the rise in student-evaluation-related employment), but also sometimes doubling up as therapists and faculty-politics peacekeepers.",Xemnas81,t2_h5rpp,0.65,5,26
993,4rxjwl,2016-07-08,FeMRADebates,Why is police killing civilians not a gender issue as well?,"I was looking over at [The counted](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database#), a database of civilians who have been killed by police officers.  I know that black men are more likely to be killed by white men, and that's definitely reflected in the data.  But it seems that men in general are just more likely to be killed than women.

[I crunched some numbers](http://i.imgur.com/9E3ShOk.png) with the information from the report, and it seems that a white woman becoming black would increase her chances of getting killed by police by about 80%, but if she became male instead it would increase her chances of being killed 15-fold.  Although there's definitely racial effects at play, it appears that, with white and black people, the gender effect is always greater.  The increase in chances of being killed between black men and black women, and between white men and white women (24.5-file and 15.6-fold, respectively) are both larger than the increase in chance of being killed you would receive from changing from a white woman to a black woman or a white man to a black man (1.8-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively).  Any way you cut it, when looking at these two races, the effect of gender is far higher than the effect of race on what will get you killed by police.

Including other races makes things a bit more complicated.  For example, being a Native American or Hispanic man makes you more likely to be killed than a white man, but being a Native American or Hispanic woman makes you *less* likely to be killed by police than a white woman.  So it seems that racial effects are not uniform across genders.  However, the gender effect seems to be uniform across races; for each race, you are more likely to be killed as a man than you are as a woman.

So this raises the question; in all the discussions about police discrimination with regards to killing people, why is gender not a larger part of the discussion.  Clearly, there is a problem with police killing black men (the most likely to be killed group), but the data suggest that they are killing them because they are black and also killing them because they are men.

996,5e4jph,2016-11-21,FeMRADebates,Japanese salarymen and their allowance,"I stumbled on the very interesting fact that Japanese 'salarymen' typically hand over their salary to their wife, who manage the household finances. The men get only a small [allowance](http://www.japan-talk.com/jt/new/okozukai) that they can spend freely. The men live extremely regimented lives, where they are expected to work very long hours. It is often considered mandatory to go out drinking in the evenings with the boss to network. So it's not [a lot of fun](https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28111194) for men who don't like that lifestyle. Even though they often are the sole provider, the men only control a [fraction of the salary](http://www.standard.net/Business/2016/06/29/Abenomics-brings-salarymen-no-relief-as-wives-limit-allowances), set by the wife.

Similarly, Japanese women have strong gender expectations as well. They are expected to manage the household and raise the children. Part time jobs tend to be low skill and badly paid, so a well-educated Japanese woman often has to choose between a good job or raising children. There is no good option to combine the two. The result is that Japanese mothers drop out of the workforce [more than in other countries](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21599763-womens-lowly-status-japanese-workplace-has-barely-improved-decades-and-country). Other Japanese people simply choose not to have children, resulting in a very low fertility rate.

The gender norms for married people are so unpleasant to many, that there are quite a few MGTOWs and WGTOWs, called [Herbivore men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbivore_men) or [Parasite single](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_single). Others 'check out' by committing suicide. Japan has [50% more suicides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate) than the US.

We have had discussions here whether the earnings gap between men and women really means that men are better off; or whether the wife often gets to enjoy the money. I think that Japan demonstrates that very strict traditionalist gender norms can coexist with strong control by the wife over the household finances. Furthermore, a good case can be made that the male gender role is extremely oppressive in Japan, so much so that [overwork death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kar%C5%8Dshi) is a serious problem. I think that this shows that 'societal power,' which feminists often judge by who holds the most powerful jobs or who earns the household money, isn't necessarily a position of privilege.

Japan also demonstrates how gender norms for men stifle female emancipation. The extremely strict norms for providers makes it very hard for men to help with the household and children; and also make it very hard for women to get good jobs, as they are often forced to choose between a good job or raising children. By fighting male gender norms, men are freed to make choices that are more egalitarian and women get options that allow them to retain the parts of the female gender role that they like (like raising children), while also adopting some parts of the traditional male gender role. So I would argue that Japan also demonstrates why men's rights are necessary to achieve an egalitarian society.",Aapje58,t2_oziyx,0.79,19,6
997,yb8gi7,2022-10-23,FeMRADebates,"It's usually taken for granted that women are good people to ask about what women are attracted to, I think we should begin to question that.","Let me start with an anecdote.  

-

My wife's been talking since basically the day I met her about wanting a boob job. I suggested that it may not be a great idea since men put a very big premium on natural boobs, especially if they're naturally very large. Her being an escort, that matters a lot. She disagreed. We had a very long drawn out debate on the matter and it turns out she was right. We're gonna wait until after we have kids, but apparently that's gonna be the best business decision she's ever made because men are much more into fake boobs than I would have thought. 

-

In this discussion about male sexuality, being a male turns out to have given me zero actual expertise. Men are generally into boob jobs and bbls, and anyone saying otherwise has not done extensive research into the matter. Looking back on this discussion, I think I was perhaps viewing men with rose-tinted glasses. I'm shooting from the hip  here, but I'd bet that more women than men know that men are into things like boob jobs and bbls because plastic surgery is a big business. My new revised opinion is that the people who have to attract straight men know more about what straight men are attracted to than straight men do. 

-

I had a similar experience when I started taking steroids. I hear such an insane amount of women tell me about how they aren't into muscles. I started seriously trying to date once I got my squat up from untrained to 405 lbs for 5 reps. I was suddenly much more dateable. When  I met my wife, she cautioned me against getting too muscular. I had a view of what I wanted my body to look like and asked her to trust me. She was hesitant. She only really gave me the enthusiastic green light to get my squat up to six plates after my I brought her to a serious powerlifting gym and she saw what muscle looks like. 

-

So now let's get to the point...

-

Men, especially men in places like where I grew up in the North East, are really sold an image of what women want them to be. Many men who internalize these modern descriptions of what a man should be like and then grow up to be incels. When I make a claim that it's because the image boys are sold is not what women are attracted to and that we've developmentally stunted boys into growing up unfuckable, I have to debate theory. Women will  say things like, ""Why would I want to be with a man who's  like _________?"" And unfortunately, there just isn't a culturally backed and institutionalized perspective for me to draw from and so I'm left with the basic assumption that the woman I'm speaking to has some authority on the topic. 

-

At the end of the day, men and women glamorize our  own sexualities. It's kind of ugly to tell a woman, especially one who takes pride in  the size of her natural  boobs, that they'd be improved by being stuffed with silicone. It's kind of ugly to tell a man that his ideal body requires an amount of lean body mass that might not even be naturally possible. For that reason, people often go into denial about this shit and give false views as to what they're attracted to. Moreover, I've never had to  attract a man before so if my advice  sucks then I never suffer. I just look virtuous for having the right view on fake boobs. Same goes for women who give bad advice. They don't have to be incels.

-

It's a lot easier to go to someone of your own gender and ask them to reveal the dirty secrets of the other gender. This has extra salience though, because our idea of the perfect man is very ideological. There is a lot of academic theory that dissects, deconstructs, and criticizes masculinity and that denies that certain male behaviors are attractive even when we all know men who exhibit them and are great with women. Because this theory is considered to be ""Good values"" in America, we showcase it in children's television and enforce it in schools. We pat girls on the head for saying they're into it and we pat boys on  the head for saying they want to become it. And then later on in life, we call those men incels and mark them as terrorists.",BroadPoint,t2_2s4hqrtz,0.86,40,30

To start with, I want to state my intentions:
I want to have a bit of discussion on the topic of Patriarchy, and feminism in general. I find that discussing the issues helps me to better understand my own position and to come to a better, more accurate idea of reality. If you post attacking language, insult others or me, or are generally less than civil, I will not respond to you, and have no interest in talking with you on the subject. I am not completely informed on the topic of which I am discussing, and as such, I am looking for discussion to become better informed, and/or, to better inform others either of my own position, or of arguments from the counter-position[s].

I also want to say, if you want to recommend that I read [insert book], please feel free to instead summarize their ideas or thoughts. The reason for this is that there is a lot of literature on the subject, and I simply do not have the time to read anywhere near the amount of reading material that is available and interesting enough to hold my attention. I would like to have a discussion on the topic, not a reading list. Also, I'm poor, so I would likely have to find more dubious means of getting my hands on those materials or stop being lazy enough to actually go to a library. Har Har.




**I wanted to have a bit of discussion on looking at the idea of Patriarchy from a different angle.**

So first let us define Patriarchy a bit, so we have a base to start from.

per merriam-webster.com
**Patriarchy: a family, group, or government controlled by a man or a group of men**

So from this definition, we don't really get a lot of what feminists are really talking about with regards to the oppression of women, so let us look for another definition, which will serve us a bit better for the points I intend to make.

So if I, instead, Google for Patriarchy, it comes up with a few definitions, but in particular we get:
**a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it.**


So the reason I was looking for two definitions is because it is often the case that two definitions are used with a bit of equivocation. If we go with the MW definition, we're really only saying that there are people in power **and** they are usually men. If we go with the other definition, we get that there are people in power **because** they are men. So first, the biggest problem with this is largely that I feel it falls into a pit of correlation does not equal causation. I'd use the actual name of the fallacy, but its in Latin, and this is much easier to digest and understand, to me at least.

Also, regarding our second definition, there is an undercurrent and assumption that there is an intent to advantage men and oppress women. This is a common theme that I hear when discussing feminism and patriarchy, usually with feminists. Ultimately, this will be the meat of my arguments, that is, if we lived in a patriarchy we should see that men are advantaged by the patriarchy and that women are disadvantaged.

So if we then look at the issue, is it that they are in power **because** they are men, or is that simply an attribute that most people in power have? If we live in the patriarchy that excludes women we should find that women are excluded from positions of power, and thus a negative increase, or that the number of women entering those positions is relatively stagnant. For our model, we'll look at CEOs.

[Number Of Women CEOs At Major Companies Jumps By 4 Percent](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/07/08/2266831/number-of-women-ceos-at-major-companies-jumps-by-4-percent/)

So from these statistics, we can see that, while the positions in recent years have been stagnant, there has been an increase in CEOs who are women. Now this isn't a very large figure, certainly, and it doesn't really tell us a whole lot about our model. We can say that there is a small correlation to show that women are not actively being excluded, or at least, it is not as bad as it once was and is getting better. Does this completely demolish the idea of patriarchy? Of course not, so let us continue.

We have the issue of the wage gap. The traditional feminist statistic throws out that women are paid around 23 cents less than men, in equal positions, etc. This particular statistic, however, has been shown, in recently years, to be closer to about 7 cents.

[On Equal Pay Day, key facts about the gender pay gap](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/08/on-equal-pay-day-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gender-pay-gap/)

So let us look at our model, that is, that ""women are largely excluded from [power]"", or rather, that they are at a disadvantage or are oppressed. So if we were to assume the model to be correct, we would expect to see a larger gap in pay. Instead we have a fairly strong correlation to show the contrary. Now, for the record, I am not suggesting that this should not be the case, this is an improvement no doubt, but it makes me at the very least consider if we do still live in a patriarchy, as we would, again, expect to find women making less than men or making about the same as they did the year[s] prior.

We should also consider that within this statistic, there is a large amount of information suggesting that reasons for women making less money has to do with personal choices. Many times this is cited as being an issue of taking care of family or children, while men do not. Now, I believe a lot of this comes from a more evolutionary argument, that is, that them man is ultimately responsible for tending to the food, or in this case household income, and thus leaves the woman to care for the children and family. We can debate all we want about the circumstances regarding this, but I believe it has less to do with anything other than SELF-imposed gender roles. Stating that it is the patriarchy, in some way, that is dictating that seems to make the patriarchy out to be an entity all of its own, with its own agenda.

So let us also consider this idea of the wage gap. Let us assume that women do, in fact, make less than men for no other reason than their gender. If our model is correct, we should see an increase in the number of employed women versus men. If a company can pay a woman less money to do the same job, they are heavily encouraged to do so, and as such, we should see the workforce flood with women. So let us look at some statistics then...

So I have provided two links, the first is statistics from July of 2013, and the second, showing a larger time-frame for 2013. So in the first we are shown a figure around 7% unemployment for men, and 6.5% for women. Not a huge figure, mind you, so in this case we have fairly equal level of unemployment, showing a negative correlation between women getting paid less and employment. That is, if our model were correct, we should see more women working, as they are cheaper, and less men working.

If we look at the second link, it shows a broader picture and gives us an idea that women, actually, were very much less unemployed than men through much of late 2009 and late 2011. So in this case, our model fits, as we are showing that the oppression of women's wages is indicating that they are, in fact, more employable.

But here's the thing, we still have to consider who is doing the oppressing. If men, on the whole, are the ones doing the oppressing, as the general idea of patriarchy dictates, they are actively harming themselves. Being paid less money is much preferably to making no money at all. So our model, while appearing accurate, contradicts the concept of oppressing women for the sake of giving an advantage to men.

Still, this isn't especially conclusive, as it goes a bit both ways. The problem I often have with this sort of concept is that any time we have a situation that does not fit this narrative of oppressing women, but instead shows that it is oppressing men, we are still told that it is because of patriarchy. Gender roles are a good example, as the assumption is that patriarchy supports gender roles. The problem, though, is that patriarchy is supposed to inherently advantage men at the detriment to women, and not harm both. Of course, those who are more well versed in feminism and feminist theory, I'd love to hear your explanation of this, as I often find the idea troubling.

So let us, again, check our model with things like child custody. If our model works, then we should see that women do not get default child custody, as oppressing them is in the interest of the patriarchy.

[Divorce For Men: Why Women Get Child Custody More Often
](http://www.divorcenet.com/resources/divorce/for-men/divorce-for-men-why-women-get-child-custody-over-80-time)

Yet we find this to be the opposite. In this case, the woman is benefited heavily, and counters the idea of oppressing women and advantaging men. Now, the situation, as I have read, use to be that the custody of the child defaulted to the man, but has since been changed due to feminist intervention. While I agree that the default should not be the father, it also should not be the mother, but instead custody should be, by default, joint as it is ultimately in the best interest of the child to have interaction with both parents.

So what, then, does the feminist movement's intervention mean for our model? Well, we would expect to find women being impotent to change default custody, but instead, we find that not only did they remove the default going to the father, but granted it to the mother. Instead of giving equal rights to custody, we have seen that the custody, often, defaults to the mother, due to feminism's influence. This puts our model into question, again, as we find that women were not impotent to change default custody.

The article starts off, though, by stating that many states are working toward the default NOT going to the mother, and of this am I pleased.

I could go on, but I'll try to make this a bit more brief...

If our model holds, we should see that women being oppressed should result in...

* Women being drafted for military service, exclusively
* More male homeless shelters
* Rape being a case against women, automatically, and not men. Laws written in such a way to minimize rape against women, and not men. Additionally, we should erode elements of  due process for cases of men being raped by women, and in cases of false rape accusations by women
* We should see a much higher rate of workplace deaths from women
* Higher female suicide rates than men
* Domestic abuse cases that favor men

Of course every one of these examples is a complete opposite of issues that men face, but, if we were to live in a patriarchy, that oppresses women to advantage men, we should see the opposite of each of these issues.

Now, for the record, I am not saying that we live in a Matriarchy. Similarly, I am not saying that any of these issues is conclusive regarding the equality of genders, instead, I am merely stating that the idea of there being a concerted effort to oppress women, and advantage men, is clearly not the case. I would suggest, instead, that we are much closer to a state of equality with differing issues in need of discussion. Just because we have a labor gap, or because there are fewer women CEOs, does not necessarily follow that women are oppressed and men are advantaged. The correlation to men being in positions of power does not mean that this is a direct cause of the problems that women face, OR, that is has anything to do with each of those problems.

I find it patently absurd to assume that just because a man is in a position of power that he is using that power to forward men and oppress women, when in many cases, that power is used to try to attract women. If we were to take a more evolutionary eye to this idea, we'd find that men compete for these positions of power, so that they can better attract a mate.

There are other issues, elements, and problems of course, but these are just a few of which I have recently become familiar. Please let me know your thoughts and feel free to correct me on any points I might have made an error. If possible, please provide supporting evidence. Also, anecdotes are not very relevant. For every person that has an anecdote about how they were oppressed as one gender, there is someone else with an example of how they were oppressed as the other. I am not trying to diminish your individual plight, only that his does not tell us enough about the whole, sometimes we just get unlucky or have to deal with shitty people.

I'd ultimately much prefer to promote and work from a position of egalitarianism. If we assume that things are equal, and work outwards from that, we might better be able to address individual problems, rather than playing the ""who has it worse"" game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**EDIT 1**

So this is just another idea I had moments ago, that i thought might be interesting as well. One of my main beliefs in gender issues is that both genders ultimately have it relatively equal, but happen to differ in some key issues. Examples include those i listed above.

So this got me thinking. If i were to somehow make an attempt at trying to tell who had it worse, I might try to use Maslow's hierarchy of needs as a basis. So if i were to use his hierarchy and put men's issues to the test, i could come up with a couple that likely fall into the Physiological stage. We could state that men's higher suicide rates, higher workplace death rates, potential draft, and potential for going to jail on a false rape charge all fall within that category. Of the women's issues, the only ones i can think off the top of my head, presently, are those that fall into the Safety needs category, such as the wage gap. I KNOW I am missing some women's issues in this, please find me some women's needs that fit into the Physiological stage, so I might feel better about my 'relatively equal but with different issues' ideals. Similary, I am not trying, in any way, to say who has it worse, merely thinking aloud about the concept of where I might rank them, or how, perhaps, we could prioritize gender issues. Unrelated to the post, i know, but it seemed interesting to me and in the spirit of discussion.

Letter 1:

>Q. Manager asking me to translate adult films: I’m an ex-military guy using the GI Bill to attend college. I’m looking to enter the tech field and landed a great internship at a well-known tech company. During introductions, I let people know that prior to entering college, I worked in military intelligence and had learned an East Asian language as part of my job. This attracted the interest of a senior project manager in my office who is also an ex-military linguist, but who had learned a different East Asian language. We struck up a conversation, and he revealed that he was working on a “side project” that could use my language skills. Being eager to impress, I readily volunteered, and he asked me to come over to his place that evening. However, when I arrived, I was mortified to learn that his “side project” was adding English subtitles to animated porn films for some website he runs! Not wanting to lose the internship, I awkwardly translated a few lines for him, then made up some excuse to leave. Now I have an email from him asking when I am free again to help! I worry if I say no, I’ll risk upsetting somebody who could potentially sabotage my career, but I also don’t want to spend my evenings translating tentacle porn and God knows what else for this weirdo! If I were a woman, I think this would be sexual harassment, but what the hell is this if you’re a guy?

Letter 2:

>Q. Saddled into surrogacy: I was the surrogate for my twin sister after she was in a car accident that left her unable to have children. I was already married with three sons when she and her husband approached me. My husband and I agreed. I delivered my niece without any problems five years ago. I am currently pregnant with a little girl now. I was planning on having my tubes tied after this. When I told my sister and her husband this, they grew very upset. Apparently, they were counting on me to carry one more pregnancy for them. My twin even told me it wasn’t fair that I “get” four children and she “only gets the one.” It felt like a knife to the heart. I was completely blindsided. I haven’t even told my husband, because he will react with rage. I don’t know how to interact around my sister anymore. I have never had a child without her there holding my hand: She was there for my boys and there when I pushed her daughter into this world. Our mother died when we were teens. We’ve celebrated most of our major life milestones together. I feel completely alone. How do I deal with this?

Letter 3:

>Q. Be-little-ing boyfriend: I have been dating “Dan” for four years. I am three inches taller than him, and I like to wear heels. It has always been an in-joke when we go out that people think he is rich because he has a hot blonde in heels on his arm. Six months ago, Dan got sick and was laid off at work. He is better now and has a new job, but the medicine he takes made him gain weight and he is making less money than he did before. I am very thankful, because we thought the disease was initially more serious than it turned out to be. Dan is still attractive to me. He has always been witty, and his sense of humor is what made me fall in love with him, but now it has gotten very prickly. Dan puts himself down all the time and jokes about me leaving him or trading him in for a better model. Nothing I can do or say reassures him. I have tried to be more affectionate and to initiate sex, but it does not seem to help.

>Last week, we were going to a business function at my company where I was to be a featured speaker. I couldn’t find one of my high heels. Dan told me to just wear flats and I said no, I needed to wear them. Then Dan said that I liked to wear heels so I could look down at people—just like that, out of the blue. It hurt, and I told him so. Dan just walked out of the bedroom. We went to the event and came home not speaking to each other. Since then, Dan has made more cutting comments. He will not go to a counselor. I don’t know what I can do here. It is like I went to bed one night with the love of my life and woke up next to a stranger. Please help?

1000,9izm0x,2018-09-26,FeMRADebates,"Quora feminist answers ""Why is misandry okay for some feminists?"" (My response)","[Here's](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-misandry-okay-for-some-feminists/answer/Torrese-Arquee) the person's answer

The main points he makes to justify it are these:

 - ""Prejudice against a demographic is okay if members of that demographic abused someone."" For example he says

>In fact, i would argue that what some ill-informed men might call ""misandry"" is actually women who are legitimately angry about the oppression and violence inflicted upon them by men in power and men in their own lives. Not at all unreasonable.

It is unreasonable to hate men *in general* because *some* men in her life abused her 

 - ""Misandry is rare.""

>i think actual cases of ""misandry"" are very rare. When they do exist, it may be a legitimate response to male violence.

What is his metric for misandry being rare? Judging by the [amount of violence against men](http://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/data.html), the [perception of violence against men](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTheExpendableGender), the negative stereotypes against males (e.g. that men are pigs, men are dogs, men are trash, boys are stupid, boys drool, men are violent / abusive, men can't be trusted with children [either because they're pedophiles or they're incompetent], etc.), I would say misandry isn't rare at all

 - ""Males are the oppressors in power and females are the oppressed with no power."" 

It's something many people take for granted, but it's highly debatable. In terms of who generally has more power, that depends on the situation. A man may generally be taken more seriously in the workplace or politics. A woman may generally be taken more seriously where it comes to children. A man may have more credibility than a woman where it comes to explaining a computer program. A woman may have more credibility than a man where it comes to making a rape accusation, or denying a rape accusation

And often any kind of ""gender power"" is trumped by other factors. Generally a parent has power over its offspring, a teacher over a student, a supervisor over an employee, an adult over a child, etc. and any of these roles are held by either sex. For example, politicians being mostly men doesn't mean other boys or men aren't at risk of being abused by their mothers; or taken advantage of by female supervisors; or abused by their gf's / wives, having no shelters to go to, and losing custody of his children to a violent partner

>Men have the power to abuse, rape and kill women. And too often, we get away with it.

What does it even mean by ""men have *the power* to""? The physical ability? The social ability? Either way, evidently women have the power to abuse, rape, and kill men, as well, since many of them have done precisely that. And when there is someone getting away with abuse because of gender, [it's not males](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144002)

 - ""Men aren't at risk of violence by women."" 

>Men have never been threatened by women to the extent that we threaten women. Women are more at risk to be raped and killed by men than vice-versa. And the comparison is not even close

This is not even close to the truth. It's just another thing people take for granted without thorough investigation. There is evidence of symmetry in both [domestic violence]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1854883/) and [sexual violence]( https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/09/22/rape-cdc-numbers-misleading-definition-date-forced-sexual-assault-column/16007089/). Of course statistics on these issues can never be completely accurate. But considering some factors that might make these numbers flawed (underreporting, how the questions are phrased in the study, respondents not wanting to perceive themselves as victims, etc.), if anything it seems more likely the amount of female abusers is underrepresented since [people abused by women tend to have a harder time talking about it](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14533025) than people abused by men

>Women have reason to be angry (or ""hate"", if one insists) men. Men do not have any justification that is equally compelling. 

He hasn't given a compelling reason for the former. The fact that a minority of men abuse women is no more compelling of a reason for women to hate men than the fact that a minority of women abuse men is a reason for men to hate women

>Misogyny is predicated on lies and fictions about women; so-called misandry is predicated on the truth that men inflict incredible violence against women, and have done so throughout history.

Unless he actually believes no women are evil and all men are evil, he's basically interpreting the fact that a minority of women do wrong to mean ""it's a lie that women are detestable"" and interpreting the fact that a minority of men do wrong to mean ""it's a truth that men are detestable"" 

It's no more wrong for me to say ""misandry is based on false, prejudice negative stereotypes about men; so-called misogyny is based on that truth that women abuse men, rape under-aged boys, murder their children, and routinely get away with it"". And for my justification to be: most men aren't the negative stereotypes, so the basis of misandry is false; some women are abusers, so the basis of misogyny is true",HeForeverBleeds,t2_r7hjs,0.9,49,75
1001,568aja,2016-10-06,FeMRADebates,"How Parenting Became A Full-Time Job, And Why That’s Bad For Women","Some interesting snippets:

>Is the professionalization of parenting designed to push a woman back into the domestic spheres where gender normative roles insist she belongs?  

>In answering this question, it’s helpful to think about toilet scrubbing in the ‘60s. In the Feminine Mystique, Betty Friedan relays one way chemical companies marketed to the average 1960s American housewife: They encouraged her to buy a separate product for each of her household cleaning tasks. “When [a housewife] uses one product for washing clothes,” a Madison Avenue consultant wrote, “a second for dishes, a third for walls, a fourth for floors, a fifth for venetian blinds, etc., rather than all-purpose cleaner, she feels less like an unskilled laborer, more like an engineer, an expert.” In other words, in order to sell more products, corporate America elevated and “scientized” the role of housewife. They established it as a high-level profession.

>Today a giant jug of all-purpose cleaner sits beneath my sink, but the new job for which there is plenty of scientifically researched accoutrement is parenthood. Contemporary middle-class parents are juggling baby-food grinders and frozen breast milk bags, organic crib mattresses and mesh bumpers, car seat recalls and “toxic formula” headlines, infant massage manuals and Mommy-and-Me Yoga classes, Baby Einstein and Diaper Genie. They’re hearing dire predictions about the future of their children’s emotional attachments or sensory processing developments or tech-savvy, rewired brains.

>Dr. Judith Suissa, Professor of Philosophy of Education at the Institute of Education at University College London, calls this “the scientization of the parent-child relationship.” The message is so embedded in our culture that it’s hard to see: Being a mother is a job for which you must learn the science. You must have, at the ready, your metaphorical specialty cleaners. You must be armed with your organic baby food cookbook and your literacy boosting “discovery cards,” with your Brest Friend pillow and your Moby wrap and your Arm’s Reach Co-Sleeper.

>Suissa mentioned the Arm’s Reach Co-Sleeper specifically when I asked her to illustrate the ways that parenting has become “scientized.” She notes how the product declares that it “provides night-time security that benefits a growing baby’s emotional development.” This kind of language raises profit margins, of course. (According to Pamela Paul’s Parenting, Inc, the “mom market” is worth $1.7 trillion.) But it also turns the parent-child relationship into a science, one a good parent learns in order to raise the right kind of kid.

>The verb “to parent” didn’t enter the American lexicon until 1958. It’s telling that this is the only familial role to be verb-ified: although a woman would never say, “I need to daughter better,” she might say, “I’m working on my parenting.” A daughter is only something you are, but parenting is something you do. (“Mother” and “father” are also verbs, though it’s noteworthy that only one of them is a job. “Mothering a child” is a form of parenting, an all-consuming personal vocation, while “fathering a child” is a one-off event.)

>Because women still do the bulk of the childrearing, the scientization of parenting weighs most heavily on mothers. It has fueled what sociologist Sharon Hays calls “intensive mothering,” in which, as Hays writes, “the methods of appropriate child rearing are construed as child-centered, expert-guided, emotionally-absorbing, labor intensive, and financially expensive.” Intensive mothering has become the standard ideal, the paradigm of “good mothering,” against which all mothers are measured. The intensive mother is the mother who knows developmental stages and toy recalls and car seat requirements. She answers every midnight cry...She mothers so fully, so completely, that her child is sculpted into a perfectly developed human to whom only wonderful things happen, because the good mother enables only wonderful things.

>Hays found it odd that the role of motherhood has become much more labor-intensive at the very time that American women now make up over 50% of the workforce. That is, at precisely the point when women are contributing more than their male counterparts to American labor, the domestic job they are traditionally expected to do has vastly increased its demands.

>And maybe that’s the ticket, as they say. In All Joy and No Fun: The Paradox of Modern Parenting, Jennifer Senior suggests that today’s professionalization of parenting is actually a response to women’s liberation. Senior argues that there is an “enduring link,” as she puts it, between women’s increased independence and the cultural pressure for women to be “more attentive” in their mothering.

>And the more work the job of mothering takes, the less energy women have for other careers. Consider today’s widely-hailed “attachment parenting” approach. With its on-demand, all-night nursing and co-sleeping, it’s far from easy for a woman who has to get to the office come morning. A committed attachment mother I know had to forego the rules and let her son “cry it out” (an attachment parenting taboo) when she found herself so sleep-deprived that she nearly crashed her car into a truck on her way to work. “What good am I if I’m dead?” she said. It’s a compelling point, but some “professional”-level attachment mothers would have looked askance at how she chose to resolve the problem. If you can’t do both your rigorous parenting regimen and your paying job, it might be obvious to them which one should go.

1002,a5lspw,2018-12-12,FeMRADebates,I never have seen anyone offer real evidence that divorce financially impacts men more than women,"People who argue that marriage is a scam for men center on the issue of alimony and child support. Yet, they never offer any evidence of how many divorced women actually ask for or receive either of those things, ignore that men are free to sue for alimony and child support as well, and finally ignore that receiving alimony and child support requires the money and resources to get a good divorce lawyer in the first place.   


Where is this law that as soon as a man and woman are divorced, the woman gets alimony and child support? No where. The agreements of a divorce are negotiated through legal representation, something not all women have access to. And again, the law freely allows men to negotiate for these things after divorce.  


Furthermore, no one even shows the statistics on divorced party's financial status after the marriage ends.  [Research shows that women, not men, face economic struggles after divorce while men get wealthier](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/the-divorce-gap/480333/).

1004,9rv9in,2018-10-27,FeMRADebates,My sexual harassment experience,"So I was morbidly obese for a few years, but underneath I'm basically a pretty handsome guy by all reports. I certainly noticed it as a teen, when girls were nice and flirtatious with me no matter how akward I was, and no matter how much I put my foot wrong. Unfortunately I was so wound-up, uptight, paranoid and anal that I didn't see the passes made at me as passes until I got into my late teens and early 20s and started letting women in.  


I'm not a Brad Pitt or a johnny Depp, if you like,  but I am a Chris Pine, if you like, to try to put it into perspective. Enough of that soapbox. But in my mid 20s I gained kilo after kilo after kilo through working office jobs and emotional eating. I still attracted women but I didn't notice, as it is so subtle, how people change towards you when you are explicitly fat, how you are judged harder and harsher, how people smile less at you, how people lower expectations of you, how your jokes fall flatter, your witty comments are seen as acerbic, your intelligence is seen as less intelligent or simply showing-off, how you have a harder time at interviews, and on dates and by both sexes.  


Then a few years later, in my late twenties, I lost most of the weight, dressed better, dressed sharper, wore more stylish, tasteful and closer-fitting clothes. I ate better, I worked out. I always had decent arms and legs but I built a chest too, upper lower outer and inner. And the way people treated me was so different. People smiled more, indulged me more, complimented me more, let me away with more. I got promoted faster. My jokes rarely felt flat. When they almost did, girls would 'reinterpret' them to be 'fine' or give me some kind of excuse..followed with a come-on or flirty comment. Offices these days are often oestrogen intensive environments, and you can see ( I lost a lot of the weight while recovering from a complex leg break) the stunned look on women's faces, their jaw dropping. How women who found you boring, or annoying or want you to be invisible, suddenly find you curious or fun or fascinating.

  
And that's where the story comes in. I have to walk by the small accounting and personnel team to get to the water cooler and those teams are mostly women in their mid 20s to mid 30s. Some of them were previously rude or mean to me. Then they would strike up conversations with me after losing the weight. Then be flirty, make flattering comments about my looks or body..it would even go as far as making comments like 'I'm soaking wet for you ' 'jokingly'. Well that kept up until they got bored of it. Then they started whooping when I walked by (never when senior management was around). Later that evolved into more withering comments. show us that ass boy..that kinda thing.And then finally devolved into outright abuse.  


I haven't thought it bad enough to report it yet but it is starting to affect me. I take different routes to get to my office. I keep my head up high to avoid eye contact with them. I try to avoid them, especially when they are 'in a pack'. The truth is, that even when they were 'complimenting' me, it felt like I was on a knife-edge. That I could turn from mr popular into mr target at any moment, as group psychology is known to play out. Besides, the fact that all these people were neutral or negative towards me before but now that I'm slim and handsome makes even the strongest compliments ring hollow..perhaps superficially mollifying my ego but more deeply wounding my sense of self esteem.  


All of this has recently given me more perspective on the world that many women inhabit. Particularly how, regardless of individual men, the pack behaviour in workplaces can make a woman feel deprived and put-upon and depressed..regardless of how superficially 'compimentary' the treatment might be. It is, above all else, an eye-opener.

  
I know that some people are going to tell me to man-up or that women have it much worse so stop complaining but I think it is a HUMAN experience and it should be fine to express it. Also, I'm sure people will say it was not my looks or body but my 'newfound confidence' that caused people to react differently. That is a factor but I don't think it is as big as people think.Even when I felt and acted utterly unconfident in my new slim muscular handsome state, people treated me better.",damiandamage,t2_ggn57zp,0.84,32,20

If men are ""*logging 70-hour weeks*"" for their careers, they *are still criticised for not picking up half of the child care*"".

If the woman is the breadwinner in the relationship (working 70+ hours, it's not an issue).

I have seen numerous arguments that even if the breadwinner in the relationship is *male* (working 60+ hours per week), they still need to at least 50% of the child care.

In this case, even though the breadwinner is *female* (working stupid hours), if the *male partner* asks for help (even 50/50) he is a slacker.

A court in India has ordered a man to undergo an  assisted reproductive technology (ART)  consultation to conceive another child with his estranged wife. If he refuses consent to the ART, ""he may expose himself to the legal and logical consequences which may follow.” The judge in her reasoning noted that India was a ""patriarchal society"" and ""the majority of women lack the decision-making power"" so apparently to overcome this, she has ruled that the woman ""has a right to reproduce and that she is entitled to exercise it” and has ordered the man undergo the ART consultation.

While he is making these threats, no one on the train is intervening. The man eventually makes due on his threats, and attacks her. Once the attack is underway, bystanders finally come in and stop the assault. 

This is what an objective, un-biased, non-politicized write up would look like for this story, but this woman and these three websites  tried to editorialized the events to shame these two random arbitrary white men more than the actual attacker (which some people are saying was an Asian man, but these three articles conveniently leave out that detail).

Out of all the people on that train that didn't initially intervene, of all the women and men, of all the different ethnicities, why are they singling out these two random ""middle class"" ""white"" ""men""?

And why did she assume they were middle class, as if only middle class men wear blazers and dress pants?

And how does she even know if they're actually white? They could be mixed.

And why didn't she try to see it from their point of view? The two men were allegedly in their 50's, so maybe they weren't confident in their physical ability to arrest a six foot mentally-ill (homeless?) man. I've also heard that the UK has some problems in regards to bystander assistance. Something about the fear of legal retaliation.

>Considerable research suggests that when women act assertively and self-promote in the workplace, they are commonly penalized by others.

>But does that perception change when a woman stands up for others?

>The study, “Leadership Over-Emergence in Self-Managing Teams: The Role of Gender and Countervailing Biases” found that when women engage in “agentic” or assertive behaviors in a team atmosphere, they are credited more for their leadership than men who carry out similar actions.

>“When women’s assertive or take-charge initiatives are in the service of a team, they not only are accepted but make a greater impression than similar endeavors by men,” Lanaj said. “That may not be commensurate with the resentment we encounter from self-promotion, but it strikes me as significantly enhancing prospects for greater female organizational leadership.”

>Why were women celebrated for their assertiveness in these situations? Lanaj offers that men are usually associated with these “agentic” behaviors so when women display them, they are more impactful.

>Said Lanaj: “Given the considerable research that finds women are penalized more than men for asserting themselves, it seems fairly clear that we are disadvantaged in that way, particularly when self-assertion is on behalf of our individual self-interest. What our study adds to the mix is the insight that, when women’s assertive or take-charge initiatives are in the service of a team, they are not only accepted but make a greater impression than similar endeavors by men. That may not be commensurate with the resentment we encounter from self-promotion, but it strikes me as a significantly enhancing prospects for greater female organizational leadership.”

>However, Lanaj warns that women simply displaying more “agentic” behavior will not erase the existing gender bias. A fundamental shift in how effective leadership is judged—both agentic and social—is necessary for true change.

What I thought was interesting was they made the distinction between a woman displaying agentic behavior in support of a team vs. displaying agentic behavior in support of themselves. What do you make of the study?",tbri,t2_fx23z,0.59,3,36
1011,20gwh8,2014-03-15,FeMRADebates,[Opinions] I'm a better man/woman than you. Tell me why.,"I want to first thank FEMMechEng for helping me hammer this topic out.

Pretend for a moment that every ideal you have for your own gender - your own identity - and imagine that I do it better than you.

Tell me what it is that I do better than you.  Define for me what your gender ideals for you are.  

We are not looking for generic ""every individual defines for themselves what their gender means to them"" - we already know this!  We are interested in your very personal, subjective and intimate definition of your ideal gender identity.  Thanks for participating!

While discussing this topic, we had a hard time defining our own ideal gender identities.  Each of our perspectives came up with very limited in scope blurbs, which are as follows:

* ""My ideal male gender identity would be to reconcile my masculinity with my sensitivity, which vary at times between each other""

* ""While thinking about what it means to be a woman (that is, a good woman), I realized that all the ideals I imagined were simply what it meant to be a good person, but I thought of those ideals while thinking of a woman. I immediately thought of what I considered the definition of a man to be, and realized that I thought of the same ideals. For some reason, my definition didn't change, it was simply the framework in which I understood those ideals that changed. Because of that, I don't really have a good definition.""",KRosen333,t2_6hvx6,0.76,4,93
1012,8ysqak,2018-07-14,FeMRADebates,The problem with the concept of Toxic Masculinity,"As a commonplace, Toxicity is fine. It is not very precise of course, it's just like blah blah dislike. It is a judgment. The origin of the notion comes from business psychology and the idea that some personalities make the entire workplace more unpleasant. That is fine of course though again, quite subjective. It quickly got taken up into pop psychology and eventually made its way into Sociology and Women's studies not to mention academic feminism and ultimately liberal rhetoric.  


But again, it is not very precise. There are people who have attempted to coin toxic femininity though personally I don't think that move works very well. Men have been saddled with (and sought out) doing the dirty work and being the more brutal gender and it just is not the case that women have had this role to the same extent. Which, is, incidentally all part of female-infantilisation.  


There is, in my view, a baldness paradox here. I don't think it is very easy to demarcate when a traditionally masculine behaviour crosses over into being a 'toxic' behaviour. This also allows very easy motte-and-baileying. One can complain all day about traditional masculinty under the rubric of toxic masculinity and when questioned say 'Oh I dont mean GOOD HEALTHY masculinity...only TOXIC masculinity'. It is an insincere move. Of course, healthy is another metaphor that is not taken literally.   


One ought to consider here, the work of the anthropologist Mary Douglas, the foremost theoretician of the sacred/profane  clean/dirty and other such dyads in human cultures. Douglas believed that when shifts are happening in society groups of people get labelled contaminatory or posionous or sick or diseased as opposed to their opposites which ward off the same. The important point is not the empirical qualities of the people so identified, but rather that 

Societal shifts demand stigmatisation and rebranding of identities. You can see this easily say with extreme rightists who can describe poor people (or Jews) as insects, vermin, dirty and what not. It is mind bogglingly obvious that 'toxicity' and 'health' fit into this pattern in how they are deployed in the gender wars.  


It would also be foolish to ignore the ways in which the western bourgeoisie wants to re-erect walls around itself post - 2008 crisis. Remember that video, ten hours walking in new york? That was an ostensibly middle-class woman being approached by loitering men, mostly minorities, who likely have no jobs and little in the way of assets. In fact there is a direct  correlation between the rise of panic (moral panic) about 'toxic masculinity' and the biggest increase in unemployed  low-status males in recent history. The rape hysteria of the 1980s and the resurgent pop-feminism of the 1980s ALSO was coterminous with large layoffs for ordinary men. ",damiandamage,t2_ggn57zp,0.84,21,5

Howard relates to his Domestic Violence counseling group (lead by Ms. Pitts) his story.

Howard returns from his father's funeral to find his wife of 16 years has stolen his money, stashed their kids with her mother, and run off with Howard's business partner who has stolen their joint business. When he confronts her, she insults him and he loses control and breaks her nose. 

> ""... all I could do was ask her why. Why had she done this? She told me it was because I was a loser. She told me she was a woman with needs and that I never, from the day we were married, met them. She told me the kids would be better off without me and that any more contact with her or them would have to be through a lawyer."" [...]

> ""She told me that she would kiss me goodbye but she didn't think I'd like the taste of another man's cock on her lips.""

> A single tear slid from Howard's eye and tracked down his cheek. 

> ""I lost it,"" he said, clinching his hand into a fist and beating it against his knee. ""I punched her in the face and broke her nose. Of course I went to jail and that's how I ended up here, as your new assignment, Ms. Pitts. Another statistic of domestic violence."" Tobi saw her opening and took it. She spoke in a soft, rehearsed whisper, beaconing Howard to consider her question.

> ""Are you saying she deserved a broken nose, Howard?""

> Howard seemed to think for a moment and then replied.

> ""No, Ms. Pitts. I am saying she deserved the ass-kicking of a lifetime."" The entire room took on life as the men shifted around in their chairs. One of them muttered, ""Fucking A, right,"" under his breath but it was heard by all. 

At this point the counselor's confidence is shaken. The story ends as he recalls his daughter, on the phone:

1014,57max5,2016-10-15,FeMRADebates,How Being Ugly Discredits a Woman,"This is a dynamic that I noticed way, way back, probably as far back as adolescence--basically, if you want to be a woman who discusses gender rights and issues from any kind of feminist perspective, it's really better for you, and your argument, if you're attractive.  It's a very common tactic for opponents to dismiss you and anything you have to say on the subject, with *you're just bitter because YOU'RE FAT or UGLY and NO MAN WANTS YOU because if they did, you wouldn't BE like this!*

I've twisted that around to my own, feminist advantage, I'll admit it.  Generally, one look at me has always been sufficient to convince anyone that whatever my reasons for being feminist are, they *aren't* that I'm too ugly to catch a man and therefore am determined to wreak my rageful vengeance on all those unappreciative, superficial sonofabitches who've rejected me--!  Nor is it that I've *missed out on the perks of BEING a woman--I mean, being a beautiful woman is so GREAT, men will just FALL ALL OVER THEMSELVES to give you whatever you want and if you'd just ever HAD that you'd KNOW that women are REALLY the ones with all the power!* ...well, clearly, I have had that, and as it turns out, that's not really the final, unanswerable argument to women's gender-related issues. :)  Besides the fact that most women are *not* beautiful (obviously--most women are within a few standard deviations of *average* on the attractiveness curve, just like most men are), even if you *are* beautiful--unless your lifelong desire is to be some version of a decorative object, it really isn't the answer either.

One reason many women *are* shy and hesitant to come forward about a sexual harassment or even assault claim, especially when the perpetrator is a man of wealth, fame and/or stature, is, unless they're *beautiful enough to tempt such a man!*... they *are* afraid no one will believe them.  Which of course, is a stupid argument--rape victims, for example, range in age from infant to septuagenarian--clearly, the motives that harassers and assaulters have, while they *can* encompass the sexual appeal of their victim--they obviously don't *have* to.  There are many, many reasons harassment and assault occur, and that is only one of them.  

But it certainly works as a deterrent, attacking women for not being attractive.  And [Trump is doing his best to milk that dynamic for all it's worth](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-belittles-accusers-as-unattractive-as-more-come-forward/2016/10/14/694fd214-923b-11e6-9c52-0b10449e33c4_story.html)...though I suspect it won't be enough, not this time, and happily, not this day and age--I think we *have* moved past that set of blinkers, at least a little bit, in 2016 America.

1016,6xtf4b,2017-09-03,FeMRADebates,Domestic violence in Sports: Ezekiel Elliott and the NFL,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned this on this sub yet; I think it's a perfect microcosm of a lot of issues we discuss: domestic violence, the court of public opinion, feminism, ""listen and believe"" (I only put it in quotes because I don't know if it has an official name), due process rights as well as many others.

First of all, I'm on my phone on the train so this post won't include all the links I have to share on the subject, but if you Google ""Zeke tiffany Thompson,"" I'm sure you'll get a whole host of articles and pieces on this topic. That being said, the basics of the situation go something like this.

Ezekiel Elliott (""Zeke"") and Tiffany Thompson (""TT"") were in a relationship before the NFL Draft of 2016. He leaves her before it occurs due to her threatening to ruin his career by accusing him of domestic violence. She then accuses him of that crime, but the police and court system clears his name of all wrongdoing. The NFL catches wind, and proceeds to suspend him for 6 games out of a 16 game season during the offseason. They did so knowing of both the police's and court's decisions. Zeke appeals the suspension, saying the NFL has no proof of such action occurring. Since then, a fair amount of previously unreleased evidence seems to clear Zeke of all wrondoing, but as of this moment, the NFL stands by their decision, which was that Zeke probably brought violence upon TT.

Long winded, I know. But there are a few major points that I want to bring up:

1. Should a private entity like the NFL be able to act ""extrajudiciously"" if they believe a crime has been committed?

2. Should we believe TT by all means, given that she is one woman going up against a legal powerhouse in Zeke's laywers? This seems to be yet another story in the long book of women accusing powerful men of wrongdoing.

3. If Zeke is cleared and his suspension lifted, does this have a chilling effect on women who might rightfully accuse a powerful man of committing an act of violence?

4. If TT is lying or deliberately twisting the truth, what does this say about battered women who want to bring forth an accusation but know they have no legal resources to do so?

5. Should this even be a public spectacle, or should it take place behind closed doors? No matter which way you look at it, the reputation of everyone involved has taken a hit. Zeke is now known as a man who, at best, maybe committed domestic violence. The NFL is an organization that both allowed an abuser into its ranks, and potentially bungled it's case toward that abuser: if he is guilty, he only gets 6 games, and if he's innocent, he got 6 games. TT is known as a feminist champion bringing the fight to power-abusing men, or she is yet another liar, making it hard for women everywhere.

This shares a parallel with the current administration's stance on sexual assault in higher education. A lot of these colleges are private entities enacting their own justice on students without a standard of clear and convincing evidence. They allow the accused's reputation to be irrevocably tarnished by the court of public opinion instead of keeping their deliberations private. 

But, in some ways, these colleges and organizations must take a hard line stance. If a woman accuses your CEO of rape or DV, it's bad for business. You have to do something or risk hurting your bottom line. And not only that, but now your company will be publicly attacked for harboring an abuser/rapist, despite clear evidence of any wrongdoing. 

It's a tricky situation.

1017,2wfqdd,2015-02-19,FeMRADebates,How do we all feel about trans man-to-woman competing in sports? What about UFC in particular?,"So I was listening to an older Joe Rogan podcast, with Bill Burr [my favorite comedian], and they got onto the topic of how they feel about trans man-to-woman individuals competing in something like UFC.

They were basically saying that because of the inherent biological differences, like shoulder and hip structure, that it might not be fair. They also mentioned things like reaction times, and that muscle mass and bone mass might play a factor. They additionally mentioned an example of a tennis player who had a sex change and went from being a mediocre tennis player to dominating after the sex change.

So how do you all feel about a man having a sex change, and then going into a sports arena to compete against other women? What about the inclusion of UFC? How do we all feel about a man having a reassignment, and then going on to beat the hell out of other women in a ring? Is it fair?

1018,429w7a,2016-01-23,FeMRADebates,What is a Woman?,"This may sound like a silly question, but if you accept feminist definitions of things (and the generally accepted definitions of liberals, progressives, and even MRAs), I think the term is in need of discussion.

*You can replace the word Woman with Man though this argument, and the point stands, I'm just using Woman so I can write without endless ""he/she"" or ""man/woman""'s*.

So what's a woman? Our glossary just says it's someone who identifies as a woman, but what does identifying as a woman mean?

* Do all women have long hair? No.
* Are all women shorter than men? No.
* Do all women have high-pitched voices? No.
* Have breasts? No.
* Have overies? No.
* Have an xx chromosome? No, that'd be trans-misogynistic.


So what does being a woman mean? If I am a man, and you are a woman, what is the difference other than what we call ourselves? Why do we call ourselves different things? It seems to me that 'woman' is a completely worthless word, yet all feminists are happy to use it, it seems. The entire conversation about gender is pointless.

The only way I can see of defining 'woman' is to say that gender doesn't exist, and it's just chromosomes — women are people with xx, men are people with xy; or gender is a spectrum where Nigella Lawson is *more* of a woman than Keira Knightley, who is more of a woman than Karen Straughan, who is more of a woman than Caitlyn Jenner. That femininity is a series of secondary sex traits that aren't inherently tied to chromosomes, and if you have all of them you are more womanly than someone who has fewer (genderqueer people have a somewhat equal amount of each sex traits and therefore don't identify with either label).

I don't think feminists want to accept either. The first is too prescriptive, and the latter accepts social norms and creates a hierarchy. Feminists want Caitlyn Jenner to be as much of a woman as Meryl Streep — I can't see how that can be logically consistent.

As far as I can tell, feminists think saying 'gender is a social construct' settles the matter, but then go on and use gendered language anyway. Either we should think that gender is a destructive social construct and boycott the use of any gendered language at all, or we need to define what the hell they mean when we say 'women'.",Dack105,t2_bafgq,0.67,5,39

Below, is my perspective as a feminist and former female athlete. Thoughts?","Link: [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-21/new-zealand-transgender-weightlifter-hubbard-named-for-tokyo/100230064](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-21/new-zealand-transgender-weightlifter-hubbard-named-for-tokyo/100230064)

To outline my own thoughts on the matter:

On balance, I'm against her participation. I was/am a female athlete, and while I trained with, competed against, and beat plenty of male athletes, it was clear why we had our own competitions. While Laurel has the appropriate testosterone levels, it concerns me that she is competing with several other advantages such as increased bone density, increased hand/foot size, increased height, all from her time pre-transition. It also concerns me that she competed in men's weightlifting comps up until transitioning, meaning she was building muscle mass as a man for decades. I think if someone transitions pre-puberty, they should be allowed in, but not someone who transitions in their 30s.

At the same time, as a feminist,  I am always resentful of these sort of articles, simply because of the sheer amounts of transphobia and misogyny that accompany them. Every time this comes up, I see a few disappointing and predictable responses:

1. People that misgender and are unbelievably rude to the athlete. They call her ""he"" or ""that man"". As far as I'm concerned, Laurel Hubbard is a woman and can still be a woman, but a woman who is ineligible for competition. I will never understand why people feel the need to invalidate this woman's entire gender identity simply because of the Olympics. It's very hard to stay on the ""exclude her"" side when the other people on that side use transphobic insults.
2. Far too often, the people the angriest about trans women's participation in the Olympics/sports do not support women's sports, and call them inferior. Women's sports are not inferior and, if anything, female athletes need to overcome a much more significant biological handicap to achieve what we do. I will say it is frustrating beyond belief to see women and women's sports only being defended in light of transgender athletes rather than actual support.

With all that said, what is the solution? My initial thought would be to only allow trans women in women's sports who have transitioned pre-puberty. However, this does raise the issue that numerous areas do not allow pre-puberty transitions. Another option would be to create trans specific/open leagues or to only allow trans athletes in non competitive sports (i.e. fun runs, intramural leagues).

What does everyone think?

**Edit: For transparency, I want to stress that I am not, nor was I ever a professional or even Division 1 college athlete.** I did high school sports, club sports in college (this is different from intramural in that it functions more like a real sports team rather than just people screwing around), and local age-group races. I mentioned my background to highlight that I've actually trained with both men and women in an environment that had high stakes *to me,* and that I've actually played sports. I don't want to mislead anyone into thinking I am/was anywhere near the Olympic level, but more that I'm not a keyboard warrior who's never played a sport before.

The central figures in the controversy are [Christine Sprankle](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Christine_Sprankle) and [Jeremy Hambly](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/jeremy-hambly-magic-the-gathering-harassment-ban) (there arent any really any unbiased sources for them). The controversy revolves around a few central points. Sprankle being promoted by WotC (involving being used in marketing materials for tournaments) without any real compensation while and (remember even though many adults play MtG it is a game that has many young, its advertised for 13+ players) her posting lingerie and more explicit content in her patron. If I am to steel man Hambly's position this promotion and her behavior when directed at young boys who especially at that time (again remember this is well before huge pop culture icons like Post Malone spent 2 million dollars on a MtG card and a live play twitch stream got an Amazon show deal) were uniquely marginalized and vulnerable to an attractive woman who seemed to have a willingness to engage with fans. Looking at today with discussions around OF which at least has some limitations on spending and the vail of this is transactional gfe (similar to a strip club) this all happend before these cultures were known and aimed at young disenfranchised boys who have little social understanding or interactions. I want to explicitly say none of the harassment or hate she got was justified and the discussion that happened should have been how to best ensure the young boys were protected while the adults were allowed engage in any way they wished. 

Along the same lines of existing community's. 

Over the following years WotC has made many changes to increase diversity and sensitivity, most recently changing the Tribal (in card and marketing) to Typel as ""tribal"" was deemed offensive. The logic behind that escapes me as tribe isnt ethnically anything and tribalism is most often used for political commentary. There have been many more but i wont go through listing them. 

This is a synergy between commercialism and ""wokeness"" that many ""woke"" people refuse to acknowledge and shows how they are in fact the group in power. For as much as they complain about pink washing (supporting pride in only the most superficial and safe ways in only places they can do so without lossing market share, <cough the middle east cough>,) the fact is these companies will happly sacrifice a portion of the existing base to potentially bring in more customers. Thats good, companies should only care about expanding their customer base. The problem is the ""woke"" who claim to champion under represented and marginalized groups. The people who played D&D or MtG in the time before ""nerd culture"" became main stream was filled with nerodivergent socially isolated and often ostracized young boys. These places became the only safe space for them. People will often deride gatekeeping but it does have an important and justified reason when done correctly. The original base of players were fine with anyone joining *as long as they were there for the right reasons and had the same love of the activity* and while some absolutely used it for malicious reasons that is true of any community. 

Ultimately I think the ""woke"" activists have the responsibility to ensure that when they push for inclusion they do so in a manner that doesn't attack or further marginalize the groups already invested and enjoying the hobby. I think they have done a poor job of target assessment in many spaces with existing marginalized groups because those groups are perceived to be white cis men while ignoring all the aspects that make them marginalized groups. Depression and mental health disorders are rampant in these communities, often these are the only places they feel safe and accepted, yet because they are perceived to be ""white cis men"" it is fine to attack and forcibly change their spaces. I say perceived because often members like myself are ignored by these ""woke"" activists and shunned by our own communities for enjoying ""white people shit"". The people like me are kept even more under the rader not because of the white people who were already in these communities but by the members of our communities that deride anything to do with white people. Ultimately i think this is where those activists should be pushing. They should strive to not have companies force their change but get the customer base to change by getting minority groups to stop policing our own from enjoying ""wps"" and promoting the idea that enjoying other things the majority group enjoys doesnt mean we are losing our culture but rather adding to it.

These are just some idol thoughts that bounced around my head on the drive to work but im curious what you think? Is any of this valid? Where am i wrong or what should i consider changing? What did i get right and how would i best expand on it?",Present-Afternoon-70,t2_3vqhuobvy,0.81,6,18
1024,kueqij,2021-01-10,FeMRADebates,"Women were not, on a large scale, historically oppressed by virtue of their gender.","This has been a topic of recent discussion. The idea is that historically, there has been a patriarchy. Women were considered less than legal people, they faced violence and rape and MRAs are refusing to have an accurate view of history, denying the past as a holocaust denier might deny the slaughter of Jews. 

This long term generational violence has cast a terrible shadow over women and until MRAs accept that they will never be able to cooperate.

Anyway, I come with the happy news that in most societies this wasn't actually true, and is a myth.

The idea of coverture and such was spread by Sir William Blackstone. It has been fully debunked. 

This has long been an issue of contention for historians. Quoting Mary Beard, feminist historian and suffragette, 

https://www.marxists.org/archive/beard/woman-force/index.htm

>If one works backward in history hunting for the origin of this idea, one encounters, near the middle of the nineteenth century, two illuminating facts: (1) the idea was first given its most complete and categorical form by American women who were in rebellion against what they regarded as restraints on their liberty; (2) the authority whom they most commonly cited in support of systematic presentations of the idea was Sir William Blackstone, author of Commentaries on the Laws of England – the laws of the mother country adopted in part by her offspring in the new world (see below, Chapter V). The first volume of this work appeared in 1765 and the passage from that volume which was used with unfailing reiteration by insurgent women in America was taken from Blackstone’s chapter entitled “Of Husband and Wife.”..

>Since such were the rights of women in Equity as things stood in 1836, fortified by a long line of precedents stretching back through the centuries, it seems perfectly plain that the dogma of woman’s complete historic subjection to man must be rated as one of the most fantastic myths ever created by the human mind.

This an important issue today, when power among middle eastern societies is mostly ignored because it's not as formal and open as men's power.

Women could lead armies, own businesses, were entitled to half of property, men weren't allowed to beat their wives, women could divorce, women had dowerages which worked essentially like alimony today, women received the right to vote shortly after men without being required to fight and die for their country.

On a particular issue, one of the husband owning the property, this book gives more details.

https://books.google.com.my/books?id=AfFBAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false


>""Courts of Equity for many purposes treat the husband and wife as the civil law treats them, as distinct persons, capable (in a limited sense) of contracting with each other, of suing each other, and of having separate estates, debts, and interests. A wife may in a Court of Equity sue her husband and be sued by him. And in cases respecting her separate estate, she may also be sued without him, although he is ordinarily required to be joined, for the sake of conformity to the rule of law, as a nominal party whenever he is within the jurisdiction of the court and can be made a party.""

They could even own property separately. 

>""Courts of Equity have, for a great length of time, admitted the doctrine, that a married woman is capable of taking real and personal estate to her separate and exclusive use; and that she has also an incidental power to dispose of it.""

In fact, the law often benefited women in this place.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sketches-disposition-accomplishments-employments-importance/dp/1140792164

>“It is no uncommon thing, in the present times, for the matrimonial bargain to be made so as that the wife shall retain the sole and absolute power of her own fortune, in the same manner as if she were not married. But what is more inequitable, the husband is liable to pay all the debts which his wife thinks proper to burden him with, even though she have abundance of her own to answer that purpose. He is also obliged to maintain her, though her circumstances be more opulent than his.”

If you look at historical records of trade, there are women's names in every profession. Women could and did enter many trades, and had opportunities to work at many a job. 

On the subject of armies, Jean A Truax in Anglo-Norman Women at War: Valiant Soldiers, Prudent Strategists or Charismatic Leaders? she notes it was routine for women to be expected to command armies. A quote from one account. 

>...kept sleepless watch; every night she put on a hauberk like a soldier and, carrying a rod in her hand, mounted on to the battlements, patrolled the circuit of the walls, kept the guards on the alert, and encouraged everyone with good counsel to be on the alert for the enemy’s stratagems.

In terms of why women were not routinely in large armies, it's because recruiters didn't want them. They wanted to protect women and keep them safe at home. They forcefully conscripted men instead.

That said, in militias and sieges it was common to recruit women, as they would be close to their home. 

Women were not actually required to stay off the battlefield. If you could personally buy a horse, sword, and equipment, you could probably fight in many a war. From the fourth crusade, say, Nicetas Choniates said. 

>Females were numbered among them, riding horseback in the manner of men, not on coverlets side-saddle but unashamedly astride, and bearing lances and weapons as men do; dressed in masculine garb, they conveyed a wholly martial appearance, more mannish than the Amazons.

 Matilda of Tuscany was known to routinely charge in on horseback with her knights, and had many great successes in battle. She was famous for defeating the Holy Roman Empire on behalf of the pope and forcing him to walk barefoot through snow in apology. 

On the issue of marital rape, this was certainly an issue for both genders. There was an expectation of sex in marriage, and if you failed to perform, you could be divorced. That said, it was illegal to assault your partner, so you could resist certainly.

This was often enforced by the state.

The Lamentations of Little Matheus.

>""My wife wants it, but I can’t. She petitions for her right. I say no. I just can’t pay.""

>""Even given his sexual incapacity, Matheolus was subject to corporal punishment:

>""Acting as her own advocate, Petra [his wife] puts forward the law that if a shriveled purse [scrotum] can’t pay because it’s empty, under statute recompense for that injury is corporal punishment.""

Men and women both had the right to have their partner beaten by the law if they refused sex, and this was a right both men and women took up, though women more than men from what I have seen of records. 

Anyway, a final quote, to show how men viewed women having great accomplishments from the first woman doctor.


>""The behaviour of the medical class during the two years that I was with them was admirable. It was that of true Christian gentlemen. I learned later that some of them had been inclined to think my application for admission a hoax, perpetrated at their expense by a rival college. But when the bona-fide student actually appeared they gave her a manly welcome, and fulfilled to the letter the promise contained in their invitation.""

>""The admission of a woman for the first time to a complete medical education and full equality in the privileges and the responsibilities of the profession produced a widespread effect in America. The public press very generally recorded the event, and expressed a favourable opinion of it. Even in Europe some notice of it was taken, and 'Punch' showed his cordial appreciation by his amusing but friendly verses.""

This has been my experience in the modern day. When women seek the same accomplishments and achievements as men, they receive praise and warm hearts for their hard efforts.

So, there is no need to feel a historical pain over this. Women did in some cultures face special oppression from the rich, but for the most part, men and women worked together for common causes and were open to women having many positive paths forward.",Nepene,t2_95wvu,0.78,66,78

Quotes of note:

I admit, I'm not exactly perishing of sympathy in general for Ashley Madison users, but there's still something extremely cold-blooded about their *actual* business model, something a little more evil than just the skankiness of their *supposed* one.

Some excerpts:

>Yesterday I published the results of my analysis of the Ashley Madison member database, which contained 37 million profiles of people seeking discreet affairs. What I discovered was that, at most, about 12 thousand of these profiles seemed to belong to women who were active on the site. The rest of the 5.5 million women had profiles that appeared to have been abandoned directly after they were created.


>In the data dump of Ashley Madison’s internal emails, I found ample evidence that the company was actively paying people to create fake profiles. Sometimes they outsourced to companies who build fake profiles, like the ones Caitlin Dewey wrote about this week in the Washington Post. But many appear to have been generated by people working for Ashley Madison. The company even had a shorthand for these fake profiles—“angels.” Perhaps this is a tip of the hat to Victoria’s Secret models, also known as angels.

>An email chain between Sandra Simpson and an employee named Eduardo Borges, dated July 30, 2012, suggests that quality control on the angel profiles was actually pretty rigorous. Borges asks whether it’s OK to reuse photos if they are in different states, and Simpson says no—she notes that many members travel and they might spot the duplicates. 

>A lot of lingering questions remain, but a major one is whether the site was deliberately conceived as a honeypot to snare men, or if it grew into that by the time these emails were sent in 2012 and 2013. Biderman, who created the site in 2001, said in an interview with Bloomberg News that Ashley Madison was focused on attracting women, not men. Ashley Madison is what Biderman calls a “female-focused brand.” Everything from the site’s girly colors to the name is meant to entice those elusive XX chromosomes.

>Just looking at Ashley Madison advertisements, it’s unclear how exactly he tried to target women. All the ads are aimed at men, and many depict wives as repulsive and terrifying. 

>Plus, it’s kind of a pain in the ass to create an account on Ashley Madison if you’re a woman. When I was researching this article, I opened several fake Ashley Madison accounts — one male, and two female (one straight; one bi). I posted fake pictures and information in all three. But within seconds, my fake picture and self-description were erased from the straight female account, and when I tried to replace them I was told they would be posted later, “pending approval.” Meanwhile, my fake male picture and profile remained undisturbed — it even attracted two robo-emails from women who “indicated they are interested in someone like you.”

>Instead of looking at Ashley Madison as a dating site, I think it’s more accurate to call it an anti-community—a hugely popular social site where it’s impossible to be social, because the men can’t talk to each other, most of the women are fake, and the only interaction available is with credit card payments.

I'll let the article speak for itself. What do you think of this trio using a female pseudonym and then accepting such a hefty award? Is it an example of positive masculinity, a collaboration of friends sharing credit for a constructive enterprise? Is it feminist for centering strong female characters or anti feminist for exploiting people's sympathy for women (and for the particular woman they invented)?

1029,7w6xpc,2018-02-08,FeMRADebates,"Benevolent Sexism, Part 2","So, I've never forgotten this episode--it was the first time in my adult life that I explicitly encountered ""benevolent sexism"" in the workplace.  (My 18th birthday was only a few months past, so you see, it didn't take me too *long* into adulthood to encounter it. :) )  It definitely stuck with me, though, even 20 years on down the road--I remember it.

I was in an Army Basic training platoon--at that time, Army Basic training was still sex-segregated (for the trainees--the drill sergeants were mixed-gender).  My platoon had four drill sergeants--we'll call them Platoon Sergeant, Sergeant Artillery, Sergeant Female and Sergeant Airborne.  This story relates to Sergeant Airborne.

Up until The Incident, which occurred about 3/4 of the way through Basic training, I had thought that Sergeant Airborne liked me, as much as he noticed me at all (I thought not much) and as much as he was capable of liking any female trainee (I thought not much).  He had congratulated me for *not* having to go to Remedial PT (everyone who failed the first PT test, did--that was 56 out of the 60 total trainees)--he was my tester for the pushup portion and yelled out ""DAMN, how'd you get that many pushups out of those skinny arms of yours, Private?"" When Sergeant Female decided to shuffle up our assignments as squad leaders because, she said, she wanted more people to ""get the experience,"" he got so exasperated by my replacement that I only actually got to have a break from the job for about a day and a half before he reinstated me personally.  There were a few other episodes, no biggies but as I said, I thought that as much as he considered my existence ever as an individual person, he liked me okay.  

So one day, I was waiting for my turn on the firing range--I was sitting down with my weapon spread out in pieces around me, meticulously cleaning each one (you had to at least *look* busy, *not* like you were RESTING or something, God forbid!  and there was a lot of sand out on the ranges so we did spend a fair amount of time cleaning it out of our M16s).  He was around--I don't remember why or how, I don't think he just *appeared* and starting talking, but I was absorbed in what I was doing and didn't really pay him a huge amount of attention til he said, ""LordLeesa (he used my surname, of course), what are you doing here?"" in an annoyed tone of voice.

I was well-trained and well-brainwashed by then; I looked up wildly, starting to panic, wondering if somehow we were done on the range and I'd *missed my turn--!* or WHAT CATASTROPHIC STUPID THING HAD I--? but no, the line hadn't moved appreciably, I was the last person to go in my squad and we hadn't even gotten to my squad yet.  ""I'm sorry, Drill Sergeant?"" I said (probably falteringly).  

""Look,"" he said, ""I know what *they're* doing here--Soldier 1 and 2 and 3--"" (he said their surnames, and gestured towards them in their own respective lines), ""But I don't get what *you're* doing here, you or Soldier 4 or 5 or 6.""  (Another gesture.)  ""Any man would give any of you girls whatever you wanted.  You don't have to be here.""  

So--Sergeant Airborne was, you know, God.  He was *Airborne.*  He was 30 years old. He was in amazing shape.  He did everything right.  He knew not only everything we were supposed to learn like it was the back of his hand, he knew more stuff than any of us were *ever* going to learn or might not even be ever *capable* of learning.  He had *shot people.*  On purpose.  With good aim!  In heroic circumstances!  However, even so, I *still* couldn't let that slide--""But Drill Sergeant,"" I said, with as much dignity as my fearful self could muster, daring as I was to even remotely contradict a pronouncement of his, ""I don't WANT to be a prostitute!""  I was pretty horrified that he'd even *suggested*---what *did* he really think of me, OMG!

And I'd totally misunderstood him.  He actually looked horrified himself for a split second, and then even more annoyed than usual--""No, no *no* Private, I didn't mean *that.*""  Then he looked at me, rather earnestly--this was *not* a facial expression I was used to, not from him!  So I remember that very clearly too.  (I noticed for the first time ever that he had rather pretty big brown eyes, which felt extremely weird to think of at all.) ""Any man would be honored to take care of you, of any of you four girls.  You don't have to try to do this stuff.  Get hurt, get dirty.  Why are you here?""

And I had no idea what to say.  He pretty much flipped everything upside down for me, in that instant.  I'd thought I was doing all right, even a *good* job sometimes (occasionally?).  I'd thought *he'd* thought so.  I wasn't?  I shouldn't be here?  He wasn't being *mean.*  He *meant* it.  He was *concerned* for me.  But he *knew* I couldn't quit, right..?  (Literally, could not--the only way to do it was to go AWOL or lie about your drug history--say you DID do drugs, though you hadn't--or lie about your sexual orientation--say you WERE gay, even though you weren't--and even then, none of those resulted in an honorable discharge, and the first two might result in doing time on top of that.)  But he was clearly waiting for an answer and I certainly didn't have it in me to refuse to answer a drill sergeant--!  

So I said, in what was probably a tiny little voice, ""But I want to take care of *myself,* Drill Sergeant.""  Which was feeble, and he clearly thought so too.  But I had nothing else.  I wasn't any kind of practicing feminist, back then--I was barely any kind of anything really.  Just trying to survive, mostly, and figure out life as a grownup...

Or *worse,* do they just go *on* like it's totally natural to massively insult a professional peer to their face?  And what do you do, when this happens..?

So, you know, I was torn (mildly torn--I was tired, glad the conference was almost over, and looking forward to going home) over how to respond--in my more powerless days, I occasionally went along with the sexist crap; more often I pretended to be selectively deaf; and as I became less and less powerless, more and more often I had fun with the third option of completely messing with the speaker til he fled in surrender.  I *did* feel a faint spark of evil in my core, but as I said, I was tired, so I just went with option 2 and let my eyes unmistakably start to glaze over so that he went away shortly thereafter.

1034,6ffi2z,2017-06-05,FeMRADebates,Wonder Woman and Feminisim,"Some spoilers probably, be forewarned.

So I saw the new Wonder Woman this weekend. Putting ideology aside, I enjoyed the movie. Definitely the best DC film since the Dark Knight in my opinion. I'd give it a solid B, good but not necessarily great IMO. But probably better than the first Captain America film which it closely resembles in some ways.

---

Puting my ideological hat on, there are definitely going to be a lot of think pieces about what this movie, lead by a female lead and a female director, about a figure of female empowerment, has to say about feminism (for good or ill). I haven't read any of those pieces yet, so these are my thoughts on this subject unbiased by them. Perhaps somewhat rambling.

### Themyscira - The Magical City State of the Amazons
So the 'prolog' of the movie takes place on Themyscira, Wonder Woman's home island. It's a magical island concealed by the gods from the rest of mankind, and populated by the all woman, Amazons. Who live there in a utopian matriarchy. I think both the anti-SJW and the 'tumblr feminists' crowd will be taking special note of this part. As the plot line *could* be characterized as ""everything was good and perfect, then THE MENZ attacked.""

I don't know how much, if any, the director was trying to convey the point that ""a female only matriarchy would be utopia."" But some people will definitely read that into these scenes. For myself, I can give it a pass because well Themyscira is a magic island populated by a select group of magic women purposely fully created by ""the gods"" to teach 'mankind' how to love and be kind and all that jazz. Casting it as a reflection of actual reality is perhaps a bit much (although TBF, may be somewhat of the directors intent).

### Where are all the other Womenz?
So after we leave Themyscira, the other women pretty much drop out of the film. Like almost entirely. The only other female character of any note is Etta Candy, Steve Trevor's secretary and comic relief, and clearly subordinate to men. She drops out after a bit as well. And (one of) the villains, Dr Poison, who unfortunately is basically a henchwoman and also subordinate to a man.

It goes without saying that Wonder Woman is a figure of 'female empowerment.' But in the film she is the *only* one. All the rest of the women in the film are hapless civilians crying out to be saved, or background dressing, or both. I think this is a missed opportunity, since the film is set during in the middle of the Suffrage Movement as well, so there is there is a great opportunity to show other women being empowered, or at least struggling for empowerment, but aside from a throw away line you can easily missed, it's not even touched upon.

While this is a ""missed opportunity"" rather than something outright wrong with the film. I also think its its biggest criticism. The things your movie says can be found in both the things you say, and the things you don't say. And people can pick up on both. I feel like Wonder Woman is trying to say that ""Women can be empowered"" but by *only* showing Wonder Woman (a literal 'child of the gods') as empowered and *no* other women, you undercut this point a great deal I think.

(The director may be setting things up this way for another reason, I'll get to later, but the point remains regardless).

Ironically this movie may fail this Bechdel Test.

###Who is this film targeting?
Now I admit here, my feelings here are somewhat biased by my upbringing. When I think of Wonder Woman, my mind immediately goes to the 70s Lynda Carter version, which was *very* four color, and fairly hokey. I haven't watched it in several decades, so I can't speak to how good or bad it may have been as a comment on feminisim, but I can say that it is a show that would appeal to children. It appealed to me when I was a child, even though this was a good decade after it's released.

This Wonder Woman, keeping with the general theme of DC 'Nolanverse', is very dark, gritty, and adult. It's been a couple decades now since I was a child or teenager, and I've never been a girl. But I don't imagine it is going to be a film that is going to appeal to them as much as the Marvel films will. It's a film really asking for an R rating, but censors itself to get it down to PG-13 for the monies. War and the horrors of War is very much one of the themes of this film, and I dunno, this isn't kids stuff, and it's not something that stereotypically appeals to women. Perhaps that is something that should change, but I feel like you have to meet your audience where they are somewhat.

###Who is the Lead?
For a film called ""Wonder Woman"" you would not be wrong to question if she is actually the lead in the film. I mean, she *is* but Chris Evans's Steve Trevor plays a very *strong* role in the film. And ends up being the character driving most of the plot, with Wonder Woman as a bit of a tag along. To an extent this is expected with her playing the 'fish out of water' role. But to contrast it with the Marvel Films, Iron Man, Captain America, and, Dr Strange, are all very clearly lead by their main characters. This film... well not so much. The closest Marvel analog is probably Thor (where he also plays the ""fish out of water"" character) but there, Thor still has a much stronger role than his co-stars.

###Mankind or ""Men""? Wonder Woman or ""Women""?
I think a lot of your interpretation of this film may hinge upon if you interpret this film as meaning when it says ""mankind."" The Wonder Woman comic's often have this idea of Wonder Woman 'entering the world of men' but this exact phraseology is missing in the film. But the idea may still be there.

One of the central ideas of the plot is that ""'Mankind' is bad, and does not deserve 'Wonder Woman' to save them. But she will do it anyways because it's the right thing to do."" I don't think you would be wrong in wondering if what the film is trying to message with this is that ""'Men' are bad, and do not deserve 'Women' to save them. But they should do it anyways."" The film never outright gives a clear answer on this formulation, so I suspect your interpretation will depend upon if you were keyed to receive that later message (for good or for ill) before hand.

Myself, I think its reasonable to suspect the Director may have intended that. Almost every bad thing in the world is demonstrated by men (with the very notable exception of Dr. Poison). At one point Steve Trevor points out quite literally that he is, in a way, an embodiment of all the bad things in the world. The end boss, who is in some ways an incarnation of all the evil in the world, is also male. Wonder Woman is portrayed as the only 'pure goodness' in the film, somewhat of a shining beacon of goodness. Even her allies are scoundrels and flawed. 

Steve Trevor is of particular note. He literally calls himself out as a liar, a thief, a smuggler, and a murderer. So if Wonder Woman likes him what does that say? I feel the film kind of drops this point though without ever having Wonder Woman resolve the conflict of 'people she like having attributes she despises.'

I also think we maybe shouldn't read to much into it. The film having the idea that ""Women need to teach men about love and peace and get them to stop war"" (if it does) does not necessarily mean that ""women are in all ways perfect and good, and men are in all ways horrible and bad.""

### Is Wonder Woman a role model?
I think perhaps the biggest difference in the recent Marvel Movies and the recent DC movies is the way they portray their 'heroes.' In Marvel, the Heroes are people, just like you and me, flawed, and imperfect. Even (perhaps especially!) the Gods in the film are 'human' and relatable. Thor or Spider Man or Iron Man are characters I could aspire to, should I happen to get bit by a radio-active spider, pick up a hammer of the gods, or um be born a bazillionaire.

On the other hand, the DC 'heroes' tend toward the deific. They are Gods. Above us, and better than us in ways we could never match. I get the feeling that I can never be as good as Superman, or as Pure as Wonder Woman. The are roles meant to 'inspire' us (we are told that quite literally in Superman), although I personally do not find the existence of the deific particularly inspiring. It's easy to be courageous when your bulletproof after all. When they struggle, they don't struggle with issues I can comprehend, they are on a level above me. Which I feel makes them somewhat alien.

And thus Wonder Woman. She will of course inspire Children, who can see the obvious aspects of 'power' in her character which will appeal to them. But I wonder how well she will inspire those with more mature points of view. Wonder Woman may struggle with Gods and coming to grips of the reality of ""mankind"" but she does not know the struggle that we humans face. In particular, she doesn't face the same struggles 'women' stereotypically face. For example breaking out of the box that gender stereotypes may trap them into (not that men don't have those boxes to!). Wonder Woman is outside the box. What's more, she doesn't even seem to be aware the box is there.

In contrast I think everyone will be able to relate to Steve Trevor's character. Human, flawed, but still *very* courageous. And somewhat with the rest of his band of misfits. Perhaps there could have been a story that Wonder Woman reformed Trevor into a 'better man' but I get the feeling he was more or less unchanged. He enters the film as a self-sacrificing courageous hero, and exits it in the same way.

### The Patriarchy
The Patriarchy makes an obvious presence in the film when Wonder Woman goes to see the lead generals/politicians in Britain who all dismiss her because of her Gender. One might think this would be chance for Wonder Woman to ""smash the patriarchy"" as it goes, Wonder Woman spouts some dialog at them, but the confrontation is pretty much avoided, and Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor just go and do their stuff anyways. Making the 'all powerful patriarchy' seem rather toothless.

The film might also be saying something about the Patriarchy in how is positions all the background characters in the film. Soldiers and Civilians might be seen as its hapless victims of its oppression, unable to break out of its control. This might be why none of the women we see in the film are 'empowered' beyond Wonder Woman. This point is probably made most strongly by Etta Candy, who seems an intelligent person, but is under the thumb of men (characterized by Wonder Woman as 'Slavery'). Although I do not know how seriously you should take this point. I think it's a minor one.

### Male Disposability
MRA's will probably key on this. Heavy spoilers ahead.

So the film ends with Steve Trevor hijacking a plane loaded with 'super-mustard-gas' or something bound for London, and ultimately blowing it up with him inside it to save (that part) of the day (shades of Captain America!). Some may find this an example of ""Male Disposability.""

The film also shows many soldiers dieing, whose lives are not treated as particularly important (although I think their injuries are played for sympathy). However when the !Nazis shell the town where there are women and children located (along with soldiers), this is treated as a big deal. Wonder Woman even says ""even the Women and Children are there!"" Which is funny, because from her 'empowered' viewpoint, we might expect her to ask ""why aren't the rest of the women fighting?"" (which she never does). Instead she seem to be blind to the gender stereotype box she puts women into as 'noncombatants.' With lives more valuable then that of the soldiers.

Myself I don't key on this to much. I look at it as we expect that part of a solider role in war is to die. And this leads us to treat non-solider lives as more valuable then solider lives. I do wish the film at least paid some lip service to the idea that women do not *have* to be confined to role of non-combatant. But (aside from the obvious example of Wonder Woman) it doesn't.

----

I have more thoughts about some of the themes of the movie more generally. But I think I've rambled on enough as it is. On the whole I'd rate the film as a decent movie. But probably not a very good feminist movie (if that is its intention). To many missed opportunities.

1039,xihgoi,2022-09-19,FeMRADebates,An interesting passage from “The Right to Sex by Amia Srinivasan review – the politics of sexual attraction”,"I was watching a YouTube video by someone who'd had Amia Srinivasan as a professor when studying philosophy at Oxford (IIRC), who mentioned her recent (feminist) book, “The Right to Sex”. Well, that intrigued me, so I went searching it and I found [this review](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/aug/19/the-right-to-sex-by-amia-srinivasan-review-the-politics-of-sexual-attraction), in which I found this interesting passage:

>Starting in the 1980s, Srinivasan says in her chapter “Sex, Carceralism and Capitalism”, “US feminists successfully campaigned for states to adopt ‘mandatory arrest’ policies which require the police to make an arrest when they are called to a domestic violence complaint.” As research in Wisconsin has shown, this led to three times as many black men being arrested as white men, a significant contribution to the mass incarceration of black men. “When feminists embrace carceral solutions,” Srinivasan concludes, “they give cover to the governing class in its refusal to tackle the deepest causes of most crime.”

This reminded me of the MRM's complaint of mandatory arrest policies and their pointing out of how it has led to abused men being arrested even when they are the ones who call the police, due to automatic assumptions about who the abuser is. I found it interesting to see these mandatory arrest policies being brought up in another context for roughly the same reason, that being its disproportionate effects on different groups. The implication is that it reveals a racial bias.

Of course, we know that romantic relationships (and possibly especially where the partners are living together) are almost entirely intersexual (i.e. the partners are different sex), whereas racially, they tend to be intraracial (i.e. the partners are the same race). Given that, it seems to me the increase in black arrest rates reveals that black partners are more often calling the police (or having the police called on them by their likely black neighbours) for domestic violence, and it's hard to implicate the police officers themselves in the biased outcome, whereas the increase in arrest rates being almost entirely male seems more damning, especially when we have plenty of reports of men being arrested for being abused.

It's possible you have a black man and a white man in a relationship, and the black man calling the police for domestic abuse then being assumed to be the aggressor and arrested, but an interracial intrasexual relationship sounds like a much rarer occurrence than an intraracial intersexual relationship, where it seems the potential for anti-male bias is most frequent. There are also the interracial intersexual relationships, which would be the most obvious candidates for an intersectional analysis, and those would be relationships with a white man and black woman — where there is anti-male and anti-black biases to consider, and both could play out in the same DV call to the police where there's a sort of tug of war, or just one — and relationships with a black man and white woman — where there is anti-male and anti-black biases to consider and both or either could play out on the same person in the same DV call to the police.

Note that the quote points out the disparity in white male vs. black male incarceration, and the maleness of the incarcerateds are taken for granted, yet the far more frequent and easier to prove bias that plays out here, which frequency and relative ease of proving is just due to the sexuality and racuality configurations of most relationships, is completely ignored. In states with the Duluth model, the assumption of male aggressor is top down and systemic and even more blatant.

Then there are things like broader social attitudes about both men and blacks that are shared like stereotypes about being violent and dangerous even to the point that it motivates segregation, expectancy to give up their seat (that is mostly gone now, but still), being discouraged from going to certain businesses or in ads for rooms for rent.

Also people often like to say something like ""straight white man privilege"" to add that being gay is a disadvantage too, but they seem to forget that only really applies to men, because it's not really one for women. A lot of women seem to go out of their way to claim they're bisexual but you don't really see that too much with men.

>Gender inequality and sexist behaviour is prevalent in almost all workplaces and rampant in online environments. Although there is much research dedicated to understanding sexist behaviour, we have almost no insight into what triggers this behaviour and the individuals that initiate it. Although social constructionist theory argues that sexism is a response towards women entering a male dominated arena, this perspective doesn’t explain why only a subset of males behave in this way. We argue that a clearer understanding of sexist behaviour can be gained through an evolutionary perspective that considers evolved differences in intra-sexual competition. We hypothesised that female-initiated disruption of a male hierarchy incites hostile behaviour from poor performing males who stand to lose the most status. To test this hypothesis, we used an online first-person shooter video game that removes signals of dominance but provides information on gender, individual performance, and skill. We show that lower-skilled players were more hostile towards a female-voiced teammate, especially when performing poorly. In contrast, lower-skilled players behaved submissively towards a male-voiced player in the identical scenario. This difference in gender-directed behaviour became more extreme with poorer focal-player performance. We suggest that low-status males increase female-directed hostility to minimize the loss of status as a consequence of hierarchical reconfiguration resulting from the entrance of a woman into the competitive arena. Higher-skilled players, in contrast, were more positive towards a female relative to a male teammate. As higher-skilled players have less to fear from hierarchical reorganization, we argue that these males behave more positively in an attempt to support and garner a female player’s attention. Our results provide the clearest picture of inter-sexual competition to date, highlighting the importance of considering an evolutionary perspective when exploring the factors that affect male hostility towards women.

1043,21o0p6,2014-03-29,FeMRADebates,Creeptasmic,"Hey sexy people,

Just wanted to share a few random thoughts on a recent event. So I'm hanging out at the mall, alone, waiting to meet a friend. My clothing is in the middle ground between revealing and conservative, but I consider myself a fairly attractive woman, and I tend to enjoy when people agree with that assessment.

Except...when...specific people agree with that assessment. Namely, I'm sitting there, minding my own business, poking at my 4"" square of digital connectivity, when a decidedly unclean man walks up to me. He's wearing a stained fabric coat, his greasy hair an unkempt mop, and sporting a shameless boner through unfortunately loose sweatpants.

Now I've met my share of the unkempt and seen the seedy underbelly of the world, but this guy walks confidently up to me, and tells me that I'm gorgeous, and starts hitting on me. I'm openly uncomfy. I'm feeling not so safe. I tried my hardest to shut him down softly, being lightly dismissive, looking away, showing disinterest. *No catch.* He starts rubbing his boner, and asking me if I have a boyfriend. Now, I don't have a boyfriend, but you have NO IDEA HOW MUCH OF A BOYFRIEND I HAD RIGHT THEN. MY BOYFRIEND EXISTED LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS. I WAS IN DEEP DEEP LOVE WITH THE MAN OF MY DREAMS. *No catch.* Now he asks if I ever shower with my boyfriend. I start to feel clairvoyant, as if I can read this man's mind, as if I know exactly what he's thinking.

I told him that no, I never showered with my boyfriend. Then I stood up, and walked to the ladies room, where he, almost surprisingly, did not follow.

So anyways, bunch of things to talk about here. But most primarily, I think that kind of uncomfortable sexual situation happens all the time with girls, and very rarely with guys. I think most girls here experience something on par with this about once every couple of years, and it's pretty rough. 

But, while I felt insecure and scared in the moment, later I realized...I don't think that was his intention. I think he was...a few marbles short of a full collection...he had needs that weren't filled. I felt sad that he had fallen through society's cracks, into a life of clear poverty, if not homelessness. Now that I'm feeling safe and secure in my home, typing on my computer, with my fast internet, plentiful food, and...I mean...just the basics of the modern first world...he's probably huddled in some frozen corner of the world, falling deeper through the cracks in society's net.

But yeah...I don't know really if this is a debate...might lead to interesting discussion though...I just kind of wanted to share my experience with the community.

1045,2w1c3a,2015-02-16,FeMRADebates,Does society really favor masculinity over femininity or does it simply favor conformity?,"Although there are many different viewpoints within feminism, common to most is the belief that society favors the masculine over the feminine.

I think that in many scenarios it is true that some traits traditionally associated with masculinity are valued. This is because those traits actually provide practical benefits in those scenarios. In business, assertiveness, rationality and competitiveness are useful.

However, not all traditionally masculine traits are valued. Aggression, Sexual forwardness and insubordination are a hindrance in business and will get you fired.

Other traits, like risk taking, can go either way, depending on how they are expressed.

Feminine traits are also valued in business. Cooperation and Communication are vital and highly valued.

The male traits are probably more highly valued in business but the most likely explanation for this isn't some disdain for women, it's that business and masculinity developed side-by-side. It was the domain of men so took a form which used masculine traits to the greatest advantage, it probably also played a large role in defining what expectations were placed on men, as men had to fit themselves into this world.

Is this something which could be improved? Absolutely. However, arbitrarily devaluing productive traits and promoting counter-productive traits isn't going to help anyone. We need to honestly look at which masculine traits are overvalued and which feminine traits are undervalued in terms of their effect on productivity. This may still result in masculine traits being more valued by business. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the case because, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, the business world has probably shaped traditional masculinity, promoting traits which help business. If that is the case, then the solution is not to artificially promote feminine traits in the business world. The solution is for individual women, who want to participate in that world, to work on strengthening the valued masculine traits in themselves.

There are also careers which clearly favor femininity over masculinity. However, these tend to be lower-paid than the careers which favor masculine traits. Many feminists assert that this is further evidence that masculinity is more highly valued. However, the pay in an industry is the result of market forces, not some committee which decided that teachers are less valuable than engineers because engineers are masculine. 

The business world is not the entirety of human civilisation. Some people turn it into their entire world, and a great deal of feminist rhetoric seems to emphasize its value over other aspects of life but, personally, to me work is simply a necessary evil, something I have to participate in so that I can fully enjoy the parts of life which actually matter. 

In other contexts, the feminine is valued over the masculine. Socially, empathy is valued and in the family nurturing is valued. Look at how common is is for heterosexual women to lament that their partners aren't in touch with their feminine sides. Men tend not to complain that their female partners aren't masculine enough. People, male and female, have a natural preference for women.

Of course the social benefits of femininity are generally only available to women (and in some contexts homosexual men). This is because, more than masculinity or femininity, it is conformity which is valued. Society favors people who conform to their assigned gender roles. That is, it values masculinity in men and femininity in women. 

If it was simply masculinity being valued then masculine women would be favored over feminine women. This is clearly not the case. Feminine women get a much more positive reaction. 

Many feminists even complain that the masculine traits which are seen as positive in men get a negative reaction when expressed by women (for example ""Ban Bossy""). I don't agree with all of this rhetoric because I don't think that women who get labelled ""bossy"" are really performing leadership in the same way as men who are considered ""leaders"". However, it is clear that the reaction to the performance of masculinity or femininity is dependent on the gender of the performer.

The effects of this are not symmetrical. The consequences of gender nonconformity for men are significantly more severe than for women. This is why I feel my earlier suggestion, that women who want to participate in the business world should cultivate masculine traits, is not unreasonable, or at least less unreasonable than promoting unproductive traits in business.

This asymmetry has been interpreted as misogyny. It's often pointed out that men are insulted by comparing them to women and suggested that this is proof that society thinks men are better than women. Really, the insult does not mean that the man being insulted is considered a woman (they would not face such aggression if they really did have the status of a woman). It means that they have failed to perform their expected role as a man.

I also think that this asymmetry (or at least the severity of it) is a recent development. Historically, masculinity in women would have been as severely punished as femininity in men. However, we have had decades of feminist activism fighting to open up the traditionally masculine to women.",ParanoidAgnostic,t2_brjgh,0.85,24,37

Basically, the story is that this woman develops a crush on this complete stranger, and begins stalking him. In doing so, she comes across him surrounded by a bunch of other women. It makes her angry that he's with women who aren't her. And so she murders him

&#x200B;

So naturally, the vast majority of the top responses are all very sympathetic to her, saying things like ""she so **relatable**!"", ""he's **a fuckboy who didn't deserve her anyway**"", ""I hope she has a happy ending where she finds someone **worthy of her**"", etc. etc. And talking about how much of a ""jerk"" he is for...having multiple partners, apparently?

&#x200B;

*Tell me why this isn't ridiculous and also a complete double standard?* It's not like the characters were dating in the first place (and it's not like if they were, that would justify her murdering him). Can you imagine a story where a man stalks then murders a woman--who doesn't even know him--for sleeping with other men, and a bunch on men in the comments going **""relatable"" ""she's a slut who didn't deserve him anyway,"" ""he's worth a good, virgin woman""**, etc.

Despite the increasing rise against slut-shaming, *""fuckboys"", ""womanizers"", ""players""* still get a lot of shit and are generally seen as good-for-nothing assholes.

For those so inclined, [here is the original link](https://www.buzzfeed.com/thirstywoman/dear-men-a-thirsty-womans-thoughts-on-nice-men-3bg7e).

Author claims to understand a man's point of view on the back of being an initiator herself (which to be fair is a quite positive feather for her cap; I will not begrudge her that!) but then goes on to claim that men are taught to feel entitled to sex and feel ownership over women's bodies, including hers.

I won't argue that zero males feel that way at some level, or that zero would trace those feelings to what they were taught. But claiming that any majority on one hand or Aziz Anzari (per the published article, which author makes examples out of) demonstrated as much in particular is abjectly preposterous. 

Because if that was how males *actually* felt, then some *majority* of 150 million or more people in this country would be out finding ways to cavalierly commit rape on a regular basis.

What I read is that author (as well as all others I've heard making similar claims) are simply re-framing to ""men feel entitled to sex / our bodies"" from the reality of ""men feel entitled to *reject* our property claims over *their* sexual attention"". For example: man makes a pass at such a woman, she then views said errant sexual attention as an attack on her body. Man makes eyes at *another* woman while they are in a relationship, and this elicits virtually identical ire: he must feel entitled to the *other* woman's body, or to this woman's without honoring their covenant of ocular (and of course imaginative) exclusivity.

> Flirting is about paying close attention to the other person and how they feel. In this way flirtation becomes a conversation between two people who are attracted to each other. This slow escalation gives everyone involved many lower risk opportunities to slow things down or stop them should they feel uncomfortable. 

EG: everybody's courtship rituals must be identical to hers. She's never met a person who gets bored when things move too slowly, or when the initiator *who is socially expected to be the initiator* fails to take on enough risk. 

No, she is *not* supposed to be the initiator per common gender roles, so she'll meet primarily nothing but men willing to meet her more than halfway. EG: she benefits from the results measured by [the Clark-Hatfield Sexual Proposal](http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/03/gender-differences-and-casual-sex-the-new-research/) and presumes that every man has that advantage laid equally to his feet.

> Harassing a person happens when you impose your desires on them without considering their feelings. Harassing happens when you ignore that the person you touched on the shoulder froze, or stepped away from you after you touched them. Harassing happens when you say crude things to or touch a woman you have never spoken to.

Can somebody get this person a dictionary? [It's not harassment unless it is *repeated* or *persistent* disturbance, torment, or persecution](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/harass). This is just one more author pushing to redefine the word to mean ""anything a man does that we women fail to ecstatically enjoy"". He made a mis-step for a fraction of a second? Throw the fucker in prison, because apparently nobody has time for less than perfect social interaction with other human beings anymore.

> Many of you are just oblivious to the subtle cues a woman may give when she wants you to leave her alone. You do not mean to make them uncomfortable by persisting in your unwanted flirtation, but you not meaning to make a person uncomfortable is irrelevant to whether you actually made a person feel uncomfortable.

More of the same: talk to me, and you must take on 100% responsibility for my private discomfort.

> Every year, women get attacked or even killed by men whose advances they reject. 

Please quantify this by comparing it against the number of men who are attacked and killed by tipped over vending machines, and then contrast female fear of clear communication with male fear of getting a pepsi.

*Billions* of rejections happen per year. You cannot bring the fatality rate to below 1 per billion, and every time people try to shame several billion men for that being anything other than zero all we learn is that folks love to cry wolf.

1053,m919hq,2021-03-20,FeMRADebates,Being stay-at-home is a privilege,"Privilege is about choice.

The only way people can deny what people commonly term 'female privilege' is to claim that women’s choice is a forced decision and men’s forced position is a choice. This is a common myth.

Being *allowed* – not *forced* – to stay at home is a privilege. Historically, only some women had that privilege. Men were *forced* – not *allowed* – to go to work to support women.

The difference between being *allowed* to do something and being *forced* is important. It’s the difference between employment and slavery. Between sex and rape. Between imprisonment and accommodation. This is why feminists always frame men being forced to do something as men being ‘allowed’ to. eg the draft – men being forced to fight – is cast as men being ‘allowed’ to fight. Gender roles – men being forced to support women under threat of imprisonment – are phrased as men being ‘allowed’ to work. This is as ridiculous as a man claiming female rape victims are privileged because they are “allowed to have sex.” Or slaves are privileged because they are “allowed to work.” Or conscripted men are privileged because they are “allowed to fight.”

Some people believe men historically (and present) were not forced to work and that women were not ‘allowed’ to work, but this is incorrect so let's run down the facts.

**Fact #1: Most men prefer staying at home**

A [survey](https://web.archive.org/web/20140712161707/http://www.about-monster.com/content/monster-survey-finds-more-fathers-seek-success-both-office-and-home) done in 2007 found that 68% percent of fathers would be a stay-at-home parent if money were no object. Another [survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2013/12/11/chapter-5-balancing-work-and-family/) done by the Pew Research Center found that 87% of men who did quit their job after having a child to stay at home say they are glad they did. Warren Farrell reported in “The Myth of Male Power” that 80% of men he surveyed said that if they could stay at home with no loss of income and their wives approval, they would. Only 3% said they would prefer to work full-time.

**Fact #2: Most women do not want to work outside the home**

A [survey](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2007/07/12/fewer-mothers-prefer-full-time-work/) done by the Pew Research Center found that among women at home with children less than 18, only 16% (less than one in six) say they want to work outside the home full-time. That [drops](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/08/19/mothers-and-work-whats-ideal/) to 12% if the children are young. For women with children who do work full-time outside the home, more than half want to change to working part-time or not working at all, according to yet another [survey](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/08/19/mothers-and-work-whats-ideal/) done by the Pew Research Center.

Women are 38% [more](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/12/11/chapter-5-balancing-work-and-family/) [likely](https://sci-hub.tw/http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0192513x10370108) to file for divorce if she works more than her husband than vice versa, and 29% more likely to divorce if they have had to increase the number of hours worked outside the home in the last 5 years. As The Atlantic [reported](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/12/moms-who-cut-back-at-work-are-happier/282460/):

>Two facts are often obscured in the public conversation devoted to women, work, and family. First, the vast majority of married mothers don’t want to work full-time. Second, married mothers who are able to cut back at work to accommodate their family’s needs tend to be happier. The news cycle is stuck in a lean-in loop, but new data show mothers report more happiness when they can lean homeward.

In a 1985 Roper [survey](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1986/09/women-in-the-work-force/304924/), only 10 percent of women declared that a husband should turn down a very good job in another city “so the wife can continue her job.""

An [overview](http://www.lse.ac.uk/website-archive/newsAndMedia/newsArchives/2010/08/CatherineHakimRenewal.pdf) of multiple studies across Europe concluded that only 14%-20% of women aged 16+ are “work-centered” which it defines as “Committed to work or equivalent activities”. The author concludes:

>“Feminists constantly complain that men are not doing their fair share of domestic work. The reality is that most men already do more than their fair share.” and “As factual data replaces received wisdom, several well-entrenched feminist myths have been overturned … Men do substantially more hours of paid work.”

**Fact #3: Historically, women were allowed to work outside the home.**

In early agricultural societies, women [worked](http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/prehistoric-womens-manual-work-was-tougher-than-rowing-in-todays-elite-boat-crews) by grinding grain for as much as 5 hours a day to make flour, in addition to tilling soil and harvesting crops by hand. This has [been](https://www.routledge.com/A-History-of-European-Womens-Work-1700-to-the-Present/Simonton/p/book/9780415055321) [confirmed](https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Visible-Women-European-History/dp/0395796253) by studies of Ancient Egypt which show that almost all non-aristocratic women worked, including spinning, combing, and carding cloth.

From the 13th to the 17th Century, most brewers were women. A [survey](https://www.amazon.com/Ale-Beer-Brewsters-England-Changing/dp/0195126505) in 1228 found 80% of brewers in towns were female. A [study](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C5D42E9BA2C056B5BF2CD074A26A2D8A/S0020859000114786a.pdf/origins_and_expansion_of_the_male_breadwinner_family_the_case_of_nineteenthcentury_britain.pdf) of 1,350 working-class households from early 19th Century Britain suggests that the husbands’ proportion of family earning was as low as 55 percent.

Between 1787 to 1815 in families with unemployed children, wives [earned](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-review-of-social-history/article/origins-and-expansion-of-the-male-breadwinner-family-the-case-of-nineteenthcentury-britain/C5D42E9BA2C056B5BF2CD074A26A2D8A) 41 percent of household income. In this same period, 66% of married women had a [recorded](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2597872?seq=1) occupation. In 1833 Britain, [women](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Report_from_Dr_James_Mitchell_to_the_Cen/1jp_YgEACAAJ?hl=en) [made](http://eh.net/encyclopedia/women-workers-in-the-british-industrial-revolution/) up 57% – the majority – of factory workers. Even in labor-intensive agricultural work, significant numbers of women [worked](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2566496?seq=1).

[https://imgur.com/a/MFGBrg2](https://imgur.com/a/MFGBrg2)

However, by 1851 the proportion of married women who worked had [dropped](http://eh.net/encyclopedia/women-workers-in-the-british-industrial-revolution/) to 30%. The share of household income generated by women started to [decline](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-review-of-social-history/article/origins-and-expansion-of-the-male-breadwinner-family-the-case-of-nineteenthcentury-britain/C5D42E9BA2C056B5BF2CD074A26A2D8A) [rapidly](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0020859000114786) from around 1830 onwards. Notably, this involved “increased leisure for women and children” with the percentage of income generated by men increasing from 55% in 1831-1855 up to 81% in 1860-1865.

[https://imgur.com/a/1o4NdJK](https://imgur.com/a/1o4NdJK)

By 1890, women’s work in Europe and the United States contributed just 1.9 percent to 3 percent of household [income](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Life-Cycle%2C-Savings%2C-and-Demographic-Some-for-Haines/cf9b3e594a01e5842c77553a6115bb8de9cf1842). This was entirely because of married women being supported by their husbands. By 1887, 3/4 of female workers in American cities were under 25 years old. 96% of them were single.

By 1911 only 25% of British women [worked](https://www.meta-katalog.eu/Record/4796fmt/HierarchyTree?recordID=4796fmt). In 1920 in the US, women were only 21% of [employed](https://www.dol.gov/wb/info_about_wb/interwb.htm) adults.

We can speculate this was because the extra wealth from industrialization meant it became possible for some people to not work outside the home, and women got this benefit. This is supported by the fact that the total working hours have [dropped](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/05/working-hours) by almost half since 1870.

This change from the vast majority of women working (pre-1850s) to a small percentage (by 1920s) was overwhelmingly welcomed by women, and universally seen as a benefit to women.

John Stuart Mill thought that “it is not… a desirable custom that the wife should contribute by her labor to the income of the family.”

The German Government stated in 1940: “the goal remains to ensure that, in 20 years’ time, no woman is obliged to work in a factory.”

In the Soviet Union, when mothers got permission to work part-time instead of full time, and fathers still had to work full-time, this was welcomed as “liberating” by women’s [groups](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/106591299304600113).

Even as late as 1915 women’s rights campaigner Clementina Black was [complaining](https://archive.org/stream/cu31924002665739/cu31924002665739_djvu.txt) about the fact that married women, as well as single women, had to work to earn money.

During WWII, when many women had to do war work in factories, it was found that women had been “made miserable by the \[war work\]” and “fervently wished themselves back into their prewar home routine.”

During the war, there were many efforts to get women to enter the workforce, but very few did meaning that they were given the choice.

Men, however, [were not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevin_Boys).

**Fact #4: Historically, men were forced to work outside the home**

As early as 92 BC men were forced to support their wives by law.

Men who refused to support their wives were legally punished under Roman law.

Under the common law of ‘coverture’, which existed in England from at least 1660 to the 19th century, and in America until 1839 “A wife was entitled to be maintained by her husband” – if she got into any debts, the husband had to pay them. If he refused, he could be imprisoned in debtors' prison. Wives could not be sued or imprisoned for debt.

It’s because of this that 18th-century [texts](http://www.academia.edu/746242/Favoured_or_oppressed_Married_women_property_and_coverturein_England_1660_1800) said that a married Woman ‘is a Favourite of the Law’ and described England as ‘the Paradise of women.'

Coverture was only legally abolished by the Married Women’s Property Act of 1882 (in the UK). Men were responsible for paying women’s income tax for much longer, and this was exploited by suffragettes to send their husbands to jail simply by her refusing to pay tax.

An article from 1912 [notes](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5JQWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7CAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6049,712919&dq):

>Under the married women property act a husband has no jurisdiction over his wife’s property and income. Under the income tax he is responsible for her taxes. If the taxes are not paid, the husband, not the wife, is imprisoned. Mrs. Wilks refused to pay her income tax – $185 – and her husband was locked up. He will spend the rest of his life in prison unless his wife pays or the law is changed.

In 1660, a Venetian noblewoman [wrote](https://gynocentrism.com/2013/09/12/lucrezia-marinella-gynocentrism-in-the-16th-century/):

>It is a marvelous sight in our city to see the wife of a shoemaker or butcher or even a porter all dressed up with gold chains round her neck, with pearls and valuable rings on her fingers, accompanied by a pair of women on either side to assist her and give her a hand, and then, by contrast, to see her husband cutting up meat all soiled with ox’s blood and down at heel, or loaded up like a beast of burden dressed in rough cloth, as porters are…. In France men may not spend even a centime unless at the request of their wives, and women not only administrate business dealings and sales but private income as well.

In the 19th Century, women could sue their husbands for maintenance while still married, and if she won the man could be imprisoned.

Even after the English common law of ‘coverture’ was replaced, men were legally obliged to support their wives. This was reinforced in successive acts of parliament in 1861, 1881, 1920, and 1964.

Even after the official end of coverture in Britain with the Married Women’s Property Act of 1882 husbands’ were liable for debts their wives had from before they were married. Men could, and were, [imprisoned](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/45-46/75/enacted) for not paying their wives' debts.

This obligation to support his wife stayed in force even if the couple lived apart, even if she had abandoned him and with no obligation on her (note divorces were extremely difficult to obtain in this period).

Around 1901, this newspaper published this heartfelt letter from 37 husbands jailed for non-support, begging their wives to let them out just for the upcoming holiday:

[https://imgur.com/a/URIuwLx](https://imgur.com/a/URIuwLx)

Under [Sharia (Islamic) law](http://syaria.com/568-on-using-wifes-salary.html) a man must support his wife: “Allah has ordained men to earn the living of his wife and children”

“A husband is obliged to earn the living for his wife and fulfill all her needs although his wife is a rich woman. The riches of a wife doesn’t nullify her right, which is the obligation of her husband.” But any money a married woman earns is her own and she has no obligation to spend it to support her husband or children.

The Constitution of the Republic of Ireland (written in 1937) explicitly states women – and only women – shall not be obliged to work:

>...the State shall, therefore, endeavour to insure mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour

Similarly, in the U.S, the law is highly [gendered](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/230140287.pdf), with the United States Supreme Court striking down an Alabama law that denied alimony to a person simply because he is male.

And as of now, only about 3% of alimony recipients of men, and campaigners admit alimony laws are only now being reformed due to the fact that now some women are having to pay.

**Fact #5: Men have historically worked much harder labor than women**

Even from an etymological perspective, the Biblical term eved, “slave,” only has a male form. The terms for “female slave,” shifcha and ama, are related to the Semitic words for “female” and “family.“ “This reflects the fact that female slaves often served as concubines. Clearly, neither term connotes anything to do with labor. Similarly, in Germanic languages, Arbeiter (laborer) was originally male and only acquired its female form after 1800. A second word, schaffen, is said to be derived from the Old German scaffan, “bent double.” “In addition to its primary meaning of “to create,” it also means “to succeed by hard work,” “to toil,” or “to slog.” The derivative term for “worker,” Schaffer, is male and often used as a surname. As such, it has no female equivalent.”

Reality reflects these etymological roots throughout history. In ancient [Egypt](https://www.amazon.com/Slavery-Ancient-Near-East-Comparative/dp/0313204993), the 100,000 people conscripted each year to build the pyramids who, as pictures show, were soundly whipped when they did not pull their weight were not women, but men. Men, whether prisoners of war or those enlisted by press-gangs, constructed roads, dug canals, erected fortresses, and built temples all over the ancient Middle East.

According to the Bible, King Solomon used tens of thousands of male slaves to obtain the materials for building the Lord’s Temple. Men, not women, built the Great Wall of China, dying by the thousands in the process. Countless male slaves, but very few female ones, worked in the silver mines of Laurion from which classical Athens derived much of its wealth.

Men, not women, sometimes took the place of beasts of burden in turning industrial-scale mills where corn was ground. Much like modern prisons, the places where such work was done were normally considered too unsavory to attract visits by members of polite society. During the second century A.D, however, one of them was inspected by the Roman writer Apuleius, who reported that:

>Merciful gods, what wretched manikins did I see there, their entire skin covered with bluish welts, their backs torn into bloody strips, barely covered with rags, some having only their genitals covered with a piece of cloth, all of them showing everything through their tatters. Their foreheads were branded with letters, their heads half shorn, their feet stuck in rings. They were hideously pale, the dank of the stinking hole had consumed their eyelashes and diminished their sight. Like wrestlers, who are sprinkled with a fine powder as they fight their bouts, they were blanched with a layer of dirty-white flour.

Being a female slave, to be sure, was hardly all fun and games, both because of the nature of their labor and because they were sexually at the mercy of their owners. However, a scrawny prostitute, or one dressed in tatters, or one too frightened to properly play her role, would have commanded a much lower price, if any. Hence workers in the oldest profession are usually well fed, reasonably clothed and tolerably housed. They are also unlikely to undergo physical punishment so severe as to permanently damage their charms. In any case, as references in Petronius, Horace and Seneca show, male slaves were also open to sexual exploitation.

Source: Petronius, Satyricon, 75.11; Horace, Satires, 1.2.116-19; Seneca, Controversies, IB praef. 1. See also Beert C. Verstraete, ""Slavery and the Social Dynamics of Male Homosexual Relations in Ancient Rome,"" Journal of Homosexuality, 5, 3, spring 1980, pp. 227-36.

In 19th-century America, it was cowboys, not cowgirls, who spent weeks on the trail, sleeping in the open air, unable to wash, shave or change clothes, while driving cattle from grazing ground to market and from market to railhead. In other societies, too, the less pleasant, the more demanding and the more dangerous a job, the more likely it was to be done by men.

Etc. etc.

All of this has and still leads to women having:

* A better work-life balance,
* higher reported levels of life satisfaction,
* higher reported levels of happiness,
* more free time,
* more time spent at home,
* better health outcomes,
* lower mortality rates,
* and a longer life.

Though it is a long and persisting myth that women were confined to the domestic sphere and that men got to work jobs which is a privilege, this is discounted by all the relevant data.

1058,voaoy5,2022-06-30,FeMRADebates,Arrest warrant for woman who accused Emmett Till found nearly 70 years later in court basement,"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/emmett-till-accuser-carolyn-bryant-donham-arrest-warrant-found-1955-kidnapping-case/

An old warrant was recently discovered for the arrest of Carolyn Bryant, the white woman who falsely accused Emmett Till, a black boy, of making sexual advances towards her and identified him to the men who murdered him. This atrocity, and the outrageous acquittal of the murderers by an all-white jury, motivated the American civil rights movement. But intersectional thinkers ought to also recognize a gender component to the murder: as a black boy, Till was vulnerable to accusations of impropriety from a white woman in a way that black girls were not.

Intersectional feminist literature, however, routinely fails to recognize this basic point. [Feminist books aimed at young adults](https://dc.etsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4844&context=etd) portray Bryant as sharing in Till's victimhood at the hands of her husband, and a grad school author analyzing the books unironically uses this false accusation to highlight women's sexual victimization. Others focus on Till's [polio-induced speech disability](https://www.talilalewis.com/blog/emmett-till-disability-erasure) which may have been mistaken by Bryant for a sexual wolf-whistle; but do not interrogate how our society punishes harmless expressions of male sexuality. Masculinists (that is, feminists who study masculinity) almost get it, observing ""[the trope of protecting White womanhood](https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/2863/)"" (scare-capitalization?) at trial. Unfortunately they segue into discussing ""masculine anxiety for White men"", rather than the victim's masculinity. Rebuffing Susan Brownmiller's attempt to paint 14-year old Till as a masculine menace, intersectional feminist Angela Davis also [emphasizes the racial component of Till's murder](https://isreview.org/issue/91/black-feminism-and-intersectionality/index.html):

>In choosing to take sides with white women, regardless of the circumstances, Brownmiller herself capitulates to racism. Her failure to alert white women about the urgency of combining a fierce challenge to racism with the necessary battle against sexism is an important plus for the forces of racism today.

These scholars aren't wrong, but perhaps as a direct result of their feminist lens, they overlook the obvious fact that Till was killed for his gender as well as his race. Do intersectional thinkers have a blind spot when it comes to male victims? Given that Till's murder is placed in the context of women's sexual victimization, disability issues, and white male anxiety, is it also appropriate or enlightening to place it in the context of false accusations and male victimization? Or does the oppression of blacks in the Jim Crow south, and/or their continued oppression/disadvantage in the justice system, make a racial lens uniquely appropriate for looking at Till's murder? And should Bryant be prosecuted for her role in Till's kidnapping and murder?",yoshi_win,t2_fbjzv,0.92,41,7
1059,3kzaw4,2015-09-15,FeMRADebates,Why isn't feminism strongly antireligious?,"This is a genuine question that has been bothering me for a very long time now. Why doesn't the feminist movement fight strongly and openly against Abrahamic religion?

I understand there are some atheist feminists. I was even linked to [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist_feminism) earlier today. It seems like there was a promising start, which then dwindled out into individual voices. I am asking, why isn't the *whole* of feminism atheist from its very foundations?

1. I have seen feminism nebulously blame harmful, traditionalist gender roles on ""culture"" or ""society"". It seems obvious to me that the single biggest sources keeping these ideas alive are Christianity, Judaism and Islam. The holy texts of these religions make it *crystal clear* that women are beneath men and that wives are supposed to submit to husbands like slaves. There are passages about how God intends women to suffer in childbirth for their wickedness, prayers for men to thank God they were not born female, commands that a woman shall be silent and teach nothing to men. Is it surprising that the more-religious countries tend to act out these attitudes? Can there be any bigger **patr**iarchy than rule by a Holy **Father**?

2. It is not ""old white men"" who want to restrict women's access to abortion and contraceptives, it's Catholics and Evangelicals. If it were just old white men, the democrats would be doing it too. Instead it's the party most closely tied to religion and traditionalism. Every time I've seen an antiabortion demonstration, both genders make up the crowd. There often seems to be *more* women. This is not one gender oppressing the other, it is ideology oppressing gender.

I cannot reconcile this. If feminism is so committed to ending gender oppression, why does it not strike at the root? There is so much feminist indictment of pop culture and media, but very little said about an even bigger influence on people's values and morality. What if feminism had been an atheist movement from the start? What if the early icons encouraged women to not just enter the workplace, but to leave the churches? What if the New Atheism had been started *decades earlier* by Steinem, Friedan, Hooks and Ensler instead of Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris and Dennet? What progress might we have made if women and men had been encouraged to not just reject sexist ideas, but also the *source* and *lifeblood* of those ideas?

Full disclosure: I am an MRA. But I'm a staunchly pro-choice, pro-contraception and anti-traditionalist one. I want archaic, sexist gender roles to go away as much as anyone. And while I may not be a feminist, I'm trying to say here, ""We have a common enemy. Someone who has been openly attacking you and opposing all you stand for, and I don't see you fighting back! Certainly not with all the strength I've seen you use against other ills. At least help me understand **why.**""",AlexReynard,t2_ab2yx,0.78,17,85
1060,808z85,2018-02-26,FeMRADebates,‘I just want it to stop’: Women get sex toys in packages they didn’t order,"I found [this article](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2018/02/19/these-surprise-packages-from-amazon-spark-something-more-than-frustration-fear/6X4X2rWJw3SawwCGe4n2rJ/story.html) posted on Bruce Schneier (computer security researcher)'s blog, and then was amazed to see some relatively FeMRA like discussion [going on in the comments on his side](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/02/harassment_by_p.html).

Consensus from comments includes things like ""It's BS that Amazon takes no responsibility for these kinds of (almost certainly) malicious orders"" and ""It's BS how sexist the LEA are being"".

But what's not in consensus is how justified the recipients are in feeling endangered as a result of the packages.

So what do you lot think? Does this just represent a new twist on the older than the hills practice of prank pizza delivery and glitter bombs? Should people fear for their safety while the FBI mobilizes an international ~~man~~person hunt for the woman-hating terrorists who probably keyed in the order from a laptop right under each woman's bed, just waiting for the right moment to pounce?

For me this just ties into the constant issue of anything that passes beyond the platonic while failing to be a [theme park experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/3byrhs/female_headmaster_bans_short_skirts_article_spins/csr78kp?context=2) instantly representing a [quintiscential variant](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil) of violence against women in particular, and that in turn makes me feel as though women are being infantilized or cast as having some essential kind of disability.",jesset77,t2_4kyww,0.74,11,21
1061,2c7xi3,2014-07-31,FeMRADebates,On one sided progress (specifically gender roles),"So I want to talk about uneven progress in achieving equality. One of the best (worst?) examples to me is the deconstruction of traditional female roles. At one point in history it was unacceptable for women to wear anything else but a skirt or dress. Thankfully that isn't the case anymore in western culture. Woman also have a better representation in the work force, appearing in higher offices and more prominence than ever before. Now one of the big arguments for why men haven't had the same rate of deconstruction is the whole idea femmephobia, where women were allowed to fall into more traditionally masculine rolls because they were viewed as strong and feminine weak. I think however that it has more to do with feminism spending generations changing what was acceptable, to me that's one of it's greatest accomplishments. However because feminism was focused, and rightfully, on female issues no work was done to help men escape their gender roles. I still think there's a great deal of work to be done for both genders though and even more for trans individuals.

Now i want to ask, is unequal progress ok, or even sometimes necessary? Should we always strive to progress everyone at the same rate even when it's not necessarily feasible? Should we focus more effort on progressing in directions that are more difficult or fix easy things (in comparison) first and then consolidate resources to focus on the more difficult situation after?",MamaWeegee94,t2_gsrz3,0.6,4,69
1062,2kaq25,2014-10-25,FeMRADebates,Misogyny: a self-fulfilling prophecy,"Once I met a girl who believed that all men hate women. We were students, waiting in front of a classroom for a teacher. We were in the first grade (EDIT: at university), it was September, most of us didn't know each other yet. So I decided to break ice, and said ""hi"" to a few people. So far, all of them seemed happy that someone else took initiative. Then I talked with them shortly, and introduced them to other people I have met previously, and moved to the next target.

This girl had a book with her. So, instead of the usual ""Hi!"" opener, I decided to try something more specific. I said: ""Hi! I see you have a book. Something interesting?""

She looked at me coldly and said: ""It's about feminism. But I don't think you would be interested. It's about how men oppress women. See, you probably already hate me now. You don't have to hide it."" She seemed ready to fight.

I was shocked for a moment. I considered telling her that actually I have signed up for an optional Gender Studies class, but... I realized that I feel pushed to apologize for... I don't even know what. And I refuse that kind of manipulation, on principle. So I just shrugged, and moved away.

I cannot know what happened in her mind, but my guess is that she mentally congratulated herself for proudly defying yet another misogynist.

And I realized that I do actually dislike her. So her prophecy, at least the part about her, became true.

.

This is a more general pattern, not only in situations related to gender or human interaction, but everything. If we believe that something is a danger, then whenever we see it and run away, it feels exactly like having escaped from a real danger. So even if the thing we run away from is completely harmless, even the repeated experience will *not* make us less afraid. The repeated exposure will only convince us that the danger is everywhere, so we should be more careful about it.

.

I can easily imagine that the girl I mentioned had some previous bad experience with some man, or with multiple men. And then she just generalized. And then found a philosophy which, when seen from a proper angle, seemed to fit her idea.

But it is not necessary for something like this to start with a *personal* bad experience. It could also be just something that other people tell you. Or what you read in a book or a web page. As long as you start feeling afraid enough that you start running away from the perceived danger, you are at risk of creating your bubble of reality where you have no positive experience, and a lot of fear.

.

Also, when you give something a name, when you start seeing it as a pattern, it grows big in your mind. The individual experiences that fit the pattern become pieces of a coherent story. The individual experiences that don't fit the pattern become forgotten.

I had a debate later, with a different girl. She asked me: ""Why do so many men hurt women?""

I already knew something about her background, so I asked her: ""Can you tell me a list of all people who significantly hurt *you* personally?"" She said: ""Well, my mother was very abusive. My father doesn't actually hurt me, he just ignores me. I had a horrible (female) classmate at school. I had an abusive (female) boss, and then an abusive (male) boss in a different company. Those are people who hurt me most.""

I reminded her that the majority of people she mentioned were actually women. So why is she so concerned about *men* hurting her, instead of simply *bad people* hurting her? She said she never thought about it this way.

But I think it's easy to understand why. She already had this cultural narrative that men hurt women. She didn't have a corresponding narrative about women hurting women. So whenever a man hurt her somehow, it became an evidence confirming the story. When a woman hurt her, that was... merely a bad *individual*; each one of those women was merely an exception; there was no story to be confirmed. This is why she felt her personal experience confirms the narrative of men hurting women, even when the facts in her life suggested otherwise.

.

When there is a community which, for whatever reason, contains more men then women, it is easy to accuse them of misogyny. You don't have to work hard to make your case. You just throw at them whatever accusation comes to your mind, and when the community tries to defende themselves, you say: ""Yeah, yeah, you have so many clever excuses, but look at yourself and tell me whether you have an equal amount of women. No, you don't. Which proves that I am right and you are not."" (Then, if you are a woman, you can demand from them to make whatever changes you fancy, because as a woman you are totally an expert on how *all* women feel, what *all* women want, etc. And when some woman in the group contradicts you, well, she has internalized misogyny from spending too much time in the misogynistic group, or something like this.)

Now let's look at it from outside. If you are a woman, and there is some community that seems interesting, but people keep telling you that the members of that community hate women, are you more likely to go there and investigate for yourself whether it's really the case, or you just thank them for pointing out the danger? Well, some women *are* adventurous and will go there to find out, but I guess most of them will prefer safety.

This is another self-fulfilling prophecy: Publicly call a group misogynist, because they don't have enough women. Women start avoiding the group. More proof they are misogynist. Ask the group to change according to your whims. They refuse. See, they are not even trying to become more comfortable to women. (But in reality, it's your description that keep increasing the discomfort of the women outside of the group.)

And it gets even worse. If you publicly describe a group as misogynist, then people who *are* misogynist will be more likely to join the group, because you have just advertized it for them. Also, if you start attacking the group *in the name of women*, members will start resenting this argument, and the less enlightened of them may actually start resenting women. Also, after this experience, when a new woman comes, she will be automatically suspect of trying to do the same thing.

(Yes, this text is motivated by GamerGate, but I have seen the same thing done in different places.)

.

Providing positive *role models* seems like a good way to attract women somewhere. Unfortunately, people who try to do this often don't do their homework, and then their results are not convincing.

The usual example of a successful woman in computer science is Ada Lovelace. She is usually hyped as the author of the first computer program ever. I am not a historian, and every time I read Wikipedia, it suggests a different story, so I am just confused on this topic. (Lovelace certainly contributed *somehow*, but whether the program was originally her idea, whether she wrote the original version of the program, or improved someone else's program, or whether she was merely the first one to *publish* the program in an article... different people will give you different answers.) Anyway, Ada Lovelace is often the first and the last example of a woman in computing. So, at best that suggests that women were doing computer science *in a different century*; but what about now?

For me, Grace Hopper would be a more impressive example. She invented COBOL, wrote the first compiler, coined the word ""debugging"". The only problem is that appreciating these achievements requires some pre-existing knowledge of computer science (what is COBOL? what is a compiler? what is debugging?), while ""a first computer program"" is a soundbite you can sell to anyone. That's the problem with trying to describe science to non-scientists; you must find some simple and sometimes misleading explanation.

Maybe a [list of women in videogame industry](http://i.imgur.com/g4EyhNc.jpg) would be more impressive for the young generation. It certainly impressed me. If I were still a teacher, I would totally print this and put in on the classroom door.

On the other hand, suggesting that Zoe Quinn and her Depression Quest are the pinnacle of female contribution to computer science, that's outright offensive to all these women and their hard work. It erases their contributions better than any misogynist could. It feels like the ""exception that proves the rule"" about computers being solely a male hobby.

.

So, if you feel there are not enough women somewhere (e.g. in computer science), DO NOT start a huge media campaign about misogyny because that will probably only *make things worse*. Instead, DO highlight the women who are *already there*; not just one of them, but at least a dozen, so you don't create an image of a lonely woman, but of female contribution being a normal thing.

Of course, this supposes you actually care about women in general, instead of just trying to insert *yourself* as the lonely hero which saves the day. Because in that case, all competition must be ignored. It is only you against the hostile savage hordes. You, and your Patreon account.",Viliam1234,t2_4rlt3,0.81,46,59

1.	Always having to worry about sexual signals some man thinks I appear to be sending, what other men might be thinking about me sexually, whether or not I was alone and/or anyone was within screaming distance, how much I was drinking versus how safe the situation might be in should I end up isolated, and so on and so on and so on, in every evening and nighttime social situation involving men.
2.	People not taking me seriously as an engineer at first, especially other male engineers, and by “at first” I mean, “for months, and sometimes even years.”  
3.	Older men from other cultures where women are of lesser social status than men, who were my superiors professionally.  Always a coin toss what they’d be like, and too often, the toss was bad.
4.	The far inferior design of my body to a man’s in terms of all physical functionality save childbearing.  
5.	How so many other women always just assume I am going to care about and am excited to talk about for a long, long time (or maybe it only *seems* to go on and on) about their anthropomorphized relationships with their pets, their reality TV shows, whatever actors they think are “hot,” their crafting activities, and/or any homeopathic, organic obsessions.

---

I am from Canada. I have been paying a lot of attention lately at work and during my commute. Here are some of my personal findings. I am trying to mix positive and negative things in order to not only display one side.

**Positive**

At my place of work, a lot of the Quality Assurance staff are women. They are often invited to meetings when we are discussing new features so they can learn about them before having to test them.

When they asked a question, not one person in the room interrupted them, ever. They asked more questions than any man in the room and were instrumental in getting good discussions going.

**Negative**

During a meeting someone made a joke about a woman being in ""that time of the month"". In the 5-6 years I have worked, this was the first time I have heard something that could be considered derogatory towards women. I have yet to hear another.

**Positive**

About a year ago a guy at my work announced he was making the change into a woman. At first people thought it was a little weird but were accepting. Now, after her surgery everyone treats her like a woman and has zero problem interacting. It's like she was never a guy.

**Negative**

There were some jokes made about her at first (in private without her around). And she did mention that some people stopped being as friendly.

**Positive**

I have never once seen or heard a woman being ""catcalled"". I know it's strange but it's true. Not once ever.

**Negative**

My girlfriends work once had a woman quit due to comments made by a male employee. The comments were out of line and honestly he should have been fired or severely reprimanded. He is a close friend of the owner (small company) so nothing happened.

**Positive**

I've never seen anyone groped. I've never seen anyone hit their boyfriend or girlfriend on public transit.

During my more partying years with a bunch of good friends we have never attempted to ""rape"" or get girls drunk in order to have sex with them. At least to my knowledge. All girls were always driven home safe. We even had our own place were we used to party all the time where such things could have went down easily.

**Negative**

There are a lot of homeless men downtown. For every 15-20 homeless men I might see one homeless woman. Also downtown are giant advertisements targeting homeless women and trying to help them. I have seen homeless men sleeping under the advertisements that are trying to help homeless women.

**Positive**

There are ads trying to help homeless women.

1077,owwppt,2021-08-03,FeMRADebates,James Damore's memo and its misrepresentation,"I know that this is digging up ancient history (2017) but out of all the culture war nonsense we've seen in recent years, this is the event which most sticks with me. It makes me confused, scared and angry when I think about it. This came up the the comments of an [unrelated post](https://np.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/oqymuy/what_are_your_opinions_of_the_rise_of_superhero/h6fgfx6) but I don't think many people are still reading those threads so I wanted to give this its own post.

Here's the Wikipedia article for anyone who has no idea what I'm talking about:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%27s_Ideological_Echo_Chamber

James Damore was an engineer at Google. He attended a diversity seminar which asked for feedback. He gave his feedback in the form of a memo titled ""Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber.""

This memo discussed how differences in representation of men and women at Google are not necessarily due to sexism. He discussed some of the differences between men and women at a population level and how they might produce the different outcomes seen. He then went on to suggest changes which might increase the representation of women without discriminating against men.

I'm somewhat unclear on how widely he distributed his memo but at some point other people, who took issue with it, shared it with everyone at Google and then the media. 

It was presented by the media as an ""anti-diversity screed"" and it seems that the vast majority of people who heard about his memo accepted the media narrative. It's often asserted that he argued that his female coworkers were too neurotic to work at Google.

The memo is not hard to find online but the first result you are likely to encounter stripped all of the links from the document which removed some of the context, including the definition of ""neuroticism"" he was using, which makes it clear that he is using the term from psychology and another link showing that his claim that women on average report higher neuroticism had scientific support.

Even with this version, you can still see that Damore acknowledges that women face sexism and makes it very clear he is talking about population level trends, not making generalisations about all women. It seems that most people have based their opinions of the memo on out-of-context quotes.

Here is the memo with the links he included:

https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf

Here is the part people take issue with in context:

> **Possible non-bias causes of the gender gap in tech​**

> At Google, we’re regularly told that implicit (unconscious) and explicit biases are holding women 
back in tech and leadership. Of course, men and women experience bias, tech, and the 
workplace differently and we should be cognizant of this, but it’s far from the whole story. 
 
> On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways. These differences aren’t just 
socially constructed because: 

> * They’re universal across human cultures 
> * They often have clear biological causes and links to prenatal testosterone 
> * Biological males that were castrated at birth and raised as females often still identify  
and act like males 
> * The underlying traits are highly heritable 
> * They’re exactly what we would predict from an evolutionary psychology perspective 

> Note, I’m not saying that all men differ from all women in the following ways or that these 
differences are “just.” I’m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men 
and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why 
we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership. Many of these differences 
are small and there’s significant overlap between men and women, so you can’t say anything 
about an individual given these population level distributions.

[<graph sketches illustrating the above point>](https://i.imgur.com/9dhMovs.png)

> **Personality differences**

> [Women, on average, have more​:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_psychology#Personality_traits)
 
> * Openness directed towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas. Women generally 
also have a stronger interest in ​[people rather than things](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00320.x)​, relative to men (also 
interpreted as ​[empathizing vs. systemizing​](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathising%E2%80%93systemising_theory)). 

> These two differences in part explain why women relatively prefer jobs in social 
or ​artistic areas. More men may like coding because it requires systemizing and even 
within SWEs, comparatively more women work on front end, which deals with both 
people and aesthetics. 

> * Extraversion expressed as gregariousness rather than assertiveness. Also, higher 
agreeableness. 

> This leads to women generally having a harder time negotiating salary, asking for 
raises, speaking up, and leading. Note that these are just average differences 
and there’s overlap between men and women, but this is seen solely as a 
women’s issue. This leads to exclusory programs like Stretch and swaths of men 
without support. 

> * [Neuroticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism)​ ​(higher anxiety, lower stress tolerance). 

> This may contribute to the higher levels of anxiety women report on Googlegeist 
and to the lower number of women in high stress jobs. 

He starts by acknowledging that women do face sexism.

> At Google, we’re regularly told that implicit (unconscious) and explicit biases are holding women 
back in tech and leadership. Of course, men and women experience bias, tech, and the 
workplace differently and we should be cognizant of this, but it’s far from the whole story.

He then makes it totally clear he's not making generalisations about all women.

> Note, I’m not saying that all men differ from all women in the following ways or that these 
differences are “just.” I’m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men

we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership. **Many of these differences 
are small and there’s significant overlap between men and women, so you can’t say anything 
about an individual given these population level distributions**.

The word ""Neuroticism"" in the memo was a hyperlink to the Wikipedia article defining the term:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism

> Not to be confused with Neurosis.

> In the study of psychology, neuroticism has been considered a fundamental personality trait. For example, in the Big Five approach to personality trait theory, 

""Women, on average, have more​"" is also a hyperlink to a Wikipedia article (with citations) backing up his claims:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_psychology#Personality_traits

> Cross-cultural research has shown population-level gender differences on the tests measuring sociability and emotionality. **For example, on the scales measured by the Big Five personality traits women consistently report higher neuroticism, agreeableness, warmth and openness to feelings, and men often report higher assertiveness and openness to ideas**. Nevertheless, there is significant overlap in all these traits, so an individual woman may, for example, have lower neuroticism than the majority of men.

I accept that the point he was making contradicts the deeply held beliefs of some people. I respect their right to argue that he was wrong, both morally and factually. I respect their right to argue that was so wrong that he deserved consequences. I disagree with them but they have every right to make that case.

What troubles me is that they didn't make that case. They didn't confront Damore's argument. They deliberately misrepresented it. They had access to the original document. They must have read it to be upset by it. They knew what it actually said and they lied about it. This was not just the people who leaked it out of Google. It was the media, journalists whose job it is to present the truth. Sure we expect them to introduce their own bias but that's meant to be in how they spin the truth, not through outright lies.

They set out to destroy someone for saying something they didn't like but they obviously had the clarity to recognise that average people would find Damore's actual argument totally benign. Most people can acknowledge that, at a population level, men and women have different temperaments and preferences. That this might lead to different outcomes, again at the population level, is not an idea which it outside the Overton window. So, rather than denounce his actual arguments, they accused him of something they knew people would get angry at, sexism against women. 

The most troubling part is that it worked. People accepted the lie. Even when they had access to the actual memo, which explicitly denounces the position he is accused of taking, they accepted the misinformation.",ParanoidAgnostic,t2_brjgh,0.9,57,240

#Collected Assertions
Last updated: 3/29/14

**Mainstream Men's Rights Advocates believe the following:**

* MRAs advocate for a ban on all male and female Genital Mutilation (circumcision)

* Appropriate punishment for people who knowingly and maliciously report a ***provably false*** claim of rape.

* Subset of above; anonymity for those accused of rape (for both sexes), as well as those accusing, until conviction.

* Gender-neutral approach to custody disputes.

* Gender-neutral approach to domestic violence reports.

* Gender-neutral legal definition of rape.

* Greater empathy towards male suffering and issues.

* Gender-neutral approach to prison sentencing.

* Fighting the concept of male disposability.

* Men have a unique experience of gender which is generally not accounted for by traditional or feminist notions of gender.

* The Mens Rights Movement is pro-equality. The Mens Rights Movement supports equality and social rights for people of all genders, but we focus primarily on the often neglected needs of men, boys, and their children.

* The Mens Rights Movement is not anti-woman. Being pro-equality does not mean being anti-woman or anti-man.

* The Mens Rights Movement does not wish to remove women's rights, or even fight against women's rights. Instead, we simply believe that men deserve equal rights.

* [Controversial] The Mens Rights Movement supports the LGBT communities, and universal equal rights for people independent of gender, ethnicity, gender assignment and sexual orientation. The MRM also recognizes that there are already many communities devoted to these topics, which is why they are not common in MR discussion. There is a great deal of intersection between Gay Rights and Men's Rights, for example, and such topics do appear on occasion. But the lack of frequency of these types of topics should not be taken as an indicator that they are not accepted.

* Recognition of social systems wherein women do enjoy Privilege equal to or superior to men.

**Mainstream Feminists believe the following:**

>* There should be appropriate punishment of convicted rapists

>* Rape victims should be taken seriously (i.e. no victim-blaming)

>* There should be acceptance of different body shapes (and no, this does not mean you have to be attracted to them all. Women can be healthy at a size you don't personally find attractive)

>* There should be acknowledgement that women are capable people who operate independently of men

>* Women should be able to obtain safe and accessible abortions

>* Women should be able to obtain safe and accessible birth control options (perhaps this could be added to the MRA side too - I see no one has mentioned it)

>* Women should be able to obtain paid maternity leave (again, perhaps this could be added to the MRA side)

>* If we are going to talk about the empathy gap, there needs to be acknowledgment of the respect gap

>* Women should have their emotions/feelings be taken seriously without being labelled insane/crazy/hysterical

>* Women should have the sexual harassment that they face be addressed and taken seriously (i.e. no more ""You should be thankful"")

>* There should be a gender-neutral legal definition of rape

>* Women have a unique experience of gender which is generally not accounted for by traditional notions of gender, nor is it inherently linked to child-bearing

>* There should be acknowledgement that there exists gendered slurs and can be problematic (e.g. whore, bitch, etc)

>* Women should be able to express their sexuality without fear of slut-shaming (or, where applicable, virgin shaming - it does happen to a few girls as well!)

>* There should be acknowledgement and confrontation of the discrimination that women face in the workplace (particularly in STEM fields)

>* There should be further investigation into the pay gap where it is not clear where the discrepancy lies, as well as investigating why women may choose to opt for lower paying fields

>* Connected to the above, but there should be acknowledgement that a lot of the work women do is typically not paid/underpaid (i.e. child care, house care) and disrespected/unappreciated 

>* There should be proper enforcement of child support payments 

>* There should be a removal of the stigma of receiving child support/alimony 

>* Feminists support LGBTQ communities

>* There should be proper regulation of prostitution/porn industries to protect workers

>* Rape kits should be tested (I would think MRAs would want this too)

>* There should be more extensive portrayals of women in media depictions ",SocratesLives,t2_c25rp,0.69,17,84

1084,3pfxua,2015-10-20,FeMRADebates,[DISCUSSION/RANT] What's the big deal with abortion waiting periods?,"I saw [this Onion article](http://www.theonion.com/article/states-abortion-waiting-period-allows-women-explor-51606) over on /r/NorthCarolina and it got me wondering.

Why are waiting periods before abortions such a huge deal?  I see this issue brought up a lot as an example of ""Patriarchy"" and such but I just can't see it.  Its a pain in the ass, I guess.  But it's not oppression. 

Now, I'm not saying this to be combative or antagonistic.  I wouldn't be *happy* to be wrong, here (if I'm wrong then the world is an objectively worse place than I thought), but I am very receptive to being wrong.  I also don't want to be misrepresented.  I'm not pro-life.  Hell, I'm barely pro-choice.  I'm pro abortion, honestly.  I think most people having kids right now shouldn't be.  And, obviously, cases where time is of the medical essence aren't a part of this topic.

Here's my perspective:  I'm a dude. I have never had/been a part of an abortion.  Closest I've been is my wife telling me about accompanying a friend to hers (so I am, in some part, aware that those places are de-fucking-pressing).  What I have done is had a vasectomy.  Which is kinda in the same ballpark, I think.

When I had mine done, I had to come in before I could book the appointment and watch a couple of videos on the procedure and a few ""are you sure?"" talks.  I booked the soonest appointment, which was two weeks away.  So I waited my two weeks, informed the people at work that I had to inform, and got that shit taken care of.  Bear in mind that this was at a Naval hospital, long waits are the norm.  I would be interested to know if anyone's normal people doctors had similar policies.

What I'm saying is:  I was pressured like crazy during those two weeks to cancel from my own self doubt, the gory details of the procedure, the people around me crying ""you can't just have one kid!"", etc...  but I still definitely had that shit done.  

That's what I'm really getting at.  Why is having to come to the PP office twice such a huge deal?  I understand that sometimes that 24-72 hour period can push some cases over the limit of what is legal timelines.  So book your abortion earlier?  I'm kinda rambling at this point.

**TL;DR**  Why is the idea of abortion waiting periods such a huge deal?  Barring clinic workers being dicks (""here's your involuntary sonogram. LOOK AT IT"" kind of shit), why is it such a huge deal to have to go to the abortion clinic twice?

**EDIT**  Who said there weren't any feminists in this sub?!

So I did some more digging after the wonderful response to this topic and found an interesting couple of PDFs.  

http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_MWPA.pdf

We can see several things in this document, but for the sake of formatting, I'm just gonna throw a few things out there as I think of them.

1)/u/strangetime brought up Texas as a example of having to drive 200 miles or more to get to an abortion clinic.  This is totally true.  But what isn't mentioned is that in Texas if you live 100 miles or more from a clinic, that consultation is waived.  Leaving one visit to perform the abortion.

2) 13 states in the union require ""in person"" counseling before the waiting period begins.  13 states.  Anyone who recognizes me and my posting has seen me mention my disabled veteran status.  Medical cannabis is the only thing so far that has had any effect on my PTSD/depression symptoms. 27 states don't have medical cannabis, including North Carolina, where I live.  Does that mean that these states hate veterans?

3)[This paper](http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_MA.pdf) deals  with regulations surrounding medication abortions.  Just 18 states  in which you can not do the ""consult"" over the phone.  This further shows that these ""poor women can't make multiple trips to clinics"" arguments don't indicate a national campaign against women.  Just a group of powerful douchebags trying to score jesus-points by stopping abortions.

The laws that are currently in place are shitty.  But they aren't nearly as widespread and all encompassing as some people would have you believe.  I have a feeling this issue is akin so a few other women's issues, ginned up by a particular tribe of feminism to create a ""war on women"".",Kurridevilwing,t2_c7jp5,0.67,6,106

My take:

It doesn't seem like these men are actually happy in this relationship (except maybe Travis), I think they're settling for this because the alternative is no romantic/sexual contact at all. I'm also going to go out on a limb and say that jealousy was the primary reason for the child abuse (despite the culprit saying it was the child waking him up while sleeping - I don't buy that). I'm not against poly relationships, but this example shows how easily they can become dysfunctional. It's a bit unusual to see one woman living with four boyfriends. Historically, polygamy has been the reverse of that, with one man having multiple wives.

1089,a7pgj5,2018-12-19,FeMRADebates,Jeremy Corbyn denies 'stupid woman' jibe at Theresa May,"There's a debate in the UK at the moment about something Jeremy Corbyn, Leader of the Opposition, is [alleged to have muttered](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46619689) to the Prime Minister, Theresa May, in Parliament today.  He's been accused by many people of calling her a ""stupid woman"" under his breath.  He denies this and says he muttered ""stupid people"" in response to what he saw as irresponsible behaviour in Parliament.  I wonder if this would trigger an interesting discussion on here.

&#x200B;

Do you think saying ""stupid people"" is significantly less bad than saying ""stupid woman""?

&#x200B;

Do you think the fact that it's routine to make fun of other political leaders, as I believe May was doing to Corbyn immediately before he muttered whatever he muttered, makes a difference here?

&#x200B;

Do you think that using language like ""stupid woman"" deters women from entering politics, as many have claimed?

&#x200B;

Do you think that the reaction to his alleged insult influences women's choices?

1090,1xtl8p,2014-02-13,FeMRADebates,"As a trans woman, I feel like I am not welcomed in most communities, but especially in the Men's Rights Movement. I would think MRAs would be the strongest supporters of trans* issues, but they aren't. Why is this?","Hello. I hope I am doing this right. I would like to have a civil discussion on why, from what I've seen, a majority of MRAs do not take too kindly to trans* people, especially trans women. 

First, I would like to say that I do not think MRAs are blatantly against trans* issues. I have seen them say it is wrong to kill trans* people, for example. But after that, it starts to get murky. I am used to people in general not liking or understanding trans* people, but I am always shocked when I see MRAs doing the same things. I would think that logically they would be the biggest supporters, since violence against MtF persons is extremely high. Yet, just like the general public, I see them lash out, saying we aren't real women, or how we are liars and disgusting if we don't tell our partners that we used to have male parts, etc. I have seen comments by MRAs that say they think trans* women should be charged with a crime if they do not tell men they used to be a man...this is very hurtful.

A little background on me. I am a trans woman and have been officially since I was 18 and able to start hormone treatments and move out of my parents house. I had surgery and changed my name a few years later. I am 28 now and for the past few years I have dated and slept with a lot of men who never knew that I used to have male parts. 

I feel I do not have to tell them this; this defeats the purpose of me being a true woman. In addition, if they can't tell I used to be a man, then why should I tell them? I'm still the same person they know, love, and find sexually attractive, so what exactly am I harming by keeping the past in the past? The most common arguments I see:

- You should tell them because they might want kids later.

My answer to that is, not everyone wants kids. I know plenty of women who do not want kids and they still have boyfriends who accept that and do not care. Also, you can adopt. Also, what if the man I am sleeping with is just a fling?

- It's a lie and you should be honest.

Everyone has a lie or truth they would rather not tell their SO. I understand being honest about things like mental problems, addictions, STDs, and the like, but what I used to have between my legs is really not going to affect you in any way. Please tell me how it would affect you? Every time I ask this, I never get a direct response, all I get is the same ""it's just dishonest"". 

- You might end up dead if they find out later.

This one scares me. Because for one thing it is wrong. Being honest does not mean they won't attack me. I have had many trans* friends beat up for being honest, long before the first kiss even took place. For another thing, it is victim blaming. Really, why would anyone think it is acceptable to beat up or kill someone just because of what they used to have? I am not saying you couldn't be upset or mad, but violence? 

This is another reason I am surprised MRAs are not more supportive of trans* issues. Because we need to stop violence. We need to stop subtly telling society that it's okay to get mad enough at trans* women to hurt them if they 'lie' to you. 

This is not an issue with trans* men. Do you ever see women complaining or threatening to kick someone's ass if they found out the man they were dating used to be a girl? No, you don't, because this is a men's issue, and it is bad.

**edit: I have to go for a while but I'll be back later to finish discussion**

Her, a fanatical pentecostal born again virgin from America. Him, a working class Agnostic from Britain. (Female=V Male=M) M-So Samantha is really up for joining a gym here and i would love to surprise her with complete sets of workout gear. I have no idea whats comfortable or practical though. What do you wear, as a point of reference?

V-as far as workout clothes...i remember seeing sam in the free t-shirts they'd give us at school and bermuda shorts.

V-is buying workout clothes really the best way to go?

V-most girls tend to feel offended, as if you're pushing them into working out.

M-ordinarily i'd agree with you. but without prompting she's said joining a gym is something she wants. Apparently this internship has highlighted the need for an expected appearance? Anyway, she's a student with limited funds, so if i can help out with something i always will. lol it's not like it will be her only present, don't worry.

M-i don't think she's telling me i stink when she buys me cologne.

V-never that. Men don't read onto things like we do

V-now if it was deodorant, both genders can agree it's insulting

M-I object to your idea. Sexist, generalizing nonsense. there is no reason why thought patterns should automatically be assumed as different because of gender. I didn't think you were that sort of person :/

V-sure, go ahead and label me like you've done with the rest of samanthas friends

M-I will. If you're going to tell me that men and women will view the same thing differently. And they'll do so simply because of their gender.

V-I apologize if i offended you, i was just projecting my feelings onto the scenario if i received gym clothes as a gift

M-that's insulting.

V- I'm starting to think you're too sensitive then.

M-no, i'm liberal. i believe in gender equality and equal rights. i believe to treat both genders as equal, they must be seen as the same. To highlight personally conceived differences between the two only enforces other peoples negative stereotypes. Equality must be embraces fully, or it is non existent. Further to that, if a person dares assume a persons thoughts based on nothing but their gender, then that person is free to judge me solely on my gender. Which is insulting. Genitals do not dictate who i am, same as yours do not dictate you.

M-rant over lol. that's my stance though.

V- You can't write , ""rant over"" if i didn't get to express my side

V-I already wrote i apologize..

M- your side was made by saying ""men don't read into things like we do"".

V-I am not trying to dictate how you think.

M-no i know :) but you're generalizing me simply because i have a dick.

V-that was my stance on it. And it's not just because we're anatomically different. I've befriended plenty of men to know we do not think the same way. Society has molded us to think differently to our counterparts.

V-so how dare you think i'd place the value of your thoughts being different from mine because of your dick.

M-very true. i'd grant you that many people act, and i do mean 'act' a certain way as they feel that is the social norm and what is expected of them to fit in. But, someone who can't see or think past that must surely be regarded as close minded and naive. If however a person is a free thinker, capable of independent thought (and so some would argue the more intelligent) and were able to realize that gender is not a stereotype, a system of thinking or a social grouping...

M...then it is only fair that they take offense to the fact that someone believes that because of their gender they, and all people of that gender, must think the same.

M-like you said, you were projecting your own experience. Fine. On your own limited interaction with the male population of the world that's been your experience. But it is the minority. The majority should not be judged on your interaction with the minority.

V-Look sweetheart you're annoying me with your judgements... i'm ending this conversation. Come to any conclusions you'd like of me. I don't care about them,

M-Just so we're clear, your bottom line, darling, is that men and women think differently, regardless of the individual?

M-this is all going on reddit. i would love to see what other women think, as they all, apparently, think the same..

--no response has since been given--

what are your thoughts? Will sexism and the divide continue to exist while people seek to find and highlight the differences? Or are they in fact genuine and must be accepted? In an example of buisness if you choose to acknowledge differences, there is a best way of doing something and another way. If someones gender influences their thinking, then can they be as productive in the workplace?... GO!

As a warning some people might get offended by this post but I feel it's important to be able to have stimulating discussions without putting personal feelings in the mix. Okay now that the disclosure is out of the way let's dig in. What is Gender Equality? Some people might argue that it's the belief that both genders are supposedly equal in every action or way, but is that really true though? Now don't get me wrong I'm all about treating everyone as equals and all that but I'm also not naive as to turn a blind eye to the fact that there are somethings one gender can do that the other can't whether it's frowned upon by society or just flat out incapable of doing. Now I'm going to do my best to take a juxtaposition on the matter that way there is equal criticism where it is needed. I think it's interesting how women everywhere are quick to lobby for gender equality and want to be treated as men are but then in that same breath when push comes to shove they excuse themselves from certain circumstances by saying ""That's a man's job"", call me crazy but should they not be able to do that ""man's job"" since they want to be viewed as equal? I saw a woman slap her husband the other day and I remember thinking to myself that if he had done that he would immediately be vilified and labeled as a monster. Now I honestly don't think people should be hitting each other in the first place much less a member of the opposite sex, I just find it interesting that it's okay for a woman to strike a man and no one bats an eye, but as soon as a man hits a woman, she goes from being a so called strong and proud woman lobbying for gender equality to being a victim and everyone loses their minds. Where is the gender equality in that? I might have missed it somewhere. Now it's not just physicality that I'm speaking about so bear with me. Just the other day at my job, one of my female coworkers walked into the men's room and no one even blinked, but I guarantee that if a male had walked into the women's room he would have been labeled as a pervert and scorned, he probably would have been fired. Where is the equality in that? Again, I might have missed it. I was standing in line at the grocery store last week, I'm paying just like everyone else and this woman cuts in front of me so I confronted her about it. She proceeded to tell me that women should always be first because I'm a man that can wait a little longer. I remembered laughing because I found it so interesting that she was a perfect example of one of those women that are all about gender equality but manipulate that cause for their own personal convenience. Where is the equality? In today's society it's completely socially acceptable to have a ""Women only"" gathering but as soon as males have a ""Men only"" we're labeled as sexist and it becomes a matter of heated controversy. Where is the equality? I'm not trying to be difficult, I'm just trying to understand why people whine and complain about establishing gender equality but then when it comes down to it, one gender clearly can manipulate the cause and get away with it while the other gender can't. I was having a discussion with some friends earlier and even my own girlfriend doesn't think there is any true gender equality. My apologies if anyone is sensitive enough to be offended.
