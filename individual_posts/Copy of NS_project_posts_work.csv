**integralds**

So let's take a step back. Someone precisely define the GWG. We're all econs here, we can do this.

**commentsrus**

reg wage female, b_female < 0, p < 0.05

TADA

and then spend decades wondering why those results

**besttrousers**

Are there any proposed differences that aren't due to 1.) Endowments 2.) Preferences 3.) Discrimination?
or does that capture the sources

**commentsrus**

Endowments. Nice

**besttrousers**

hahaha

**gorbachev** 

btw, succinct definition of the GWG

""Whatever component of the difference between male and female wages that is unfair""

**integralds**

I'm not sure I can regress for ""unfair""

**Besttrousers**

eh

It's unfair that women have to go through labor and delivery

but that's not like society's problem

like get rid of discrimination, and you'd still see some GWG due to that

**reg_monkey**

I would say take an equal MPL woman and man and the man's wage - the woman's wage is the GWG

**commentsrus**

@besttrousers typical economist. unless (3) includes social pressure, you missed social pressure.  

and i mean social pressure beyond what shapes preferences

**reg_monkey**

Oh wait that isn't good because of choice variables

**besttrousers**

good point @commentsrus

**commentsrus**

obviously women can choose to do certain things

**integralds**

reg_monkey: I think that's close. Tack on the requisite expected discounted value stuff and I think it's really close. 

besttrousers' answer is also close.

**reg_monkey**

My problem is choice productivity variables like education.

Bad incentives might lead women to not get education

**gorbachev**

I'm joking w/ the definition, but the point = what we choose to care about in the difference between male and female wages is semi-secretly a normative decision

**commentsrus**

care? i just want to know all of the causes.

**integralds**

besttrousers, a wrinkle: should we think of preferences as exogenous for this question?

**ponderay**

But besttrousers isn't the whole debate around the GWG about how much discrimination matters?

**besttrousers**

Yeah @reg_monkey. Like it's [interesting in my GWG data mock-up](https://np.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/4ec0s6/the_silver_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/d204bpy/?context=4) how the wage gap due to discrimination is 20%, but the *realized* gap was like 25%

**commentsrus**

@ponderay i see a shift toward trying to figure out how much social pressure matters

**reg_monkey**

It's also very important for welfare considerations

GWG preventing capital accumulation is BAD

**integralds**

I mean I'm a macro person so I'm totally okay with taking preferences as exogenous, but I can conceive of reasons why we might not want to do that. Do more boys go into math because they have a pref for it, or are those prefs nudged by society/etc?

**besttrousers**

That's definitely a wrinkle @integralds - especially given @commentsrus point about social pressure

it is GOD DAMN impossible to find girls clothes that aren't pink

**commentsrus**

@ponderay e.g., why women take care of kids and do housework more. or go into less quantitative fields.
part is preferences, but those can shaped by social forces, and norms can also induce one to consciously choose something

Becker did some work on endogenous preferences but i know nothing

**besttrousers**

also even super dumb norms are stable with third party punishment. Bendor and Swistak 2000 show that any behavior is sustainable

**gorbachev**

dem folk theorems

**besttrousers**

@commentsrus there was a whole RSF working group on endogenous preferences in the 90s/00s

with Akerlof, Camerer, Fehr, Gintis etc.

**ponderay**

I guess when I'm thinking of discrimination I was lumping those sorts of things in.

**reg_monkey**

@integralds I think I got one definition I like. Take a man and woman with the same amount of TFP. Wage the man makes - wage the woman makes

**besttrousers**

still gotta measure some unobservables though

**commentsrus**

@besttrousers i totally know what RSF is...

**besttrousers**

russell sage foundation

**commentsrus**

this? https://muse.jhu.edu/book/38525

**besttrousers**

@commentsrus I think that's one of the products of the working group

working group used to have a webpage, but that was like a decade ago

**ponderay**

reg_monkey how the hell do you identify TFP then?

seems weird to just match residuals

**gorbachev**

reg_monkey, suppose they have the same MPL

or face the exact same wage setting function

suppose no taste discrimination occurs at any level

suppose women have lower MPLs due to child bearing

should we say there's a GWG?

**reg_monkey**

@ponderay I mean I don't think you can ID MPL either. I just wanted an ""innate potential"" to be the same

Ahh you're right gorby

**gorbachev**

(hashtag secretly normative. some will say no b/c paid same W given MPL, others will say is unfair to punish for child bearing even if it lowers MPL)

**mrdannyocean**

>also even super dumb norms are stable with third party punishment. Bendor and Swistak 2000 show that any behavior is sustainable

yeah this should be more well known game-theory wise

**besttrousers**

it's a neat finding!

**integralds**

I need to not write down DSGE models in chat.

**mrdannyocean**

too many econ types think 'everything will trend towards a nice efficient equilibrium over time' on every subject

but dumb norms are often sticky

nash equilibriums are just stable

Nothing makes them inherently efficient

**integralds**

I have in mind a multi-stage model involving education choice, job choice, and maternity leave; grind out the competitive equilibrium; there should be a way to define an ""excess"" GWG.

Then take it to data.

See, this is how macros think.

Micros would just hunt for exogenous or semi-exogenous variation and MHE their way to an estimate.

The average salary today is approximately $59,000. Again both numbers fluctuate a bit dependent upon the source but appear to be roughly accurate. 

So my question for those who are more well versed in economics than I: 

In 70 years, we saw the average worker's salary increase 18x from what it was in 1950. Therefore, 70 years from now, is it correct to assume that, while many different factors are at play and the economic conditions won't line up exactly, that the average worker salary could be in excess of $1 million?

I can't imagine a scenario where salaries are AVERAGING $1 million and the currency remains stable. At what point does the devaluation of the currency make a difference and could there be a point in the future where there will have to be a ""reset"" of sorts due to currency issues?",Skyab23,t2_2o1osu4p,0.76,608,321

(Do not counting Executives making XX mil $)

I have not seen this phenomenon almost anywhere elese, in the developed world. In Europe the wages are more evenly distributed, so there are no such low lows and not that high salaries.

237,16ho9oh,2023-09-13,AskEconomics,Wouldn’t it be beneficial for capitalism to provide equal opportunities for everyone?,"I know capitalism hasn’t been a relevant word for academic economists for a long time, so I am using that word for whatever the current economic system is, because it is largely based on free market principles. 

I am debating with a libertarian in my college / university. My professors will be watching our debate so I want to make sure my arguments hold weight. We had a pre debate discussion to get to know each other’s positions.

He argued against affirmative action (reservation in india), free education, universal health care, and anything which is related to gender and social equity. He said that government intervention in the free market hurts economic growth. His point is that, without government intervention, people will rise to the top based on their merits. He concluded that this system has been beneficial for the general public since Industrial Revolution because even tho free trade and free markets have increased inequality but on an average, the average Joe today is much better off than the average Joe before Industrial Revolution. He showed me a bunch of studies from reputed sources like imf, world bank, etc to back his claims.

While I agree with a lot of that, I disagree about the part where he said equal opportunities would hurt economic growth.

My argument is that there is systematic discrimination as well as bad luck is inhibiting people from reaching their full potential. So his system of meritocracy isn’t the most efficient way of recognising merit.

I pointed out that generally there is not much difference in cognitive / intellectual abilities between people of different genders, races, religions and sexuality. But there is systematic discrimination against these people which is inhibiting their potential. 

For example: Sexism, racism and queer phobia in office / work places leads to women, people of colour and queer people having less power, safety and respect in those places and thus leading them to quit the work place entirely, or if they stay, they have a hard time being themselves and showing their potential, network, and get their works and talents recognised. Thus, the current system of meritocracy is biased.

My argument is that reducing these systematic discrimination will help economic growth because these people will be more likely to work, there will be more people working on the next cancer cure, the next technological breakthrough, basically higher Innovation in general. And that will help improve the system of meritocracy. So it would be beneficial for the system that is generally defined as “capitalism” in this context, would benefit from reduction in that systematic discrimination.

Also free education and healthcare means people who otherwise could be very productive couldn’t afford education because of circumstances would lose out on so much potential economic growth. Similarly, someone got into an accident or has a mental health issue but can’t afford care, it’s inhibiting their productivity, thus it would be better for “capitalism” (TM) to provide these people with the care they need so they can get back to being more productive.

So I want to know if my arguments hold weight and my question is, wouldn’t it be beneficial for capitalism to provide equal opportunities (equity) for everyone?",AmaanMemon6786,t2_beq6r8cj,0.38,0,14

244,8dl7bg,2018-04-20,AskEconomics,Where Did Gender Pay Gap Come From?,"My friend Tong and I had an interesting discussion about the phenomenon of gender differences in social status. He proposes that the study of sociology has not discovered an convincing enough reason why the human society is male-dominant. 

The assumption to continue the discussion is that there is no statistical significance in the cognitive ability between man and women, but there are statistically significant physiological difference between the two gender. He brings up a good point that the concept of physical competence is multi-dimensioned, and we cannot simply claim that one gender is superior in physical ability to the other; for example, the typical male body has a larger muscle mass than the female body, but at the same time females generally have a higher pain tolerance than male and are more flexible. So why are females in a relatively disadvantageous position in the society compared to males?

I proposed that the majority of employment in the traditional industry (goods-producing, agriculture) are blue collar jobs, which involves in performing physical labor. Since the male body composition with more muscle mass than female gives them an advantage in carrying out these tasks, males are compensated more than females since they are generally more efficient in performing physical labor (doing more in a fixed amount of time). With the increase of automation and use of robots in manufacturing industries, we can see that the percentage of jobs that require physical labor is decreasing and at the same time the gender pay gap is decreasing as well.

However, we can see that the rate of change don’t quite correspond perfectly. In other words, goods-producing jobs are decreasing at the faster rate than the gender pay gap is decreasing. About 21% of goods-producing jobs disappeared in 2016 compared to 2006, but the gender pay gap only decreased for about 4.7% during that time. This means that while women are participating in the jobs that require mostly mental/cognitive capability, they are still compensated less than men.

Finance would arguably be a good example, since there is almost no physical labor involved in performing daily duties of finance. Success in the financial industry depends on abstract problem solving, analyzing patterns and critical thinking which are important aspects of cognitive ability, and female should be as competent as male. Looking at the above statistics, we can see that even though women make up a fairly large percentage of the workforce in finance (surpassing 50% in some branches), they becoming increasingly rare up the ranks. 

A similar case can be made about Asian people in Silicon Valley. While 47% of all Silicon Valley jobs are held by Asians, they only make up about 25% of the executives. Similar phenomenon exists in Wall Street. But this can be explained by the following: a lot of the Asian people who work in Silicon Valley/Wall Street are first or second generation immigrants, and it is definitely understandable that to make it to the top of the corporate ladder technical competence is only one aspect. The cultural differences which affects networking abilities and interpersonal skills could be used to explain the absence of Asian in executive positions, and as more second and third generation Asian enters the workforce with higher degree of assimilation into the US culture the number of Asian executives and managers has been increasing.

A significant difference between ethnic group comparison and gender comparison is the underlying distribution of resources. When a person of certain ethnic group attains a higher social status and thus gains control to more resources in the society, they would generally funnel the resources back to their own ethnic group. This can be done in a various of fashions, such as investment, charity, or simply by just having children. While when it comes to gender comparison, if a person of certain gender gains control to more resources, it is not certain that either of the gender group would benefit from those resources. Women or men usually find a partner who is of the opposite gender, and raise offsprings and share resources together as a family. This could explain why gender conflicts would never be as violent and unforgiving as ethnic conflicts, but it does not explain why one gender would hold the advantage in terms of social status to the other, as any individual of either gender groups still does have the same motivation to control as many resources as possible.

Many people have attributed female’s disadvantage to the patriarchal mentality, gender stereotypes, and traditional societal roles for either genders. While I agree that this is definitely one of the reasons that contribute to the phenomenon, it is unclear whether this is the only and most important one. As the human society becomes increasingly complex and competitive, persons and organizations who favor these gender stereotypes over efficiency and competence will gradually be eliminated, as evidenced by the increase of women in leadership roles in the last 30 years or so. And it does not explain why this mentality and stereotypes developed in the first place.

It shocked me. In America the medium salary is 60k/year and to be rich/earn a lot means a salary of six figures...
So I was shocked because in Italy the medium salary is 30k/year. But in reality in the south, where there is a lot of exploitation, 30k a year can only be a dream. In Italy we don't have a MINIMUN SALARY, and the recent legislative proposal of a minimun salary of 9€ per hour was REJECTED. (If I am not wrong in America the medium salary per hour is 30$). Here a lot of families survive off a salary of 1500€ a month. Here for a 16/17/18 years old it's not normal to work, because you can even be paid 25/30€ a day for 12 hours of work. And there is no tip culture.
How can we explain such differences in salarys? 
The € and the $ are almost the same in value, health care can cost a lot in the US, but alone cannot justify this difference. The other main difference is the education system, that in the US COSTS A LOT, here in Italy, in a public university, the fees can hardly reach 4k/year. But the cost of life isn't pretty much the same? (At least for what I know, and what I ve seen of social medias).
AMERICANS please explain to me, how do you spend your money, and how a person with 60k a year is not rich, but normal.
Also Americans say that its impossible for them to buy a house, if I am well informed you spend at least 400k for a house but its also common to spend 1million or more in bigger cities. Here normal people spend around 200k or 300k maximum. But in reality American houses cost so much because they are HUGE, they have at least 2 floors, a backyard, a garage etc. Here you spend 200/300k for a fucking flat. If you compare prices for m² in Italy it's around 2000€/m². In the US the medium price is around 1600$/m².

But that all changed when the Japanese bombers attacked. While men fought on the frontlines in WWII, it was the Rosie the Riveters back home who filled the labor gap, making the bombs, airplanes, and other industrial products fueling both the war effort and home life. Over six million women entered the workforce by the end of World War II, and by 1945, they made up almost 37 percent of the workforce. By the early 1990s, the labor force participation rate of prime working-age women—those between the ages of 25 and 54—reached just over 74 percent, compared with roughly 93 percent for prime working-age men.

As women increased their education and joined industries and occupations formerly dominated by men, the gap in earnings between women and men began to close significantly. The rise in women's labor force participation dramatically increased the labor supply causing wages to stagnate in America. Over the entire 34-year period between 1979 and 2013, the hourly wages of middle-wage workers were stagnant, rising just 6 percent—less than 0.2 percent per year. This wage growth, in fact, occurred only because wages grew in the late 1990s when labor markets got tight enough—unemployment, for instance, fell to 4 percent in 1999 and 2000—to finally deliver across-the-board hourly wage growth. The wages of middle-wage workers were totally flat or in decline over the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, except for the late 1990s. The wages of low-wage workers fared even worse, falling 5 percent from 1979 to 2013.

Workers received lower pay in occupations with a higher share of female workers. A study found that [a 10 percentage-point increase in the female share of an occupation's workforce leads to an 7% decline in average female wage, and a 7.7% decline in average male wage, measured contemporaneously.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927537121001378#:~:text=I%20estimate%20that%20a%2010,average%20male%20wage%2C%20measured%20contemporaneously)

Today, we live in a society where both parents must work to support a family. Gone are the days when one income could support a family. So did wages really stagnate when women joined the workforce?",Alarmed_Pilot_5802,t2_lex7yjud,0.83,40,4

I was recently discussing the gender pay gap with a friend of mine (guy) who recently became a feminist. He's a smart guy, but he and I don't see eye to eye on this issue. (Shocker!)

Now. obviously the gender pay gap is over exaggerated by most liberals, as it fits their agenda, but it seems clear to most rational individuals that a large portion of the pay gap can be accounted for by decisions made by laborers.

Some models state that the adjusted pay gap is 7.1%; however, models that attempt to account for the cost of fringe benefits as a total compensation produce an adjusted pay gap of 3.6%, and I am under the school of thought that this figure is accurate.

However, it is the 3.6% pay gap that concerns me. However, some sources say that this 3.6% is something not to worry about. Others say that it is overt discrimination. 

It seems obvious to me that men and women are perfect substitutes in the labor market. So if women were getting paid ANY amount lower than men, all else held constant, women would always be preferred over men. It stands to reason then that there is some way to account for this 3.6%, but as there is no model to address this earnings gap, it still concerns me.

290,aw7h04,2019-03-01,AskEconomics,Why does geographical pay disparity exist in MNCs?,"Why are different employees in the same firm, same role across geographies paid different wages?

This is most visible in FANG tech roles - pay disparity exists for the same role with the same expectations across geographies. Job roles, their requirements and expectations are standardised across the organisation.

I can understand that these different geographies are effectively separate labour markets and therefore labour supplies are decoupled.

If a company hires someone at city X even when employees(of the same skills) are available for cheaper at city Y this implies that labour demand is also decoupled.

Is there any data on the causes of such a large differential, to the tune of 6-7x for entry level tech roles?

The gap seems narrower at higher paid roles.

(My hypothesis for the above is - as living costs become a smaller fraction of income, CoL becomes a less weighted factor helping labour supply to become coupled. However CoL is not the only cause behind weakly coupled labour supplies - Dublin salaries are higher than London for some reason.)

Two different explanations I can think of for the pay disparity

1. Returns to local scale - there are productivity gains from people even across multiple teams/orgs sharing the same physical space(networking events, cross team/org communication, easier re-orgs) and therefore it's possible for there to be differing productivity gains to a firm for similar people joining different offices.

2. MNCs use their market power in low pay markets to suppress wage/enact wage discrimination(what's a good term for an analogue of price discrimination?) in these markets.

Empirical support for 1 would be higher disparities between locations with large and small offices. This does not seem to explain the pay disparities among offices of, say Amazon at Bangalore/Hyderabad vs several smaller centres in US and Europe.

Empirical support for 2 would be higher disparity in firms which employ a more sizeable chunk of the talent at low pay locations. However I am not aware of any companies that have a tiny footprint at 'low pay' geographies(and therefore no market power and hence motive to wage discriminate) and no disparity.

Also, salary levels for any job role across cities seem to follow the same order for FANG regardless of sizes of their offices at various cities which vary widely, which defies both 1 and 2.

295,15ub28a,2023-08-18,AskEconomics,Economics of local currencies in isolation. Can isolated country save money?,"I have an interesting question (at least I think so), but it's kind of difficult to even explain...

So, imagine that some country existed in isolation from the rest of the world. It's completely self sufficient, developed economy, all is great, etc. But since it's completely isolated - there is no currency exchange with other countries, so the value of the currency can only be measured in tangible assets rather than how it's normally done by looking at the exchange rate. It also prevents it from accumulating foreign reserves and assets which can be used to boost its economy using the ""outside world"" without affecting local economy.

From my understanding, if the said isolated country decides to save money for ""rainy day"" it would just create deflationary pressure beyond certain threshold, since it's taking currency from the economy, but if it decides to spend its currency it would do the opposite - drive the inflation (which might be offset by increased economic output, etc., but still).

So, the question is - what can such a country even do to ""save money for later"" without interacting with other countries? I don't see any way to do that other than making its ""savings"" in tangible productive assets (e.g. natural resources).",Lurlerrr,t2_qh1an,1.0,3,6

TL;DR He makes two contradictory assumptions about the detriment function d for each group. First (A1) he assumes that d is a constant, initially across all firms, and then later within a given firm even when its size changes. Second (A2) he assumes that total detriment is a function only of the *proportion* of W/B employees within each firm, which, it turns out, implies variable d. As a result his whole argument collapses and is invalid.

Arrow separates the wage paid into a $ cost (w or wage) and a utility cost (d or detriment), both indexed by the two groups under consideration  ""W"" and ""B"".

(1) Profit (pi) is pi = f(W+B) - w(subW)W - w(sub B)B

The distaste for employees of a given group is d(sub W or B), the negative of the marginal rate of substitution of profits for W or B labor. [edit clarify]

From this he derives, assuming d is constant within a given firm, 

(4) w(sub W) - W(Sub B) = d(sub B) - d(sub W) > 0, 

if we assume that the detriment for B is larger than for W.

Now, assuming all firms have the same utility function, he derives 

(7)  d(sub W)W + d(sub B)B = 0

So employers lose nothing from discrimination and the only effect is a transfer from B to W employees. [edit fix]

The sketched proof of (7) depends on an assessment of the effect on the firm of a change in the number of employees, with the ratio kept fixed, given assumption A2 that the utility effect of employee composition depends only on the ratios of W and B.

Now he relaxes the assumption that all firms have the same utility function, but still requiring that all firms have a utility function that (apart from profit) depends only on the ratio of W and B employees.

From this, with the additional assumption A3 that the firms all have a mix of W and B employees, he derives an expression for the ratio of W and B employees in each firm, [edit typo]

W/L = d(sub B)/(w(sub B) - w(sub W)) = - d(sub W)/(w(sub W) - w(sub B)) [edit fix]

I will explain in a comment in detail why this is wrong, according to me.

In popular media and on the global stage, we encounter stereotypes about Americans, which may, in part, result from their economic strength, ranging from misconceptions about their education to notions of excessive patriotism and a reliance on firearms to solve problems.  
  
The United States, throughout its history, has wielded tremendous economic power, marked by groundbreaking innovations and contributions to science and technology. Its global influence extends to diplomacy, trade, and cultural exchange, largely driven by its economic might.  
  
This intriguing paradox prompts the question: How can a nation, often stereotyped as lacking in certain educational and intellectual aspects, simultaneously hold a position as one of the most powerful, innovative, and influential countries globally, largely because of its economic achievements?  
  
I recognize that beyond historical opportunities (like the 18th century when Europe grappled with religious conflicts, colonialism, and nationalism), America attracted educated individuals seeking a better life, possessed vast economic resources, had weak neighbors, a unified culture, language, and society, and introduced the world's first capitalist democracy, reaping numerous economic benefits.  
  
The solution I've found is that even if the average American isn't perceived as exceptionally intelligent or a model citizen, their economic contributions are a fundamental part of their culture. The United States pioneered capitalism and wholeheartedly embraced it like no other nation in history, which has been a significant driver of its success.",Fijoza,t2_v1onpuq9,0.81,44,67

I'm trying to analyze this strictly from an economics point of view, not from a social or opinionated standpoint.

I see two scenarios:

A: Males earn X (total economic payout) money, factories produce Y amount of product, female average free time = Z. Product production satisfies consumer population, livable conditions.

B: Males earn X/2 money, females earn X/2 money, factory now produces Y+ amount of product from added female population, average female free time = Z- working hours. Product production grows, prices drop across the board as demand decreases, single males and females have reduced buying power due to salary reduction.

Now the question: Is there some accurate way to measure the amount of free time that women have given up in relation to the percentage price drop in consumer goods and reduction of male salaries? How does this affect single earners in our economy, and their ability to survive? Does it force more people to enter the workforce than in the past?

308,k4ql6l,2020-12-01,AskEconomics,Do economists have a confirmation bias?,"Hi everyone, a econ major here. I'd like to share a little reflection I have been developing the last weeks

As I take deeper courses of macro and micro I see a trend in the way that economics are taught around the world. We start from hiper-simplified models with assumptions that don't resemble reality to make these conceptual frameworks easier to learn right? Then as you take more advanced courses we incorporate more variables to the models with mathematical tools so they can be more exact. 

Why does this happens? Because econ is a social science and we can't have the degree of accuracy that natural sciences like physics, why? because our subject of study (humans) and the related variables can't be controlled or tested. (I guess you'll all agree with this)

Now, I think in the academia and the people in high positions of economic policymaking there's a confirmation bias in terms of confronting our models with reality. Every time that a major crisis occurs there's a heavy review in the mainstream economics theories that dominated the field. This seems to be a natural issue in the history of any science as when something is proven false we should move towards other foundations, but of course it's quite hard in our field as we can't ""prove"" statements as other sciences do.

I feel like there's a strong confirmation bias among influential economists as we try to make the reality more like the model and not the opposite (which is what you would expect in other science).

If you agree with the last statement then what are the causes? I will try to propose one:  


It's a very well known fact that many of the students that enter graduate programs of econ come from non-economics backgrounds, such as math, physics, statistics, engineering, etc. These people in their backgrounds studied hard science where they have an exact degree of accuracy in predictions and can test the variables that influence the phenomenons. Ofc that isn't the case in econ, but they keep the same mindset. Then you have them in high positions in academia, central banking, international organizations or government and they think they understand situations that we simply can't (and again, that's why there are reviews of mainstream economics every time we have a crisis and why there's this ridiculized conception that economist always fail when predicting anything).

Finally, if my explanation is correct, what are the political implications of this? I think that it might be that we should move towards higher degrees of economic freedom as the intervention decisions that economists do are made without the proper information and therefore distorsionate market equilibriums.

What do you think? I'm wrong? why?",aNu2001,t2_46pdlryn,0.91,85,32

I'm also curious if the platform serves as a good example of wealth redistribution among those on the platform.

There is a chapter (16, I believe) about capitalism where he describes it as a system where businesses reinvest profits today because of the belief in generating wealth in the future from that investment. It was the first time I had heard capitalism described as a system of reinvestment (as opposed to how I usually think of it, which is making a profit based on a free or fair market). 

The idea got me thinking about structural ways that governments could change tax code to balance out wealth disparities. Specifically, if equipment can be capitalized and depreciated, why couldn't employees' salaries and wages (up to a maximum threshold: for example, up to $75000 in 2023) be capitalized and then also depreciated. In my thinking, wages and salary are investment in it's employees' productivity, so why not give businesses a financial benefit of depreciating the cost as a capital expense (I.e. reducing it's tax basis). This also would seemingly incentivize business to pay it's employees up to the maximum threshold and potentially lower the risks of hiring more workers when there is a need.

This post is me spitballing but I'd be curious to hear others thoughts on the merits, oversights or weaknesses this idea. If you know if any economics papers covering this idea, I'd definitely like to check them out if you share. I didn't find anything of note when I googled topics like ""depreciating salary costs"".

Edit to add: I know that typically depreciation is a decrease in an asset's value from the balance sheet and that decrease reflected on the income statement. In this scenario, I guess that balance of offsetting accounts wouldn't work (at least with existing rules).",Noshoesded,t2_3miavl2n,0.75,4,11

Szenario 1 - The hero mother

Imagine a wife and a husband work together in the same job at the same level, earning equal pay. The wife then gives birth and takes four years off work to raise her child.

When she returns to work her husband has progressed in the meantime. He has been promoted to a senior position and earns 20% more than she does. They no longer have equal pay - the woman has been peanlized for motherhood, the father has been financialy rewarded for more relevant work experience.

Szenario 2 - Shared responsibilities

Imagine now that the mother resumes work after two years and that the father takes care full time of the child for another two years. On their child's fourth birthday the father resumes work. Both have been peanlized for child rearing as both have lost two years of relevant work experience. However, both end up with the same salary.

On the one hand it feels like rent-seeking behavior that isn’t socially optimal, especially given that some people have bots to immediately buy up stock as soon as it’s available, such that the average person has a slim chance of being able to buy the good at its “normal” price. So what could possibly be the value added to society of this type of behavior?

The other hand is that scalpers act as a distributing agent almost like a form of price discrimination. Those with the highest willingness to pay on average may be those who get the most utility out of the good, thus scalping gets the product to those who will benefit most from it, though consumer surplus would be minimized if price discrimination is perfect.

Capitalists like to say workers aren't exploited because labor doesn't determine value. 

But there's this YouTube video I watched:
https://youtu.be/IzE_Xurt588

Where he explained why even without objective labor theory of value and even with marginal utility workers are still exploited. 

He argues that labor is the essential catalytic factor in turning a raw ingredients into an assembled product and is responsible for the subtraction or addition of any subjective determined value that results from production.

So even if we say a car that increases value overtime without any additional labor the value's increase still depends on the laborers creation of the car in the first place. A car can't increase in value if the workers didn't create the car in the first place. 

Pigouvian exploitation:
Price discrimination - selling something at different prices to different demographics

Monopsony- a monopoly in purchase and consumption

So because the worker is forced into participating in the expropriation of labor the company the worker is working for can determine the price of his labor low to the capitalists benefit. But the capitalists can change that value of labor in the production process when selling them to consumers with a higher valuation. They often using fetish cultivation tactics like spectacle and destajce or playing into marginal utility and supply and demand.

So the capitalists can play market forces to their benefit to maximize their earnings at the exploitative expense of worker and consumer. If we cut out the middleman (Capitalists) and the expriopriation of labor and have the workers control the means of production and therefore the fruits of their labor they would be better off.

In today's society capitalists can us etheirbwelath, power, and Monopsony to accumulate wealth without doing anything productive. And what they can do the workers can just do it themselves if they had controled the capital in the first place which is excluded from them by the institution of private property. 

He even says that ""austrian schools and capitalist apologists including Keynesians love to use the weaponization of price discrimination as a supposed justification for capitalist exploitation""

This ability to perform price descrimiation, fetishization, and exploitation allows capitalists to exacerbate feedback loops of accumulation and stratification which produces more inequality.

For example, the sunk cost fallacy might make sense in a scenario with incomplete information where reputation matters, as, if you don't abandon it, you could still try to sell the project as a success, because others don't have the information to determine it was actually a poor investment, whereas abandoning the project just gives you a loss on your record and it is difficult for others to see it was actually a prudent decision. Or you could explain loss aversion by assuming people choose to hold money (instead of buying things or investing) only to cover some relatively predictable future expenses and no more than required for that purpose. That way, it would make sense to gamble to avoid even quite small losses, as they come with the large added cost, independent of how large they are, of having to sell something/pull out of your investment to come up with the needed money.

My basic argument is that with more money at your disposal consumers will be encouraged to spend more, driving prices up even more. Considering that inflation is strongly tied to monetary supply and global supply chains (e.g. oil and gas prices), it looks to me that giving employees more money (unclear where they would come from), can only motivate companies to increase prices to make up for the extra spend, therefore leading to a decrease of purchasing power, which is the opposite of the intended effect.

I’ve read a lot of acemoglu and he doesn’t seem like the Jordan Petersen type to suggest that in order to address this women should leave the workforce because they’re dragging down men’s wages- so is he really suggesting a direct correlation like that or is it more complex

367,18ng4fi,2023-12-21,AskEconomics,Is the Job Market Really this Bad?,"Hey guys, looking for some serious advice on what to do. I currently feel very lost in life and there's really nobody I can speak to besides those on the internet.   
Some background, I graduated as an Economics Major from a Top 10 University in California (Top 30 National), and have been unable to find a job for the past 3 months. I graduated with a 3.4 GPA, and worked all 4 years of college. I didn't do any internships because I was working full time and going to school, but is that what is really killing me right now? The lack of internship was only brought up in one of my interviews, to which I explained how I worked mostly to fund my whole education, to which they were very understanding. 

  
I have had my resume revised and am currently using the best iteration of it. I have applied to over 200 jobs, and out of that 200ish, I have had about 15 interviews. Only 2 of those 15 did I not make it past the first round, and the rest I made it into the second/final rounds, but was never selected. The closest I came to receiving an offer, they told me I was pretty much going to get the job, I reach out a few days later after hearing nothing, and then they tell me the Department Lead was told by the company to no longer fill any more open positions (and this company is a VERY big name, everyone knows it- respectfully not going to name drop ofc). That was the most soul crushing experience I've had recently, and it really killed a lot of my motivation to move forward. The jobs I've been applying for have been so entry level, I sometimes tell myself I might as well just go work at McDonald's at this point. Even for the majority of the in-person interviews I've gone to where there was a waiting room, I've 10 times out of 10 have been the youngest person in the room, and I still always give it my best during the interview, but still always have the gut feeling that I'm not going to get the position just going by seniority. 

  
So after 3 months of dealing with all this and feeling like I've gone close to nowhere with my life since graduating, what are my options or what is something I can do in the meantime? In terms of skills, I've been mastering Excel and self teaching myself how to use SAP as most of these jobs I'm applying to require some knowledge or experience of that. I go to the gym 5 days a week, and that is currently the only enjoyment I feel I have in my life right now. I don't currently have a job because I am putting my full effort into doing these Zoom interviews throughout the week and driving to various cities for in-person interviews as well. I tried my absolute best these past 3 months to stay optimistic and keep trying and to never give up, but all these rejections have really started taking a toll on me mentally, to where I realized that I'm now applying to less and less jobs everyday as I've become subconsciously unmotivated. It just sucks because I really enjoy working, considering I did it throughout my years in college and enjoyed it. I'm obviously very eager to work, it just upsets me that there's no opportunities despite me trying my absolute best. 

  
I'm just really lost and don't know how to move forward, I feel as if I'm stuck. I don't really have anybody I can speak to about this in real life. The only suggestion I've been given is to go to get my Masters degree or an MBA, but I don't know if I'm quite ready for that yet. Upon graduating, I was really excited to find a career where I can grow and that aligned with everything I went to school for, but I just don't know anymore. Any guidance or advice would be appreciated on what to do next, thank you. ",Past_Morning1882,t2_elojzu65,0.81,51,29

They give a few examples from social psychology and sociology where it seems to have negative effects on the quality of scholarship.

[This paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691620924463) looks at replication attempts of just under 200 studies in psychology, and finds that, regardless of which side's worldview they seem to support, they replicate with equal frequency. This suggests that political leanings may not affect the outcome of science.

But I wonder if this is just because of the relatively low D:R ratio in psychology. Is it possible that in some fields, like gender studies or [Christian apologetics](https://www.liberty.edu/residential/divinity/masters/christian-apologetics/), where the ratio of people with one ideology to another is high, it could start to seep in again?

Are there more subtle ways where political opinions could make their way into the research?

I have been accepted and offered some scholarship money. I may have to take out some loans still, but relatives are also willing to help me out. All in all, it should not be too expensive. 

Should I go or work first? I really want to continue to study economics. That's why I want to go.

-----------------------------------
Workers must work 2.5 times harder, for only 1.3 times as much money, while prices are 3.5 times higher than they were in 1975.

So, let's do the math...

The average worker is working 2.584 times harder for (128.5/356.49) = 36.05% of the effective income their counterpart would've made in 1979.

If we divide the change in effective income a worker gets by the change in the amount of work they have to do for it, the average job is (0.3605 / 2.584) = 13.95% as valuable as its counterpart in 1979.

I don't understand economics much. But I have a concerning question. As somewhat obvious (I guess), most western European socialist countries (obviously not including Nordic countries like Norway, etc) are doing well; e.g. Germany and The Netherlands. My question is what does the economic future of these countries look like?  

The political climate of the world is at a tension now. A person - who I think somewhat understood economics - said something about socialist countries. He said that the way that these economies are dealing with outsiders, specifically taking care of anyone who can enter the country, these economies will collapse; or at least worsen tremendously. He said for example that The Netherlands is giving unemployment services to anyone without any kind of discrimination, which is absurd because there are jobs that pay less than that. Unfortunately he didn't go into much detail.  

This made me curious and somewhat scared. I live in a developing country and I'm considering immigration with something like a skilled worker visa. Pinpointing my values, I arrived at the conclusion that culturally my high preference for the country of destination is The Netherlands.

I reviewed the last jobs report of August, and I was wondering how it is possible that there is an increase in Nonfarm Payroll and an increase in the Unemployment rate.

In my understanding,
Nonnfarm payroll increase means that more people (excluding farms jobs) have gotten jobs and started to work.
Unemployment rate increase means that more people that are unemployed are now seeking for a job.

The confusing part is, if more people are working now (Nonfarm payroll has increased), how is it possible that unemployment rate increased too?
I can only think about a situation in which more unemployed people that HAVE NOT been seeking for a job, are now in the hunt for a new job.

In the US, there is a massive stigma and even retaliation for revealing salary information (an old company I was with was becoming a JV partner with another company and they said we weren’t allowed to share personal compensation information at the risk of being fired). 

My professor said that if we made worker compensation information public, it would also reduce information asymmetry and allow for pay to become subject to a more free market dynamic, which would transfer power and wealth to the workers and increase compensation. 

He personally thought all compensation should be made public and that would help overall worker compensation to increase relative to today.

Why doesn’t this attract more competition that results in wages and profit margins being forced down?,"Wall Street has essentially no artificial restriction on the amount of people who can achieve the credentials required to enter the industry, unlike, say, medicine, which is restricted by the amount of medical school graduates, which is turn restricted by the number of medical schools. Also, it is not a winner take all industry, the way, say, social media or entertainment is. To that end, why are investment banks and hedge funds able to maintain such high margins and salaries that aren’t present in other fields? 

Oddly, in spite of there being orders of magnitudes more hedge funds now than in 1980, there is very little in the way of price competition. The 2 and 20 compensation model has remained the standard in spite of middling performance from most funds. How is the sector able to get away with this when other sectors are not? For example, structural engineers aren’t able able to charge 2% of a buildings construction cost annually in perpetuity as long as it doesn’t fall down because there are other firms that will work for $150/man hour with no residuals. Why hasn’t this happened in finance?

However, on the other hand, unlike hedge funds, there seem to be essentially no startup investment banks. If you look at the top investment banks, basically none were founded recently (mergers excluded).

This is more a general question on your opinions. What effects do you believe automation would have on the labor force? Whether driverless cars making most taxis drivers redundant or digital assistance at hotel receptions for checking in and everything else.

Intuition would say it would reduce the demand of labor, thus increasing involuntary unemployment. This of course lacks a lot of depth, so I would be happy to hear what your views or opinions are on this topic in the coming decades.

For example, many advances economies have the aging demographics problem (such as Germany and Japan, but USA also). This causes issues with the economic growth of the countries. Would automation assist in softening this problem, as there would be less labor demand (for jobs that could be automated), meaning there is less labor demand as a whole in the economy, and the employees whose jobs have been replaced will fill missing employment in other jobs and sectors.

With higher efficiencies, do you see prices decline and inflation picking up? How do you think economic policy (monetary and fiscal) would react to future scenarios?

Could automation be the next step in technological advancement that increases an economy's steady-state?

418,my58pr,2021-04-25,AskEconomics,How do salaries compare between countries,"I'm struggling to understand how to understand the salary differences between countries. Primarily my country (The Netherlands) and the United States. What I mean by understanding the differences is how quality of life, buying power and exchange rates play into the differences.   


I'll explain.  
I im an engineer currently out of university and my salary is about 40k a year all bonuses included. Its about 2300 a month after taxes which means I pay about 25% in income taxes. However, due to the changing taxes as you make more I pay about 50% income tax over all the extra salary that I make when I get a raise. I read that in some places in the US a starting salary of an engineer can be around 70k to 100k. Now obviously the currencies are different but the exchange rates aren't that much different, that 100k would be about 83k here. 

Now I do know that you pay more in health care but still, I don't see how that salary is incredibly high. Especially given the fact that products like electronics are almost the exact same amount. But over your monthly salary that same laptop is very cheap. 

I know very little about economics but I can imagine that your salary is not a measure of how much 'money' you have to spend but rather the amount of money you have each month minus your monthly expenses. If I do that I have, of that 2300 dollars about 1000 dollars left to save for things I want to buy and also pay of extra luxury. However, if people in the US make 80k a year, I can imagine that the amount of money you have left to spend each month is so much more than here in the Netherlands, yet I hear people say that a 80k salary 'isn't that high'. 80k in the Netherlands is an insanely high salary and something you can 'maybe' expect if you are a true expert in your field and over 40 or 50 years old. Its what a surgeon might make if they are at the top of their fields. If I do the math, 80.000 a year is about 4200 a month after taxes. that's roughly twice what I make. As I meantioned though, products in your country are about the same price, so relative to your salary, id say everything is super cheap there. Also, gasoline seems much cheaper, its 0,70 EUR yet I pay 1.60 EUR, more than twice as much.

Is it that health care and rent it so expensive that in the US a person pays so much more that their 'Free income' is about the same? Because if I assume that every dollar that you earn is about half as much, I would say that that would give a huge friction if you compare that to the exchange rate.

I find it hard to verbalise what im struggling to understand. So let me put it in another context. Lets say someone with the exact same job as me is making $80k a year. So I go to my manager and I tell him I want to make 80k as well (or whatever would be the equivalent in my currency) because I can get that salary in another country where products are equally as expensive. What would he argue where he have a perfect understanding of economics? Is it that he would say that even though you make more in the US, the cost of living are so much higher that your free income (after rent, electricity, healthcare) is the same? If that where true, if both of us would get a 4% raise, that raise would be worth much more because over your 80k salary because that 4% yields much more 'extra' money with a US salary even though nothing changes in your monthly expenses.

I know economics master degree holders have crazy income potential however supply chain jobs are expected to grow at a 30% rate and the masters program offered at my school had mentioned they have a 100% job placement rate before they even graduate (not within a year like most schools advertise) and not a single student had a job offer below a 70k salary and some had as high as 84-87k starting salaries. However the field has limited growth from what I’ve been made aware and you may work a long time until you hit triple digits and typically cap around 120-130k. with it being such an in demand industry your likely gonna take on some stress and gonna work extended over time hours, at least in your first few years.

Why do further people advocate for multi millionaires to pay a fair share when they the ones who grow and expand the job market for the most part?," I was not born in America. I did not take a formal economics class in my secondary education as I am a now a D.V.M.

 Why cant everyone pay a 20% flat tax on all sources of income from earned wages to stock dividends and inherited assets? 

If those billionaires and multi-millionaires  taxed on everything from earned income to their stock trading gains which could equal hundreds of billions of dollars why isn't this fair to the people who could only afford to pay the 20% of their earned income from their vocations?

there are 3 categories; million/billionaires, skilled workers, and working poor to generalize this scenario. 

For easy math purposes lets say there are 150 million people who work in America of a country of 300 million.

 There are about 30  million multimillionaires.( I actually googled this to get this number). I further googled those in the 1% in income but are not multi-millionaires. That is another 20 million Americans. So for simple math purposes one third  of the working population (50 million people) is a well off or a multimillionaire based on the google searches of stated income demographics.  

&#x200B;

So if the top 3rd of workers is taxed at 20%. just say they make an even 1 million a year to account for the 1% and billionaires together. 1 mil taxed at 20% is 200k a year in taxable income per taxable. 200 thousand x 50 million is 10 trillion dollars! 

&#x200B;

Let's just say another 3rd of the working population is the working poor making 25K a year. After tax they would get about 20k to live off of which is still doable. ( I lived on 18K a year with a wife when we were both in professional school) Put all that to get her and you get 250 billion dollars. 

&#x200B;

Then there are the people in between lets just say two working skilled workers make 150K a year. Their 20% would be 30k. 30K x 50 million equals about 1.5 trillion dollars a year in tax revenue. 

&#x200B;

The argument that the middle class would subsidize the lower class does not add up. AS the upper third is paying 10 trillion in tax. 

&#x200B;

When we add all the income groups together, we get about 12 trillion dollars! 

&#x200B;

the US government is at 6 trillion now. Wouldn't we have a surplus of funding then to expand social programs and provide universal healthcare?

On the other hand, retiring baby boomers as well as declining immigration in last 5 years have caused a labour shortage which has lead to higher salaries. But if this is true, then it doesn't look like a good sign to me in the long term. With an aging population and declining birth rate, unless immigration goes back to pre 2016 levels, the consumer spending will drop in the long run. So, I feel like the current job market is due to factors that are not really good in the long term.

Arguments/my reasoning:

* If businesses are failing because no one is using them (e.g. air travel), then they are going to continue to need bailouts. Thinking bailouts are a one-time thing vs. ongoing UBI-type payments is unrealistic.

* We've already seen companies using the cash to buy back stock.  OK, we can put in legislation to stop that, but paying people would be far more efficient.

* Giving working people money maintains money flow - working people buy necessities, rather than investments.

* Medium/long-term, we would realise either a) we don't need this/that industry or b) this industry needs to be more efficient.  It would provide a huge opportunity for innovation and entrepreneurship as people try to fill the vacuum left by collapsed companies.

We will only focus on Consumer Choice (preferences, utility and the utility maximization problem), Expected Utility Theory,  General Equilibrium and Game Theory.

It is mainly aimed towards those who want to do an MSc in Economics. I am unclear if it will have any usefulness in public/private sector roles that involve economic analysis.   
2. Applied Economic Policy Evaluation

Looks at the use of RCTs, experimental economics, simple game theory models and a few other tools that are used in policy evaluation. It takes a case study approach. We look at policy examples in pollution control, taxation, reducing pupil/teacher absenteeism, international climate agreements and the democratic process.   
3. Experimental Economics

Reference Text is Markets, Games and Strategic Interaction

It aims to introduce the methods of experimental economics and its uses in different areas of economics. It looks at experimental markets and price discovery, individual decision making (Baye's rule, information cascade, statistical discrimination), signalling games and prediction markets. 

For context: I am in my final year of an Economics degree. I plan to go straight into work or to take a masters in data science/statistics.

[Ps:This is an agrumentary I built up over the years of beeing on reddit, I hope it still counts:](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThingsMatthieuFound/comments/4ieefs/compilation_of_studies_and_arguments_about_the/)

**Tl;dr:** Their are two kind of wage gaps: the adjusted and the unadjusted wage gap:

* The unadjusted one is a problem because even if we can explain aspects of it, it still shows the position of subservience women have in relation to men as well as the double standards that still exists between the two genders.
* The adjusted one is a problem because even accounting for all factor it's still between 4% and 8%. This gap exists because people (men and women) rate a women who is objectively as good as a man as less competent. We don't see this implicit bias we all have, but it's important to acknowledge that it is here.

**Studies:**

**Adjusted and unadjusted wage gap:**

http://blog.dol.gov/2012/06/07/myth-busting-the-pay-gap/

>Decades of research shows a gender gap in pay even after factors like the kind of work performed and qualifications (education and experience) are taken into account. These studies consistently conclude that discrimination is the best explanation of the remaining difference in pay. Economists generally attribute about 40% of the pay gap to discrimination – making about 60% explained by differences between workers or their jobs. 

**Adjusted wage gap:**

http://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9118a9ef-0771-4777-9c1f-8232fe70a45c/compendium---sans-appendix.pdf

> Discrimination is difficult to measure directly. It is illegal, and furthermore, most people don’t recognize discriminatory behavior in themselves or others. This research asked a basic but important question: If a woman made the same choices as a man, would she earn the same pay? The answer is no. 

and

>Ten years out, the unexplained portion of the pay gap widens. AAUW’s analysis showed that while choices mattered, they explained even less of the pay gap ten years after graduation. Controlling for a similar set of factors, we found that ten years after graduation, a 12 percent difference in the earnings of male and female college graduates is unexplained and attributable only to gender. 

**Viewing women as less qualified than men:**

http://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474.abstract

>In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant.

**STEM and advantage/disadvantage of children:**

http://www.nature.com/news/why-women-earn-less-just-two-factors-explain-post-phd-pay-gap-1.19950?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews

>Women earn nearly one-third less than men within a year of completing a PhD in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) field, suggests an analysis of roughly 1,200 US graduates.
Much of the pay gap, the study found, came down to a tendency for women to graduate in less-lucrative academic fields — such as biology and chemistry, which are known to lead to lower post-PhD earnings than comparatively industry-friendly fields, such as engineering and mathematics.
But after controlling for differences in academic field, the researchers found that women still lagged men by 11% in first-year earnings. That difference, they say, was explained entirely by the finding that married women with children earned less than men. Married men with children, on the other hand, saw no disadvantage in earnings.

**Double standards between men and women:**

>Women are less likely than men to ask for a raise , and they don’t negotiate as aggressively. But that doesn’t mean they are less-capable negotiators. Rather, women don’t ask because they fear real repercussions. When women advocate for themselves, they’re often perceived as pushy or unappreciative. Studies have shown that people are less likely to want to work with women who initiate salary discussions, whereas men don’t see the same backlash. “Women are still expected to fulfill prescriptions of feminine niceness,”

and

>Men tend to earn more the more children they have, whereas women see their pay go down with each additional child.

**Conclusion:**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it0EYBBl5LI

>1:14:Right, but so, this 16 to 21% number just looks at all full-time workers. It doesn't account for differences in education, or skills, or experience, or occupation. When you factor all that stuff in, the pay gap shrinks to somewhere between 4 and 8% depending on who's doing the math. This is the so-called ""unexplained pay gap"" that is, there is no economic explanation for it and most nonpartisan analyses agree that this part of the pay gap is directly due to gender discrimination.

and

>4:31:And interestingly, even in careers dominated by women men disproportionately advance to supervisory roles. Like, most librarians are women, but male librarians are disproportionately likely to become library directors. And there are still large pay gaps within careers that employ mostly women, from nursing to librarianship. In fact, unless you really cherry pick the data, a real and consistent gender pay gap exists across almost all fields at all education levels at all ages. [...] In short [...] there IS a gender pay gap but it is not as simple as women making 77 or 79 cents for every dollar men make. Instead, it's an extremely complicated web of interwoven factors.

**Common counter argument:** 

**If women are payed less, why aren't employer only hiring women?**

->Humans are not perfect rational being, the bias is non-conscious to begin with, because people (men and women) think men are more competent and will bring in more money than equally competent women, so they pay them more. *We don't see this implicit bias we all have, but it's important to acknowledge that it is here.*

**It's normal that there is a wage gap, and there will always be one, because men and women are fundamentally different and make different choices.**

->Then why is it different from country to country? *Which wage gap is the ""natural"" one?* This shows that the wage gap is mainly due to culture, or else we would expect the wage gap to be the same everywhere, and not due to the intrinsic difference between men and women. If the gap is due to culture (which it is, like demonstrated above), we should strive to change this culture to achieve greater equality for everybody.

[and quoting](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadSocialScience/comments/3gxho1/the_wage_gap_doesnt_exist_because_we_can_know_the/cu2f7g7/) /u/Naggins:

->""Why do women choose lower paying professions? Why don't women rate money as a primary concern in job choice? Why don't women request pay raises as much as men? Perhaps these questions are too difficult. Or perhaps it's because if one thinks hard about the answers to these questions, one is faced with the fact that women are assigned a gender role of subservience to men in the workforce, one that still frames men as primary breadwinners, and one that discourages the assertiveness and confidence required to request a pay raise. Even then, many people explain these things away by spouting unsubstantiated biotruths, *suggesting that women have an innate inclination towards subservience and meekness* just because that's how things have apparently been in Western society for the last ~10-1500 years. *These claims have no basis in scientific fact* and even if they did, do not account for the regulation of innate inclinations by societal constructs and prejudices.""

**The adjusted wage gap is only five percent, this is negligible.**

->Five percent is not negligible, would you agree to take a five percent cut in your paycheck just because you are a man, or just because you're white? *On an median american income of 50'000$ per year, this is 2500$ lost.*

455,79zxz8,2017-11-01,badeconomics,"Q: Why hasn't arbitrage eliminated the gender wage gap? A: Conditional on observables, it has!","A user comes forward with a question: [why hasn't arbitrage eliminated the gender wage gap?](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/79s8uk/the_fiat_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/dp4on91/)

This is a good question -- a pretty deep one, actually. If wage discrimination isn't arbitraged away in the labor market, that would seem to suggest there are some major and persistent imperfections in the labor market. Possibly that there are major misallocation problems in the economy more broadly. Moreover, if arbitrage won't wipe out discrimination, what will? Presumably, the answer is policy.

So getting this question right matters.

That's why I was so disappointed when I saw u/edprescott come in to that thread and give this answer to that question:

>hissss hiss hisssssss hisss [hisSSssSS](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/qr/qr1042.pdf) hissssssssss

-u/edprescott

Err, sorry, let me translate from parseltongue:

> Arbitrage already has wiped out all the discrimination that occurs within occupation-experience-skill cells. That is why there is no gender wage gap when you control for things -- because there is no taste discrimination component to the gender wage gap.

-u/edprescott

Yeesh, no, I still don't think I quite have it, sorry guys, my parseltongue is rusty, I only have one macro paper and it's an empirical one so... let me give this another go. [Ah, yeah, here it is:](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/79s8uk/the_fiat_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/dp4qmw6/)

> 1. Women make less than men, on average.

> 2. Women make about the same as men, on average, given education, experience, and industry. So if you're looking to fill a specific open position in your firm, you're looking within an education-industry-experience cluster and won't see (much of) a wage gap. (It's still there, but smaller.) **This part is important because it means you can't arbitrage it away at a fine-grained micro level.**

> 3. (1) and (2) are consistent with each other because women tend to be over-represented in industries that are also lower-paying and tend to have experience gaps (because, um, they have kids).


-u/Integralds, but emphasis is mine


So, why is this overall a bad answer to the question: ""why doesn't wage discrimination get arbitraged away?"" 

**A. It underplays the magnitude of wage gap that clearly could be arbitraged away and, due to this empirical error, mistakenly overestimates the efficacy of arbitrage in imperfect and highly fricitonal labor markets.**

[Blau and Kahn's](http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel.20160995) recent JEL on the GWG find that the raw raw gender wage gap is around 23 percentage points in the PSID. Using the PSID's rich wealth of variables on industry, occupation, education, experience, etc. to control for the kitchen sink, the residual gender wage gaps falls to 8 percentage points at the mean. 

So, roughly one third of the wage is unexplained and apparently going unarbitraged away. This strikes me as sufficiently substantial in size so as to discredit any ""actually, arbitrage mostly already wiped out the GWG"" type explanation.

Now, integralds may be inclined to argue that this isn't a failure of arbitrage and that women within the same industry-occupation-experience cells as men just are of lower productivity in unobserved ways. But I would suggest that, if anything, the opposite seems more likely to be true, [as bias in hiring and promotion processes can result in women of being stuck in the same positions as less talented men.
](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.90.4.715) I would also add that these GWG estimates probably are underestimates of the GWG you would get if you were to adjust wages for the compensating differentials one would expect women to receive for enduring common female gender specific workplace disamenities (that is to say, sexual harassment and the like).

And while we're at it, why limited ourselves to the GWG? [There's a real big racial wage gap](http://econ2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ321/orazem/Charles_GuryanPrejudiceWages.pdf) (and racial employment gap) that persists even [when you go hog wild controlling for all kinds of crazy stuff like AFQT.](http://www.uh.edu/~jlehman2/papers/Lang_Lehmann_JEL.pdf) Why hasn't arbitrage wiped *that* out?

And, actually, come to think of it. What about historical data? Why didn't arbitrage wipe out the racial and gender wage gaps back in 1950? Was it the case even back then that there just wasn't much of a gap to arbitrage? Or was the problem that markets were less competitive back then and that the narrowing of the gaps we've seen since then is [mainly due to market competitiveness increasing](http://www.nber.org/papers/w23687) and arbitrage ([pictured here](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/08/25/ap207187706677_wide-cd2b17e8babbeb109458f0b31d141849be9600fa.jpg?s=1400)) finally kicking in to solve the problem.

**B. It falsely concludes that arbitrage cannot wipe out the portions of the gender wage gap that are caused by differences across industry-occupation-education cells.** (""This part is important because it means you can't arbitrage it away at a fine-grained micro level."")

This is, of course, not true. I won't waste your time too much with the classic MHE analysis here, but in as much as the variation in those industry/occupation/education X variables is driven by end stage wage or hiring discrimination, then that component of the wage gap actually could be reduced by arbitrage at the end stage. Moreover, as seen in the orchestra paper linked above, even if one observes no apparent gender wage gap within industry-occupation-education cells, that does not necessarily imply there is not an ability conditional wage gap that potentially could be arbitraged away and, in turn, push down the magnitude of the GWG attributed to the X variables. So, actually, the amount of wage discrimination that arbitrage could be expected to get rid of (and is not currently getting rid of) is actually probably greater than what is seen in A.

I would also like to pay particular attention to the issue of workplace flexibility here. [Goldin highlights the importance of workplace flexibility](https://scholar.harvard.edu/goldin/publications/grand-gender-convergence-its-last-chapter) as a key determinant of the gender wage gap and the variation in it across occupations and across firms within occupations. A key point that she makes is that the costliness of providing workplace flexibility is endogenous to technology and to managerial decisions relating to how the production process is structured. Firms and indeed entire occupations have, in the past, reduced the productivity cost of providing workplace flexibility to their employees and have in turn reduced the gender wage gap with it. It is not at all clear, then, that the portion of the gender wage gap you attribute to occupational/industry differences and to childbearing cannot, in fact, be arbitraged away by clever firms finding relatively low cost ways of providing workpace flexibility. Now, it's not clear to what extent this is possible, but it seems unlikely that the answer is ""not at all"".



**C. Given the empirical issues with the ""actually, arbitrage mostly works"" hypothesis, it misses the better answer: that labor markets are sufficiently imperfect and frictional that one *should not expect* wage discrimination to be arbitraged away.**

Now, in fairness, integralds already [made a reply to this point:
](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/79s8uk/the_fiat_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/dp4rzoj/)
>I know all about frictions. Frictions alone don't do any work for you.
You need to argue that the frictions differentially affect men and women.

Yeah no, imperfect competition and frictions alone are definitely good enough to prevent arbitrage from wiping out employer taste discrimination. The Becker model strictly relies on perfect competition, meaning that if there is imperfect competition or monopsony power in the labor market (there is) the arbitrage-nukes-wage-discrimination results go away. Plus, even way back when, Arrow pointed out that misc old timey frictions like adjustment costs can wipe out the arbitrage results. To be a bit more modern though, [search frictions](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2535106?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) will do the trick. Moving to a [posted wage offers model](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828054825547) will do it too, meaning that [directed search doesn't enable competition to bail us out either](http://www.nber.org/papers/w17450.pdf). 

Heck, and even given all that, you don't *really* even need frictions to prevent arbitrage from wiping out wage gaps. Consumer taste discrimination and employee taste discrimination can persist indefinitely in the face of perfectly competitive market forces. As can employer taste discrimination, [provided you relabel discrimination from being about distaste for group X to taste for group Y.](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/97/2/307/1930399?redirectedFrom=fulltext) (Which is to say, competition won't wipe out the GWG provided your Harvey Weinsteins of the world don't mind losing a contract or two if it means they get to discriminate most of the time.)

Now, granted, this doesn't mean that competition can't be expected to depress wage discrimination to some degree. There is [some](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001979390405700404) [evidence](http://www.nber.org/papers/w6321) that it does. But the thrust of the literature [(see the excellent review here)](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22022) is that labor markets are sufficiently imperfect and frictioned up that competition just can't arbitrage away the gender wage gap, the racial wage gap, or any other wage gap you can think of.

Which, actually, isn't all that surprising when you think about it. I mean, the market doesn't even arbitrage away [productivity dispersion across firms in the same industry](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20161024). But that's another story.

Oh, and to get one last lick in, remember this?

> You need to argue that the frictions differentially affect men and women.

[Here ya go.](http://www.nber.org/papers/w7258) I know, I know, the Black 95 search model already shows how search frictions generate monopsony power for employers specifically against the workers subjected to taste discrimination. But this one is fun just because of how idiosyncratic at is. If women are disproportionately likely to be secondary earners that accept their husbands' location decisions, that reduces their ability to quit and look for new jobs and generates a source of gender specific monopsony power in the labor market. Hence the nurse thing.

**In summary:**

**1. There is monopsony power in the labor market.**

**2. There are search and matching frictions in the labor market.**

**3. (1) and (2), among other factors relating to the precise nature of the discrimination in play, prevent arbitrage from wiping out wage discrimination in the labor market.**

**4. At the end of the day, when it comes to policy time, I'd reckon the DoJ is a better bet than competition for wiping out employer taste discrimination.**",gorbachev,t2_3g3fi,0.88,233,211
456,s7iekd,2022-01-19,badeconomics,*Repost* Why women joining the workforce doesn't reduce wages (Response to Whatifalthist)," I'm reposting this to get more traction and that welfare-enhancing karma. For some reason there were visibility issues with the previous post I had made.

Firstly, here is shameless advertising for the video I made of this R1 for my YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDoUdMjQRBE).

The quote is from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIJq79HsvuU&list=WL&index=4&t=274s). It's worth listening to the section for the sheer audacity and confidence on display on a point the author gets very, very wrong.

From about 4 minutes, we get the following quote:

>…This all made 1945 to 1970 in the West and Japan the greatest era to the common person in history. However, a series of processes started to increase competition for wages. Firstly, immigration and women entering the workforce increased wage competition. I’m not saying these were inherently bad moves, women and immigrants improved their societies in countless ways but basic economics dictates when you increase the supply of something and demand can’t keep up then the cost goes down and when you get down to it, people are a commodity like any other.

**Part 1**

I put this example in as I quite like his political commentary, while his economic commentary is…lacking. But also he exemplifies the typical view people have when discussing the effects of women and wages. And he is a very popular YouTuber.

It seems to make sense, right? It seems so logical. There’s a lump of labour out there, and all of a sudden there’s a large increase of people, in this case women, vying for those jobs. And so it’s easy to see how that competition among so many people now wanting jobs would lead to employers not feeling the need to pay as much per employee, and thus lowering aggregate wages. Well firstly, it’s literally not bourne by the data.

For good measure, here are 2 graphs showing wage growth in Australia since 1997. These I made from ABS data.

[https://imgur.com/3tqEtfG](https://imgur.com/3tqEtfG)

[https://imgur.com/KRUtrnN](https://imgur.com/KRUtrnN)

These graph might not look great, with real wages not tracking per capita GDP growth, but we can see that in the US and Australia wages didn’t go down by a significant amount since the 1960s. Okay but there are declines and we would actually expect wages to have grown faster than what we see here. So maybe that’s the decline people are referring to. Is this due to women all of a sudden joining the labour force en masse?

This plays into and affirms the idea of the male breadwinner. The idea is that we had a simpler equilibria in the 50s, 60s and 70s, whereby men went to work and women largely stayed at home. This also plays into the idea that nowadays both parents need to work just to get by whereas previously it was possible just one person to work and for the family to do fine. This of course ignores two inconvenient facts. The first is that two people now both want to work because they can now afford more things than they could previously. People are no longer happy with what just 1 income can get them. Keeping up with the Jones’ and all that. Also this ignores the fact that when women were working at home was still doing work however it was unpaid labour. And since everything is measured in monetary terms GDP growth that meant that all of the work and all of the frankly really hard work that women were doing at home was not measured in statistics. And so ultimately all that happened when women started to join the workforce on mass is that they were now getting paid to work whereas previously they were not.

That’s what the proponents are usually saying with these kind of arguments, and it’s certainly what the YouTuber would have in mind too. Let’s go into more detail into breaking down the argument. Our first example in Part 2 will actually look at a source that on the surface refutes the claims and evidence above. We’ll finish examining this source at the end of this R1.

**Part 2**

We start off with our first source, Women, War, and Wages: The Effect of Female Labor Supply on the Wage Structure at Midcentury, by Daron Acemoglu, David Autor and David Lyle.

The paper looks at the participation of women in the labour force after 1940, as American men went into war. They discuss the differences between states where the mobilization rate of men was high and states with lower mobilization rates. Naturally, the states where more men left for war meant more women could come into the labour force to replace those men, and the study further found that in such states after 1950 those women tended to stay in the labour force. Conversely, in the states where fewer men went to war, women who went into the labour force then dropped out of the labour force after 1950.

The conclusion states:

1. Greater female labour supply reduces female wages. A 10 percent increase in female labour supply relative to male labour supply lowers female wages by 7–8 percent.
2. Greater female labour supply also reduces male wages. A 10 percent increase in relative female labour supply typically lowers male earnings by 3–5 percent.
3. The combination of these two findings indicates that male and female labour inputs are imperfect substitutes
4. The impact of female labour supply on male earnings is not uniform throughout the male earnings distribution. Women drawn into the labour market by the war were closer substitutes for men at the middle of the skill distribution than for those with either the lowest or highest education.

This would seem to be a slam dunk, and seems to completely refutes the point I was making at the start. It is clear from this source that the states where more women joined the labour force actually had a negative impact on wages for both genders. This would seem to confirm what people imagine what the effects are of women joining the labour force. The men leave, women join the labour force where they previously weren’t working, this increases competition and bam lower wages for all. Plus the source states explicitly that during this period women weren’t perfect substitutes for men with the lowest education, who same men who would overwhelming be the ones who went to war.

Slam dunk, right? How could I possibly come back from this? Let’s keep this in mind and look at other studies and see if we can square this circle.

**Part 3**

[Let’s](https://hbr.org/2018/01/when-more-women-join-the-workforce-wages-rise-including-for-men) look at the next source, When More Women Join the Workforce, Wages Rise — Including for Men by Amanda Weinstein.

After accounting for various other factors that may affect FLFPR and wage growth (e.g., average commute times and housing prices), they key takeaway from the article is that every 10% increase in the female labour force participation rate in a metropolitan area is associated with a 5% increase in median real wages — for both men and women.

The article says there are unanswered questions. Although the research suggests that firms in cities are becoming more productive by hiring more women, the exact mechanism is unclear. Women may increase the competitiveness of labour markets, giving firms the option to choose from a bigger, more qualified pool of candidates. They may also be providing firms with a unique set of skills and perspectives that men do not provide. Women’s inclusion in these office spaces may help firms better represent their customers and understand their customer’s needs, as women now make the vast majority of household decisions and control the lion’s share of consumer spending.

Our next source is: Working women in the city and urban wage growth in the United States by Amanda Weinstein

Amanda tells us that if women entering the labour force impacts the local economy only be increasing the quantity of labour, either because the demand curve has shifted or they are shifting the labour supply curve, we would then expect that their increasing numbers would have no impact at all or would actually drive down wages. This could be especially true if women are entering low-paying female-dominated occupations and industries (either by choice or discrimination, and as an aside, this is the heart of the gender wage gap.). This is the argument that nothing changes when women enter the workforce and that they are taking jobs traditionally being done by men, increasing supply and thus lowering wages for all. But if women are bringing unique and complementary skills into the workforce, then we would expect productivity and efficiency to increase, which increases wages for everyone. This is a more dynamic story than the former and women entering the workforce changes the qualitative aspect of workers, and thus bringing something new to the table helps the business increase productivity. Women bring different skills to the table, and these are complementary, helping raise wages because they raise overall productivity. They are not straight substitutes for men. Also women are now getting Bachelor degrees at a higher rate than men. Also there are certain roles women are better suited for as they make 75% of the household decisions according to research and so with the help of women, businesses are better able to represent their consumers.

[https://imgur.com/CiavCl0](https://imgur.com/CiavCl0)

From Page 600 we see a scatterplot showing female labour force participation rate against the change in median wages. Here we see a strong positive relationship, highlighting the benefits of more participation by women in the workforce. Quote from the source, “The scatter plot shows, for example, that well-educated cities like Boston, Massachusetts, and Stamford, Connecticut, clearly experience higher wage growth than expected based on FLFPRs alone. It also shows that areas like Flint, Michigan, and Youngstown, Ohio, do particularly poorly even more than their lower FLFPR would suggest”

Women may also be replacing less productive men, which would explain the higher wages for men that remain in the market as well as lower participation rates of men over time. Cities with higher MLFPR may be cities where women are having a more difficult time replacing less productive men.

[https://imgur.com/FaPeRHz](https://imgur.com/FaPeRHz)

But the positive effects of women joining the workforce seem to be slowing, and there are diminishing returns. The hypothesis is that because of the gender wage gap, women are not joining industries or occupations that pay the most, and thus are not increasing productivity or GDP. And so the gains from them joining the labour force are not realised. The unique skills they could bring to such roles is missed, and there is lower productivity than what we would see otherwise. Discrimination persists and women are still discouraged from joining certain industries. Childcare and related costs are increasing, and thus many women join jobs that are easier to manage given that they are needed in the home. But these are not high productivity or high paying jobs, and so society at large pays the costs in the form of lost productivity. As women are typically expected to manage the house, it’s harder to have a career and contribute to that high-productivity job.

What does our next source have to say? That would be The Effects of Rising Female Labor Supply on Male Wages by Chinhui Juhn and Dae Il Kim.

They find weak evidence that college-educated women are substitutes for high school dropout men or that college-educated women may be better substitutes for high school dropout men than high school graduate men, thereby widening inequality in the bottom half of the male wage distribution. Instead, they evidence that college-educated women are substitutes for college-educated men and that their rapid entry into the labour market may have actually tempered the growth in male wage inequality in the 1980s.

(Page 25) we get the following quote: “Our results based on all three measures of skill clearly indicate that women increased the relative supply of skill in the economy in the 1980s. This is a break from past trend where women have typically added more labour to the bottom than the top skill categories.” This is an important point that will pay off in the final part of this analysis.

This article examines the extent that rapid increases in female labour supply contributed to rising wage inequality and to declining real wages of less skilled males during the 1980s. They find that (1) female labour supply growth slowed in the 1980s relative to the 1970s, and (2) women increased the relative supply of skill in the economy in the 1980s. These findings are inconsistent with a simple story in which supply shifts among women have played a major role. Instead the paper finds that the rapid inequality growth of the 1980s actually stems from demand side factors and how businesses were asking for different skills than in previous decades, which impacted less skilled males the most. It was not due to the fact that there were now more women in the labour force.

**Part 4**

Let’s go back to the first source. The conclusion is that the wages for both women and men went down in 1940s but the effects were uneven. With states with a greater mobilisation of men for war, it seems that wages for women that entered the workforce during that time grew less than in states with lower mobilisation rates. And so it seems that during this period, women weren't perfect substitutes for men, and thus were perhaps not as productive, and as a result earned less. I read this as the jobs that the men had were predominantly ones that required more physical strength, and when they left for the war, it wasn't as easy to replace them with women, who on average tend not to have the same physical size. Why does that matter? That’s because this is the period whereby women joining the workforce replaced predominantly unskilled workers, and weren’t as productive.

And so as per my previous quote, this is a time when women more typically added labour to the bottom skill categories rather than the top skilled categories. This period is also one where women were not encouraged to get an education and thus could not compete with or replace more educated men.

So we have the following quote:

“Contrary to a common hypothesis in the literature, we also find that women at midcentury were not the closest substitutes for the lowest-education men, but for high school graduate men.”

So I read that as when it comes to education and roles that require softer skills women are close substitute for men in those areas, but when it comes to lower educated men, who overwhelmingly do physical work, women weren't close substitutes for them. And so when it came to the states with the highest mobilisation rates for WW2, you had job openings, but a large increase in supply from women, but who weren't perfect substitutes for the men who left for the war, and thus were a drag on wages for both men and women.

**Conclusion**

Clearly women joining the workforce en masse didn’t lower wages for either men or women. This does not appear anywhere in the data. There is evidence that women joining the workforce during WW2 lowered wages for both men and women, as women were not perfect substitutes for the men they replaced. I’ve already explained how I read that conclusion. However, as more women starting receiving an education, they were substitutes for higher-educated men, and brought unique skills to the table that helped the economy grow faster. This is why we see per capita GDP rising, wages for both men and women rising as more women joined the workforce. From the data, it’s also the case that in most US cities where the proportion of women in the workforce is lower also leads to lower median wage growth and sometimes negative growth. It looks like you now can’t afford to not have women in the workforce. Also, a higher proportion of women are now getting degrees than men, and in many sectors women are replacing low-productivity men helping drive economic growth. Good times.

However, there seems to be diminishing returns to women joining the workforce as ongoing gender discrimination prevents women from joining the highest-productivity jobs, and replacing men in those roles who perhaps aren’t as productive as they could be. Women are discouraged from joining many high productivity sectors, and hence they cannot bring their unique skills to the table and expand the pie for everyone.

I hope you enjoyed my R1!

457,oajsf7,2021-06-30,badeconomics,"Does Zach Goldberg actually show that ""group disparities = discrimination"" is a fallacy?","Disclaimer: I'm absolutely not an expert in this area, I'm writing this mostly to clarify my thinking and to hear feedback on whether I'm making sense!

(Really late edit to clarify that I'm responding to Zach Goldberg's article, not Noah Smith's article.)

In [Noah Smith's recent column on Jewish achievement](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/a-response-to-scott-alexander-on), he links to a [post by Zach Goldberg](https://zachgoldberg.substack.com/p/exposing-the-group-disparities-discrimination) on racial disparities in the US. Goldberg presents some neat data in this article. Beyond that, he argues against the view that ""persistent outcome disparities between racial groups necessarily reflect or result from discrimination.""

It's almost certain that there is at least one other factor besides just racism causing the outcome disparities -- that is a low bar to clear. It's also very likely that not all group disparities are caused by discrimination (and instead could be selective immigration, for example). Goldberg could be correct in his conclusion. However, I don't believe the argument presented in the article is strong and justifies the conclusion.

Goldberg's argument, summarized by his section headings, are as follows:

* Disparities between groups are the norm, not the exception -- even among 'whites'. (Evidence: age/sex-adjusted US-born median personal incomes/SES by self-reported ancestry.)

* Disparities between ancestry groups tend to be fairly persistent across time. And this persistence has no obvious connection to discrimination. (Evidence: same as above, over time)

* Racial disparities in socioeconomic outcomes typically disappear when controlling for differences in cognitive ability. (Evidence: controlling for AFQT scores reduce racial disparities.)

Goldberg concludes with:

> But the truth is that group disparities are likely inevitable in any genetically and culturally diverse population. And this is especially likely to be the case in countries like the US, where immigrant groups (voluntary and involuntary) have typically varied in how they compare (in terms of ability, skills, education etc.) to the average person in their populations of origin. The point is not that discrimination can’t contribute to disparities, but that large disparities exist, emerge, and persist even in its absence (we only don’t pay attention to them because the ancestry groups in question were never or are no longer politicized). The upshot is that it may be impossible to determine the relative contribution of discrimination to disparities. As such, the claim that disparities between whites and African Americans are entirely the product of discrimination (or the fault of ‘white people’) is essentially unfalsifiable and should have no weight in determining public policy. Likewise, the assumption that lingering effects of historical discrimination must matter because we’re not far removed from segregation is also dubious. Those who hold this assumption need to ask themselves: at what point can we finally say that we’re far enough removed from Jim Crow that it no longer exerts a meaningful influence on the outcomes of African Americans? If the answer is ‘when outcomes between them and whites have equalized’, then you’re effectively committing to a standard that may not be possible to meet (and not for want of trying, but for much the same or similar reasons that it isn’t met between the Dutch and Chinese). And anything short of equality of outcomes will always be taken as ‘evidence’ that the effects of systemic racism are still operative.

> To be sure, none of the above entails that nothing can or should be done to address the consequences of inequality and improve the quality of life for all. It only means that, rather than pointlessly obsessing over group disparities and blaming and penalizing groups that ‘do too well’ to artificially uplift those that don’t, we should focus on raising the floor for everyone. And this entails catering to the needs NOT of ancestral groups, but of individuals—be they of Dutch, Acadian, or African ancestry.

The conclusions presented in that very last paragraph are at least possibly reasonable, and I'm not going to touch on them. It's the argument in support of it that I find lacking.

---------------------------------------

I have two main objections to this article:

The first objection is around what it means for discrimination to cause differences in outcomes. If Goldberg's argument is that active prejudice today may not be causing disparities in outcomes today, then this is both stronger but also narrower. His data presented in the third section of the article is closer to support this narrow argument. However, the question of whether outcome differences are caused by past or present discrimination could be more relevant for activists and policymakers. For example, there could be a moral case for restitution if those differences arose from past discrimination.

It's easy to imagine differences in human capital accumulation persisting across time and generations, and Goldberg's data presents evidence of exactly that happening. The basic Lucas endogenous growth model has human capital accumulation across with infinitely-lived agents. More realistically, a child's human capital accumulation likely depends on their parent's human capital (e.g., [vocabulary exposure](https://www.naeyc.org/resources/pubs/tyc/feb2014/the-word-gap) ), direct financial investments (e.g., private school, summer camps), and time investments (which can depend on parental income).

My second objection is that, similar to problems with the ""kitchen sink"" approach to estimating the gender wealth gap (see the [""Bad Controls"" section of the /r/economics Gender Wage Gap FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_genderwagegap)), the effect of race is going to be artificially smaller if you separately control for something that is affected by racial discrimination. This means Goldberg's evidence does not even rule out present discrimination which is contributing to outcome disparities. In fact, the data could instead show the channel (childhood education) of how discrimination creates disparate outcomes today.

It's easy to imagine discrimination today affecting how much a child learns, and thus their AFQT scores. From a very brief search, there's [evidence that teacher expectations affect student performance](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/09/18/161159263/teachers-expectations-can-influence-how-students-perform). There's been evidence that [teachers may give students different grades, in this example based on gender](https://ideas.time.com/2013/02/06/do-teachers-really-discriminate-against-boys/). [A study found teachers in India discriminate based on caste](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w15057/w15057.pdf).

Overall, it could be the case that outcome disparities of some racial groups are due to non-discrimination factors like selective immigration. That does not rule out discrimination as a cause for outcome disparities of other groups. More importantly, the fact that outcomes of newly-immigrating minorities are better than those of minorities who grew up in the US is consistent with both of these sources of discrimination which Goldberg does not rule out. Newly-immigrating minorities would not have parents who suffered from discrimination in the past, nor would present discrimination have decreased their human capital accumulation today.",abetadist,t2_3lq2j,0.87,107,49

459,49k23i,2016-03-08,badeconomics,"The problem with controlling for ""all other factors"" when looking at pay discrimination","This comes up most often on Reddit in regards to gender pay inequality, but it applies to any time when we're looking at any form of labor discrimination. When the issue of pay inequality is brought up there's always several comments pointing out that when controlling for ""all other factors"" most of the difference goes away. This is essentially victim blaming, and shows up in comments that often take the form of ""but women work less hours than men"" or something similar.

Here's an example to show why ""controlling"" for other factors doesn't mean that we should wholesale ignore the impact those factors contribute to the problem:

* Let's assume we have a simple market described [by these labor curves](https://i.imgur.com/ZCFZ34y.png)
* All the workers in this market share the same supply of labor curve
* All the employers in the market discriminate against 1/2 of the workers in the market, which results in 2nd, lower, demand for labor curve.
* If we study this market we'll see clearly that one group earns substantially less, and if control for all other factors we can see that the difference in hourly wages between the two is 10% ($50 vs $45)
* But we also see that the 2nd group of works only chooses to work about 91% as many hours as the 1st group.
* We could naively we blame the 2nd group for choosing to work less, control for that variable, and determine that the true cost of discrimination in this population is 10%
* But if recognize that both groups are making the exact same decisions in regards to the amount they're willing to work at every wage level, we can see that the actual effect of the discrimination is a 19% reduction in earnings.

Now obviously, it's possible that the two groups might develop different supply of labor curves. And in reality it's extremely difficult to figure out the shape of the labor curves in any single industry, never mind over different geographies and also taking in to account the many different ways that different groups can face wage discrimination.


But I hope that the point is clear - controlling for a variable isn't a magic wand that can untangle all the interrelated co-dependencies of even an extremely simple market like the one above.

460,4d6k5f,2016-04-03,badeconomics,Review of the week 5: Deeply Bayesian Sociology,"The subject of this morning's RI is [this paper](http://genderbias.net/docs/resources/guideline/Does%20bad%20pay%20cause%20occupations%20to%20feminize,%20Does%20feminization%20reduce%20pay,%20and%20How%20can%20we%20tell%20with%20longitudinal.pdf) as cited in [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/upshot/as-women-take-over-a-male-dominated-field-the-pay-drops.html?_r=0). The thesis of the article is in the title: *""As Women Take Over a Male-Dominated Field, the Pay Drops""*.

The quote we'll investigate is this one from sociologist Paula England:

    Once women start doing a job, “It just doesn’t look like it’s as
    important to the bottom line or requires as much skill,”

Which is a conclusion supposed to be drawn from [England (2012)](http://www.statisticalhorizons.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/88.2.levanon.pdf) . This is what's called the ""devaluation theory"" in the wage gap literature, the view that male centric work is seen as ""more valuable"", basically the *pure discrimination* view. 

Now we'll leave the obvious criticism of the quote aside for today. This criticism is basically supply and demand -- when women start doing a traditionally man dominated job, aggregate supply of worker increases and hence market price lowers. Then there is the issue of drawing causal inference in these sorts of statistical exercises which was talked about [here some time ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/49k23i/the_problem_with_controlling_for_all_other/) and [Levine(2003)](http://www.policyalmanac.org/economic/archive/pay_equity.pdf) addresses as such:

>     Whether women limit their fields of work in order to fulfill family responsibilities or discrimination confines
    women to certain jobs, the market’s wage response is the same: the abundant supply of women to certain jobs 
    relative to employer demand will prompt firms to use more women than otherwise and, in hiring each 
    new worker, spread complementary inputs (e.g.,  capital)  more  thinly;  this,  in  turn,  decreases  the  
    productivity  of  workers  in female-dominated jobs, and consequently, their earnings.

Basically, you can't imply any sort of causality when observing an effect in this context.

But let's leave all of these completely valid criticisms aside. Instead, let us focus on Ms. England's body of work supporting the quote. To do this, we need to [go back to 2007](http://genderbias.net/docs/resources/guideline/Does%20bad%20pay%20cause%20occupations%20to%20feminize,%20Does%20feminization%20reduce%20pay,%20and%20How%20can%20we%20tell%20with%20longitudinal.pdf), 5 years before the 2012 article supporting the quote. In this article titled *""Does Bad Pay Cause Occupations to Feminize""*, England first does a literature review on wage gap, citing 5 articles, all using longitudinal data, then uses a panel data model to differentiate itself from previous methodology. 

The idea is to test whether the devaluation theory is plausible, or if lower paying jobs attracted women (which remember from above, *we can't know using these methods*). She briefly contemplates the competing theory (that wage differential is partly explainable by non-wage compensation, like time flexibility), but notes it is espoused by ""neoclassical economists"".

Now a few things are to be noted here. First, she uses the words ""causal effects"" in situations where this is distressingly not applicable. More importantly, all of the longitudinal studies all state findings of evidence for the devaluation theory from studying the evolution of wage and the man/woman proportion in the industry overtime. 

Also, let's call the ""longitudinal methods"" they use what they are: distributed lag models. As any undergrad will tell you, you should test for stationarity whenever you have an AR(p) component in a model, yet, none of this literature ever does this. Not once is are the words ""station"", ""unit root"", or ""difference"" mentionned in any of these papers.

Now England (2007), using panel data does not find any relevant effects supporting devaluation theory, and notes that the previous studies were in all likelihood suffering from omitted variable bias. Note that England (2007)'s panel model also uses an AR(p) component not testing for non-stationarity, so I'd take all of this lightly, but maybe I'm asking too much. She notes:

>  One interpretation is simply
that the reported association between occupations’ sex composition and wages has
always been spurious rather than causal, due to some unidentified omitted variable. [...] This is not our interpretation, however.

She then proceeds to tell a 3 page story (founded in no empirics whatsoever) explaining away her results. And, in 2012, 5 years later, she publishes the paper linked above, where she uses the same bad time series methodology as the papers she critiqued herself in her literature review, and finds the same results as the stated literature. This is what's quoted in the NYT article published this week.

462,9tyrgw,2018-11-04,badeconomics,"Omitted Variable Bias and the ""Costs"" of Ethnic Diversity","Haven't posted in a good long while, so let's get down to it.

Because I'm a filthy SJW, I sometimes lurk /r/socialjustice101.  Today, I saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialjustice101/comments/9ts2f6/how_to_talk_about_the_down_sides_of_high/) post, which draws heavily from [this](http://economicsdetective.com/2016/07/costs-ethnic-diversity-garett-jones/) podcast episode.  The post basically makes claims that ethnic diversity reduces group performance, productivity, and has other undesirable features.  We'll talk through some simple econometrics first, then I'll address why making the claim that ethnic diversity is causally-related to the aforementioned outcomes MUST be made with care, and that in the case of the podcast/blog and the post in general, it usually isn't.  Indeed, many of the papers cited don't even make that claim (or even the claims attributed to them).

To clarify, I'm not making the claim that diversity has positive economics effects, merely that the negative effects mentioned in the OP are misstated, overstated, or in some cases, are inherently unknowable in their current specification.  Let's get started.

&#x200B;

# 1.) Basic Intuition

Spurious correlations are all around us.  Ice cream sales are correlated with drownings.  Obesity rates correlate with the housing bubble.  We've all heard the maxim *correlation doesn't imply causation*, but it can be a hard thing to shake ourselves out of, especially when faced with messy causal inference we find intuitive.  For instance, it may be intuitive for some to observe that increasing the aggregate number of differences in a population would make that population less productive.  What goes unanswered here is the question: ""why might ethnic differences make a country less productive?""  No doubt you could make some broad appeal that ethnic homogeneity creates a sense of community germane to greater cooperation, and indeed that is the claim, but usually made in the reverse: that groups in diverse societies have low trust/sympathy for other groups dissimilar from themselves.

The subtle point here is that *racial mistrust or animus* is the channel through which productivity falls, not racial diversity.  The thing to consider here is the unobserved counterfactual: that a country with high ethnic diversity, but no racism, has an unknown (though possibly nonnegative) relationship between productivity and diversity.  This might seem like splitting hairs, but it's actually quite important in contending with the idea that racial diversity leads to bad outcomes.  But let's formalize things a little...

# 

# 2.) Econometric Intuition

Consider the simple linear regression model

log(**productivity\_i )= β\_0 + β\_1\*diversity\_i + δ\*controls\_i+ ε\_i**

Let's say productivity\_i is the number of widgets produced by country *i*, the first beta term is an intercept term, and the second is the coefficient on diversity (let's say that's indexed by the probability that two random draws from the population of country *i* are from different ethnic groups).  Delta is a vector of coefficients for *n* country-level controls for country *i.*  Epsilon is the idiosyncratic error term associated with country *i*.  Let's say I regress productivity on diversity and find a negative coefficient, say -1.04.  Broadly speaking, that means (conditional on our controls) a 1-point increase in the probability that two random draws are from different ethnic groups leads to a 4% decrease in widgets produced.

Now, the first question we need to ask ourselves is this: is it feasible that racism could depress the productivity of a nation?  I think a simple appeal to a Becker discrimination model says that it could since in equilibrium, firms are willing to forgo profits in order to compensate their discriminatory tastes.

So, inasmuch as racism is living out there in the wilds of the error term, that's a problem.  Why?  Consider the equation for our estimate of the coefficient on diversity:

**β\_1(estimate)=β\_1(true)+\[Covariance(diversity, ε)/n\*variance(diversity)\]**

In order for our estimate of the effect of diversity on productivity to be unbiased, it needs to be the case that the covariance between the error term and the independent variable MUST be zero, which means (loosely speaking) that the independent variable must be uncorrelated with the error term.  But is it reasonable to assume that racism and diversity are uncorrelated?  That seems like an UNREASONABLY strong claim, especially given the evidence to the contrary cited by OP themselves.

In the above equation, everything in braces \[ \] is bias in our estimate of the effect of diversity on productivity.  How biased is our estimate, and in what direction?  It depends on the (unobserved) correlations between racism and diversity AND racism and productivity.  But this is precisely my point: ***until we control for racism, it is impossible to detect the effect of diversity on productivity.***

&#x200B;

\*\*\*A Caveat

In the case where racism is jointly determined by diversity and productivity, controlling for racism introduces selection bias by conditioning on a collider.  I'm not sympathetic to the view that this is reality, but am open to hearing the case argued.

&#x200B;

# 3.) Addressing the Cited Sources

These sources almost all cite each other, so I'll discuss them in classes:

&#x200B;

1.) Summary Papers: Williams & O'Reilly (1996) and Alesina & La Porta (2005)

Both papers begin their discussion sections by saying the evidence against racial diversity is mixed and that policies of racial homogenization are undesirable in both the short and long run.  The blog post/podcast straight up misrepresents the findings of W&O, and pick a bizarre theoretical finding from A&LaP that hurts their overall claim (going from no ethnic heterogeneity to no ethnic homogeneity only reduces growth by 2%).

&#x200B;

2.) Empirical Papers: Habyarimana et al (2007), Stazyk et al (2012), Parotta, et al (2014a)

More misrepresented findings here.  Habyarimana and co-authors' paper is an experimental (yay!) paper that examines behavior of various ethnic groups in cooperative games.  I actually love this one passage from the paper:

>*A major implication of our findings is that generating higher levels of public goods provision in diverse communities does not require the segregation of ethnic groups, as many preference-based or technology-based explanations might suggest.* ***Indeed, just the opposite may be needed: policies that promote repeated social interactions and the free flow of information across ethnic lines***.

Stazyk and co-authors find that increasing racial diversity in workplaces decreases productivity, but that decreased productivity goes away in the presence of effective diversity management programs.  Parotta's structural model assumes that workers have disutility from working with people of different ethnic groups (so racism, basically).

&#x200B;

There are others, but at this point, I'm tired, and this is effort-posty enough IMO.

&#x200B;

# 4.) Some Final Thoughts

I have no doubts that returns to diversity can be negative in the short run.  The U.S.'s painful experience with integration shows that.  The entry of women into the workforce during the 70s shows that.  However, to quote Alesina and La Porta ""The implication of promoting racial homogeneity is unappealing and probably incorrect both in the short and in the long run. "" My claim is that there is an underlying variable or variables that explains the negative relationship (inasmuch as it exists) between racial diversity and productivity or other economic outcomes.  Hence, policy prescriptions to address the ""costs"" of racial diversity should focus on the true culprit of its negative effects.",iamelben,t2_580t2,0.86,104,30
463,esthym,2020-01-23,badeconomics,How I learned to stop worrying (or at least worry less) about R^2 in the social sciences,"There are a few comments in this thread we could talk about, but I'm going to focus on [this one](https://np.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/ermg5c/explained_with_uncanny_accuracy_in_a_classic_meme/ffabk22/), particularly, the notion that a model in social sciences with a low R^2 value immediately means the model is useless, as exemplified by this:

> Just for fucking fun I decided to recreate the chart in excel. The fucking r-squared is roughly 50%.

Before we get into it, for transparency's sake I should say that I have not read what the original thread is referring to substantively, so I can't comment on the study mentioned per se, this is purely a RI about R^2 .

Anyways, it is true that R^2 represents the amount of variance captured by your model (edited per /u/brberg’s comment below) but I have a few points about why this is not necessarily super important assuming you care about causality and not just prediction. I'm not going to go too in depth, just because I've discussed this throughout my comment history, but here we go:

* Want to get a high R^2 value? Just add more variables to your regression. (For this section, you can use [this](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php) to view the LaTeX equations, aka the stuff between dollar signs): That's because R^2 is just the residual sum of squares, `$\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(\hat{y}_i-\bar{y})^2$` divided by the total sum of squares, `$\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2$`, where we're talking about a dataset with n values marked indexed by i, associated with a predicted (or modeled) value y-hat. If you add more variables SSR is necessarily non-increasing, which is nicely explained [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/167827/why-is-sum-of-squared-residuals-non-increasing-when-adding-explanatory-variable). As a result, you really shouldn't be as concerned about the proportion of the variance in the outcome variable that is predictable from a single predictor... a lot of different things could affect your outcome, especially in the social sciences where units are highly heterogeneous. [Taken from an old comment of mine here](https://np.reddit.com/r/OpenEconomics/comments/a79oz9/update_on_lrnm_argument_the_honor_of_robert_lucas/ec1zy7z/).


* Ok you say, then just consider adjusted R^2 which penalizes for the extra terms you include in the regression. Well, you might be able to explain more variation, but if you're interested in causal inference then you have to be careful about including ""bad"" controls, aka conditioning on a collider. Consider [this example from another old comment about the gender pay gap](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/brzo5t/more_good_than_bad_kamala_harriss_equal_pay/eokmnte/). Guess which of the two models has a higher adjusted R^2 value? Hint: the wrong one! Also you might be overfitting, which the next point gets at.

> This is obviously an extraordinarily simplified example, but consider this data-generating process as a toy model of why controlling for A, B, C, and D, (or just A in this case) when said variables come downstream of the causal pathway is a bad idea. This was written in R, if you're familiar with the software.

    male <- rbinom(n=1000, size=1, prob=0.5)
    wages <-  2*male + rnorm(1000)
    hours_worked <- wages + rnorm(1000)
    
    lm(wages ~ male)
    lm(wages ~ male + hours_worked)

> There's a hardcoded gender wage gap of ""2"" here, and notice that wages are purely a function of gender (i.e. discrimination) and not hours worked. The second regression will produce a biased estimate of the effect of gender on wages (you will underestimate this effect). It does not mean it doesn't exist!

> Scott Cunningham, in pages 74-78 of his [book on causal inference](http://scunning.com/cunningham_mixtape.pdf) goes through this example as an example of collider bias and I think he does so quite nicely (plus, it's in Stata, if you're unfamiliar with R).

> Of course we don't know that this is the true data-generating process: the point is that just because the gender pay gap diminishes when we control for these sorts of variables does not mean that discrimination does not exist.

* [Here](https://twitter.com/nickchk/status/1191114004120264704) are some graphical examples about why higher values of R^2 could mean a worse model, from Nick Huntington-Klein's Twitter.

* And finally, [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/analisereal/status/1182738974604845056) makes these similar points nicely with a policy example:

> Imagine you are studying a population in which everyone has a very serious disease, except one person. Then, of course, you find that the disease explains little variation in happiness. Would you then conclude that the ""effects are too small to warrant policy change""? Surely not. The low ""variance explained"" is due to low variation in exposure, but the effect of an intervention could be huge. Thus, if screen time affects one's happiness substantially, but almost everyone in the population has the same exposure to screen time, then screen time will surely explain little variation in happiness, since there is low variation of the exposure to begin with.

---

I'm not saying R^2 doesn't matter or we should throw it away entirely. That said, in the social sciences [we should worry less about these values than in the hard sciences](https://np.reddit.com/r/OpenEconomics/comments/a79oz9/update_on_lrnm_argument_the_honor_of_robert_lucas/ec24bdc/). Why? 

Units are far more heterogenous in the social sciences! Every single carbon atom is the same, but every human is different. This is exactly why we have to use randomization to get at causality as opposed to being able to create a perfectly controlled environment like in the lab sciences.  /u/rationalities was [trying to make this same point in the original thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/ermg5c/explained_with_uncanny_accuracy_in_a_classic_meme/ffal6u2/). See also their point [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/esjiks/vat_is_always_paid_by_the_consumer_bonus_bad/ffbxang/). 

Social science outcomes are highly complex and have many causes, so it's unlikely that any particular model will be able to explain all of the variation in an outcome perfectly, or even above a certain threshold, especially when just using a single variable model. We have to work probabilistically, not deterministically.

So be wary of R^2, especially when the regression includes many predictors be sure to look at adjusted R^2 but even still, don't put so much weight on it if you care about causality. It may not matter anyway.

Note the scare quotes -- I'm not going to single out any one comment from that thread because I don't think any single comment rises to the level of badeconomics per se, but I think it will be useful for many of us to have some clarity in regards to the epistemological limits of empirical research. 

I will couch this discussion in terms of gender, but everything that follows is applicable to any situation in which we attempt to obtain causal estimates from observational data.

## The causal effect of gender

Suppose we are interested in the effect that (biological) gender has on some outcome variable (let's specifically consider ""aggression,"" which is something that was mentioned more than once in the wage-gap thread). We are interested in the additional amount of aggression that one exhibits as a result of being a man as opposed to a female, on average. Symbolically, we are interested in discovering:

E(A^(M)|M) - E(A^(F)|M) = E(A^(M)-A^(F)|M),

where A^M is the aggression level of a man, and E is the [expected-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) operator (the mean). We can think of this expression as the average difference in aggression that we would expect to see if we changed someone from female to male (in economics this is called a ""~~local~~ average treatment effect""). The term E(A^(F)|M) indicates what level of aggression men would have on average if they were born a female (this is known as the ""counterfactual""). Obviously this is not something that we observe in the real world, so our goal as empiricists is to use data to make some kind of statement about the true (but unobserved!) value.

So we go out into the world and collect data on aggression levels by gender, then compare the means. Due to the [law of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), our sample will converge to the true population mean:

E(A^(M)|M) - E(A^(F)|F).

If we add and subtract the term E(A^(F)|M) and rearrange, we get:

E(A^(M)-A^(F)|M) + E(A^(F)|M) - E(A^(F)|F).

Our first term is the causal effect that we are trying to estimate. However, we are left with the additional expression E(A^(F)|M) - E(A^(F)|F). This expression (called ""selection bias"") is unobserved. The difference in aggression levels that we observe is a combination of the true causal effect of gender that we care about and an additional, unobserved component. To make a statement about the true value of our causal effect, we need to account for this unobserved influence.

---

## Randomization

In general, the best and most intuitive way to account for this unobserved bias is to randomize selection into the two groups. From our sample, we randomly draw some number of women who will then change their sex. Since this group was randomly selected, we would expect that any changes in aggression that we observe post sex change can be attributed solely to sex. 

In this instance, randomization is, of course, impossible. This means that we must find some other way to account for our unobserved selection bias. Absent randomization, however, we don't have any way to directly account for E(A^(F)|M) (the average aggression of females who are also men). We might be tempted to think about women who transition to become male, but this won't work because these women are likely different from women who don't transition along other dimensions (including aggression), and therefore our average will be skewed.

What we are left with, then, is an unobserved component that cannot be accounted for in the data. To make a statement about the causal effect of gender, we must make *untestable* assumptions about this unobserved value. If we believe that [testability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verificationism) is a fundamental property of science, then any statement we make about the causal effects of gender are necessarily unscientific.

---

## Omitted variable bias

Everything discussed so far can be translated into the standard OLS framework that we all learned in our undergraduate econometrics course. We are interested in estimating the equation 

A = a + bM + e,

where M is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the observation is male. We would like for our estimate of b to be an unbiased estimate of our causal effect of M on A. For this to be the case, however, we need to make the [standard assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares#Assumptions).

We know these assumptions are likely to be violated, however. Strict exogeneity isn't satisfied: there is a strong cultural component to gender that also affects behavior. This culture variable is therefore correlated with A and M. If it is omitted from our regression, then our estimate of b will be biased. 

This, unfortunately, is the most pernicious form of omitted variable bias that we can have. The cultural variable is positively correlated with male biology (boys are expected to be ""boys"") *and* is positively correlated with aggression (part of being a ""boy"" is being aggressive). We can therefore put a sign on the bias; our estimate of b is going to be larger than the true causal effect. If we observe a positive effect of M on A (men are more aggressive), we are unable to say *anything* about the *true* effect of M on A (other than that it is *smaller* than what we observe). In fact, the true effect could even be *negative* -- we are simply unable to make any sort of statistical claim about the true value. It doesn't matter how large an effect we see, or how often we see it; the data do not allow us to make any claim about the magnitude or direction of the true effect.

---

As was pointed out on the other wage-gap thread, everything I have said here also applies to identifying the causal effect of culture. But that's the point -- we can't separately identify the effects of culture from the effects of biology. None of this should be interpreted as saying ""biology doesn't matter,"" because that's committing the same mistake in the other direction. It's unverifiable, and as scientists we should therefore remain agnostic.

Situations like this are more common than any scientist would like to admit. However, failing to address these issues can lead to unscientific and unfounded inference on data. As scientists, we should remain vigilant against such scenarios and call attention to people drawing erroneous conclusions from bad data. ",bon_pain,t2_1522n3,0.91,56,63
466,56kvm0,2016-10-09,badeconomics,You gotta outline your assumptions mannnnn,"In this R1 I wish to critique two arguments I often see in Gender Wage Gap threads, because they are related to same point. 

First is when people claim that there, logically, cannot be a gender wage gap, because then firms would fire men and hire only women. This arbitrage will eliminate anything preventing wages from equaling marginal productivity (and therefore reflecting value added to the business).

Second is when people link to an audit study and act like that’s enough to prove discriminatory gap (it isn’t)

Both of these mistakes have the same root cause, which is assuming a structural model of the labor market, but rarely are they explicit about this.
 
I will **not** be claiming a particular structural model is more plausible than another or better fits the data. That is beyond my knowledge of the subject, if you have this knowledge, feel free to comment and add on. I just wish to highlight that both of these arguments are reliant on certain structural assumptions that are *rarely* stated.

___

First, let us consider a common claim , see [here]( https://np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/551qjo/how_to_eliminate_the_gender_wage_gap/d8704vl?context=3&st=iu23swy7&sh=8274a517).


>Easiest business plan ever for profits. Only hire women, at 77% the price. Free 23% profit, right?


Let’s talk about the simplest (not necessarily the most realistic) model that will make this argument true. This is Becker’s Taste for Discrimination + perfectly competitive labor markets.

In Becker’s taste for discrimination some firms don’t like hiring X group and pay them less and pocket the difference as compensation for dealing with this group that they don’t like to hire. This means that discrimination will be affected through a market process. 

See [relevant Heckman]( http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.12.2.101)

>The impact of market discrimination is not determined by the most discriminatory participants in the market, or even by the average level of discrimination among firms, but rather by the level of discrimination at the firms where ethnic minorities or women actually end up buying, working and borrowing. It is at the margin that economic values are set. This point is largely ignored in the papers in this symposium.

Basically what Heckman means here is it doesn’t matter if the average firm is a discriminator, it matters if the firm that hires the minority is a discriminator. The reasoning is actually very similar to why marginal costs matter much more than average costs. 
This marginal firm leads us to two important conclusions about the labor market for the group we are looking at. 

If

1.	There are not enough non-discriminatory firms to hire all the group members

2.	 The group members cannot easily find these non-discriminatory firms

We will likely see a wage gap. Fortunately in this one, we have assumed option 2 away because we have perfectly competitive labor markets. The group’s members know exactly how many openings non-discriminatory firms offer, because of perfect information. 

So let’s focus on 1. If there are enough firms in the industry to employ all this disadvantaged group, we will see no wage gap. It doesn’t matter if discriminatory firms exist, the group will be able to avoid them easily. If a firm offers discriminatory wages and someone takes it, they will be offered scooped up by the non-discriminatory firm. These discriminatory wage gaps will not exist in equilibrium. This seems to basically be the argument presented above (but not really fleshed out).

If there aren’t enough non-discriminatory firms, things get more dicey. The group will be forced to take jobs at discriminatory firms. Furthermore, even nondiscriminatory firms will pay lower wages. This is because they can take this disadvantaged group from these discriminatory firms, so if they paid wages = marginal product, they could fire there current workers and hire from the worker pool at discriminatory firms. This will grant these firms economic profits. 

If we have free entry (another assumption) and the firms entering with free entry aren’t discriminators (another assumption), we will see non-discriminators drive out discriminators. Essentially, the fact they *don’t* have a discriminatory preferences gives them a competitive advantage, much like them being a firm with say, more efficient technology. They can hire labor cheaper.

If we don’t have free entry and not enough non-discriminatory firms, or the firms entering are discriminators, then we will see a wage gap. Competition will not eliminate the wage gap. Strangely enough, this case is actually perfectly efficient. This is because preferences are exogenous, much like the weather. I think it is often underappreciated how odd exogenous preferences is as an assumption at times.

Finally, I will note that relaxing 2 can lead to a mess. Even if there are enough non-discriminatory firms, non-discriminators will know that marginalized groups have less bargaining power and will, for profit seeking reasons, offer them less. For example, marginalized groups could face more stringent search frictions (e.g. they have a harder time finding a firm without a taste for discrimination) and firms could know they have more leverage over them as a result and offer them less money, even though they have no taste for discrimination themselves. There are lots of ways we could go with this and maybe you could add other features that counter act these factors and reduce/eliminate the wage gap. However, my point still stands that you need to specifically outline these features, not claim it’s logically incoherent for there to be a wage gap.

Next I will go after the citations I see of audit studies where it is found that the average firm is a discriminator. I actually think many of these are correct and the average firm *is* a discriminator. However, this brings us back to the marginal firm vs. average firm problem.

Heckman again

> The impact of market discrimination is not determined by the most discriminatory participants in the market, or even by the average level of discrimination among firms, but rather by the level of discrimination at the firms where ethnic minorities or women actually end up buying, working and borrowing. It is at the margin that economic values are set. This point is largely ignored in the papers in this symposium.

This is why I lumped them together. The problem is these audit studies (say, comparing resumes that are the same except for the race of the applicant). They cannot tell us how easily the applicant can *dodge* discrimination. Sure, marginalized groups may be less likely to get interviews and jobs, but if they can still find those non-discriminatory jobs, they won’t have a discriminatory gap.

To use an extreme example, I may have 100 job offers, 99 will give me a discriminator gap and 1 does not. I will not actually suffer from discrimination.*

*I don’t find this plausible. More accurately, I’d worry audit studies might overstate discrimination, by not factoring in marginalized groups ability to dodge discrimination. (If anyone has evidence that this is or is not happening, please post it)


These groups being able to dodge it easily will be reliant on no search frictions and having enough non-discriminatory employers, for the as reasons I mentioned about.

____

All in all, I suspect both sides are reliant on more assumptions than I outlined (I mentioned mostly perfectly competitive labor markets and only one type of discrimination). However, I wanted to focus on the \# of non-discriminatory firms and how easily marginalized groups can find them, because those are key structural parameters that most of these arguments completely ignore. It’s not that these arguments are wrong per se, it’s that they are incomplete.

Because women have access to the birth control pill now and can compete in the same domains as men roughly speaking there is a real practical problem here. It's partly an economic problem now because **when I was roughly your age, it was still possible for a one-income family to exist. Well you know that wages have been flat except in the upper 1% since 1973. Why? Well, it's easy. What happens when you double the labor force? What happens? You halve the value of the labor. So now we're in a situation where it takes two people to make as much as one did before. So we went from a situation where women's career opportunities were relatively limited to where there they were relatively unlimited and there were two incomes (and so women could work) to a situation where women have to work and they only make half as much as they would have otherwise.** Now we're going to go in a situation—this is the next step—where women will work because men won't. And that's what's coming now. There was an Economist article showing that 50% now of boys in school are having trouble with their basic subject. Look around you in universities—you can see this happening. I've watched it over decades. I would say 90% of the people in my personality class are now women. There won't be a damn man left in university in ten years except in the STEM fields. And it's a complete bloody catastrophe. And it's a catastrophe for women because I don't know where the hell you're gonna find someone to, you know, marry and have a family with if this keeps happening. ...

468,597wqm,2016-10-25,badeconomics,Hillary's Economically Clueless Plans Will Create Poverty,"So, [this] (https://fee.org/articles/hillarys-economically-clueless-plans-will-create-poverty/) article is a ‘fisking’ of Clinton’s economic plan meant to show how, as the title suggests, Clinton will create poverty. This article was written by an actual economist (though the fact that he has elected to work with highly conservative think tanks and tends towards more politics than economics says a lot) who resorts to calling Clinton and the OECD and basically anyone he politically disagrees with ‘statists’.

However, not only is there never an argument made about how Clinton would increase poverty (besides some insinuation about the minimum wage), the short spurts of analysis he deems fit to provide are riddled with bad assumptions and misleading applications of statistics. I am going to focus mainly on the claims that he puts some substance into, because this article covers a lot of different subjects.

After getting past the first few paragraphs which are used to basically show how *ridiculous* statists are, he gets into the actual economics.

> A laudable sentiment, for sure, but it’s important at this point to ask what is meant by “poverty.” If we’re talking about wretched material deprivation, what’s known as “absolute poverty,” then we have good news. Virtually nobody in the United States is in that tragic category (indeed, one of great success stories in recent decades is that fewer and fewer people around the world endure this status).
But if we’re talking about the left’s new definition of poverty (promoted by the statists at the OECD), which is measured relative to a nation’s median level of income, then you can have “poverty” even if nobody is poor.


While not technically wrong that you could have poverty without ‘true’ poverty, it seems disingenuous to imply that because there is no “absolute poverty” in the US, there is no poverty at all. Poverty looks different in different countries and what makes you poor in India does not make you poor in America. Poverty is measured not only in strictly how much money you make, but also by what you can purchase with that money and how that compares to your country’s standard of living. 

The US has ~~one of the worst child poverty rates in the developed world~~  and [17% of households with children experience food insecurity] (http://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/impact-of-hunger/hunger-and-poverty/hunger-and-poverty-fact-sheet.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/).

Saying that just because almost no one in the US makes less than 2 dollars a day that we shouldn't worry about poverty is a farce.

Note: The OECD measure of poverty is definitely flawed as rightly pointed out in the comments, but seems to [line up](http://www.nccp.org/topics/childpoverty.html) with federal government estimates which use an absolute line (although it does overestimate it). Furthermore, an [OECD report](https://www.oecd.org/els/family/43570328.pdf) taking a multi-dimensional approach to child well being similarly finds the US lacking, meaning that efforts aimed at improving child welfare in this country are not without merit as the author seems to be suggesting.

> If Obama gets credit for the good numbers of 2015, then shouldn’t he be blamed for the bad numbers between 2009-2014? Shouldn’t it matter that there are still more people in poverty in 2015 than there were in 2008? And is it really good news that it’s taken Obama so long to finally get median income above the 2008 level, particularly when you see how fast income grew during the Reagan boom?

For someone calling out misleading statistics he seems to have a penchant for them.

Even if there are more people in poverty, the percentage of people poor or near poor in 2015 is the exact same as it was in 2008 (table 6 from [here] (http://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-people.html)).

Also, median income per household (when adjusting for number of household members) is now the highest it has been since before the tech bubble burst and arguably the [highest ever] (http://imgur.com/XW78Qqc) (and this is not even counting the variety of [other reasons] (http://www.vox.com/2016/9/15/12915038/census-income-report) why census numbers on income growth understate it).

This all of course is ignoring the fact that putting the 2009-2010 numbers on Obama when they were results of the Great Recession, which was unequivocally not his fault, is absurd. When looking at the past 3 or so years, his administration seems more culpable but even then president's do not have an overwhelming impact on economic policy and much of the blame/ subsequent adulation should go towards the Fed.

Reagan era economic policy has its own problems. Reagan came into office facing huge (by American standards) inflation and initially passed  huge tax cuts for the upper brackets to spur growth. 

However, this did not create a recovery until around the time Reagan was forced to roll back many of the cuts, coincidentally around the same time that Volcker, arguably the true 'savior' of the economy, was able to tame inflation so he could stop hitting the economy with negative demand shocks, allowing for a rapid recovery.

Furthermore, the growth rate experienced after this recovery of was not atypical and in fact were similar to the growth rates during the post-70's recession boom.

Obama faced a different task altogether; instead of facing inflation, which we can deal with (although not super easily), he instead faced the collapse of much of the financial sector while interest rates/inflation was very low, and his reaction accordingly was very different than Reagan's.

Obama faced a demand driven recession while we were at the ZLB, giving him significantly fewer options to deal with the recession, and even then the US recovery outperformed most other nations. While GDP growth has been anemic, it has also trended downwards over time since at least the 70's (and this is a pattern most developed countries seem to be following). Job and wage growth however have ended up being pretty good.

Lastly, just like to add that Obama's flagship economic policy, the 'bailout', is [overwhelmingly supported by economists.] (http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_0qeKwxLWkDyiwjX)

> The comment about equal pay sounds noble, though I strongly suspect it is based on dodgy data and that she really favors the very dangerous idea of “comparable worth” legislation, which would lead to bureaucrats deciding the value of jobs.

Here he links to [his own blog post about the subject] (https://danieljmitchell.wordpress.com/2015/04/15/equal-pay-day-economic-illiteracy-and-hillary-hypocrisy/), and you can refer to any of the many great posts made in this sub about why this 'debunking' of the gender pay gap is wrong, but the thrust of the argument is

1. Holding a bunch of variables constant to explain away the gap gives you a misleading answer because the things you are holding constant is what is causing the gap in the first place (and seem to be caused by societal norms that negatively impact women, i.e. sexism). Pre-market discrimination is still discrimination, and even then when you control for these variables a (small) [gender gap still emerges] (http://www.hawaii.edu/religion/courses/Gender_Wage_Gap_Report.pdf).

2. Saying that businesses should just hire women and reap the profits of cheap labor seems to miss that discrimination is 

a) a preference firms choose to pay for, 

b) this assumes free entry for non-discriminatory (or less discriminatory) firms, 

c) assumes those discriminated against have perfect information and can find the non-discriminatory firms without cost, and 

d) the average amount of discrimination is not the same as the marginal amount of discrimination.

>That minimum wage would do absolutely nothing to businesses. History has proven that the implementation of a minimum wage and subsequent increases have not caused job losses whatsoever.

So, he's either being slippery or doesn't understand the implications of a minimum wage rise fully. The issue with raising the minimum wage is not just the *level* of employment--not just whether employed people today will be unemployed tomorrow--but the effect on future employment growth, or whether somebody doesn't get a job when they otherwise might've done. 

Of course, we can't discuss the minimum wage and its effects without mentioning the 2006 [Neumark and Wascher](http://www.nber.org/papers/w12663) meta-analysis. But, perhaps something more recent would be better: [Dube](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2014/06/19_hamilton_policies_addressing_poverty/state_local_minimum_wage_policy_dube.pdf) finds that the disemployment effects of a $15/hr would likely outweigh the welfare gain of those remaining in employment. 

>Corporate profits are so high these days

As far as I know, this is also [false](http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Decoupling-of-wages-and-productivity.pdf), provided you aren't using a completely insignificant length of time. Over the past few decades, capital's share of income has remained pretty stable, with a probably transitory rise post-2001 due to the housing sector.

>therefore helping boost consumption and aggregate demand in an economy

I don't have any literature, but I'm thinking the whole ""raising the minimum wage will boost AD"" argument has very little credence. Especially during a recession, for the same reason countercyclical tax breaks don't really work. 

>it will increase productivity, as the efficient wage theory states.

I have no idea if the Efficiency Wage Hypothesis is actually useful or empirically supported. Something tells me /u/besttrousers would know more than me. 

>Making college cheaper is not retarded, it would do absolutely nothing negative for the economy.

Considering the fact that college students are not cost-constrained, and that the American economy currently has a problem with [over-education](http://www.unc.edu/~joubertc/Draft0913.pdf), yeah it's pretty retarded. 

>Considering the amount of advanced economies that don't have tuition fees

As HE3 quite recently mentioned, countries that pull this off--like Germany--usually just flat out bar half the population from ever getting a degree. I really don't trust the US--or UK--political system to maintain such a level of discipline.

>but it still needs to be sorted out

Given that most of the discrepancy in earnings between men and women is down to lifestyle choices made by free individuals, there is absolutely nothing to sort out (well, not quite, making postnatal parental leave shareable is something which could be done). Claiming to want equality of opportunity and then using metrics for parity is ridiculous. 

EDIT: I unconsciously tailored this response to the poster, who is indeed a proponent of the 'discrimination' hypothesis of the wage gap. Sorry it was originally unclear, as he does indeed say in the image that it may not be the result of discrimination; nevertheless, if it isn't, I see no need for a 'solution'.

Of course, neoliberalism is tricky to either attack or defend, but specifically he is targeting low-wage jobs created in the global economy through trade, as implied in the image, so we'll stick to that.

Consider the [big picture:](https://fee.org/articles/were-seeing-massive-reductions-in-global-poverty/)

> Only since about 1970 has there been a rapid growth in the number of people living above the extreme poverty line and a drastic reduction in the number of people living under it. In 1970, about 60 percent of the 3.7 billion people living on this planet were still relegated to extreme poverty. Now, the figure is under 9 percent.

If the ""neoliberalism"" of the past half century was supposed to keep people in poverty, it's terrible at its job.  But as it is, there's in fact a strong [correlation](https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/ib/2001/110801.htm#ii) between liberalizing trade and this sharp decline in poverty:

> Opening up their economies to the global economy has been essential in enabling many developing countries to develop competitive advantages in the manufacture of certain products. In these countries, defined by the World Bank as the ""new globalizers,"" the number of people in absolute poverty declined by over 120 million (14 percent) between 1993 and 1998.

[And:](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/trade/publication/the-role-of-trade-in-ending-poverty)

> A dramatic increase in developing country participation in trade has coincided with an equally sharp decline in extreme poverty worldwide. Developing countries now constitute 48 percent of world trade, up from 33 percent in 2000, and the number of people living in extreme poverty has been cut in half since 1990, to just under one billion people. Trade has helped increase the number and quality of jobs in developing countries, stimulated economic growth, and driven productivity increases.

The evidence is pretty clear that trade helps the conditions of the poor by growing the economy.  Harvard economist Dani Rodrik [puts it plainly:](https://www.oecd.org/derec/unitedkingdom/40700982.pdf)

> Historically nothing has worked better than economic growth in enabling societies to improve the life chances of their members, including those at the very bottom.

And even while increased trade, openness, etc. are heralded as proven methods for growth, the paper points out that these aren't magic bullets that automatically right every wrong:

> The institutional context is perhaps the single most important factor in determining whether a given policy will be appropriate or not. 

The user might be interested to know that Rodrik also [criticizes](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/14/the-fatal-flaw-of-neoliberalism-its-bad-economics) the idea of neoliberalism, when it is taken to mean nothing but deregulation/less government.  We can allow nuance, despite the strong evidence favoring trade.

To get more specific, let's compare wage growth for women in the U.S. with women in India, where it appears the pictured women are working.  In the [U.S.:](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/real-u-s-wage-growth-led-by-women-over-last-four-decades)

> Weekly pay for women working full-time has increased almost 24 percent over the last four decades, compared with a 6.1 percent decline for men. 

Compare this with an article *lamenting* that wage growth in India has *only* doubled in *two* decades:

> Even though the GDP rose fourfold in 1993-2012, wages only doubled during the given period, the report said. The estimates by NSSO also hint that the real average daily wage has doubled between the period 1993—94 and 2011—12. For workers in rural areas, casual workers, female workers and low paid employees, wages have moved up faster during the period. However, huge disparities remain.

So women are improving at [faster rates than men in India:](https://www.firstpost.com/business/low-pay-wage-inequality-persist-in-india-despite-gdp-growth-women-earn-less-than-men-in-every-category-report-5053301.html)

> While women’s daily wages may have increased more rapidly than men’s between 1993-94 and 2011-12, female workers are still paid lower wages than men in each employment category, according to NSSO data.

As these articles make clear, we can lament the situation of women around the world, and the failures to fight inequality and discrimination, while also recognizing that the improvement of the globally poor women has increased at a much more rapid rate than either global men, or women in the U.S.  The data clearly contradict the comment's assertion that neoliberalism only helps the privileged, and does nothing for globally poor women - if we understand neoliberalism to represent the jobs and trade portrayed in the image.  

The evidence shows that in **absolute** terms women in poor countries lag behind other groups substantially, but in terms of **growth**, or as the comment says, ""difference in the conditions,"" global women outpace everyone, and trade (neoliberalism, if you will) is a big reason why.

The ironic core of this comment is that his own privilege is precisely why he fails to see that $1/hr could possibly be a good opportunity for these women.  

His privilege blinds him to the unsoundness of even his moral argument: if you paid workers more, you would have to hire fewer.  Let's say we pay each woman $15/hr.   Let's say even corporate leadership supports this idea.  But we are still in a moral dilemma: instead of paying one woman $15/hr, why shouldn't we instead hire 15 women and pay them $1/hr?  That $1/hr seems small to us, but it could mean the difference between living in the street, prostitution, a terrible arranged marriage, or any other much worse fate.  But no no no, let's not allow these women to decide to take a job - some guy across the ocean thinks the wages are too low, so those 14 women will have to remain jobless!  

The ""vulnerabilities"" faced by these women are precisely the lack of freedom they have in forging their own path in life.  Taking a job to support themselves - no matter how meagerly - provides that freedom, at least in part.

As [Krugman](https://slate.com/business/1997/03/in-praise-of-cheap-labor.html) puts it:

> The lofty moral tone of the opponents of globalization is possible only because they have chosen not to think their position through. While fat-cat capitalists might benefit from globalization, the biggest beneficiaries are, yes, Third World workers.

The moral message is clear - we should radically redistribute wealth to help those in need.  I agree.  But I get the impression that the socialists of today, or of any time, don't care so much about helping the poor as they do about sticking it to the rich.  I hope we can come around to helping the poor without lashing out at false enemies and the bogeyman of ""neoliberalism.""",lux514,t2_6uvmo,0.89,212,75

##Introduction

Before I begin, a special shoutout to u/besttrousers for pointing me to a [twitter thread of economists also R1ing Ben](https://twitter.com/besttrousers/status/1162016390309699590). I will be using it thoughout this R1.. As many of you know, Ben Shapiro is a neoconservative pundit who is quite active on Twitter as well as hosting the podcast “The Ben Shapiro Show” by The Daily Wire. Many young conservatives who listen to the likes of Jordan Peterson, Charlie Kirk, Steven Crowder, etc love Ben Shapiro and his *incredibly* nuanced takes on the world. 

##The Bad Economics

[A viral clip of Ben speaking about poor people circulated the tweet-o-sphere recently](https://twitter.com/JasonSCampbell/status/1161679740354387969). If you do not wish to listen to the entire clip here is it transcribed:

>	...Well, the fact is that, if you had to work more than one job to have a roof over you head or food on the table, you probably shouldn’t have taken the job that’s not paying you enough. That’d be a you problem. Also, it is not true that the vast majority of people in the United States are working two jobs, it just is not true. According to the Census statistics, “a small but steady number of American workers have more than one job, either because they need extra income, or because they want to gain more experience or explore different interests.” There’s a recently released US Census Bureau report, and apparently what it found is that approximately 8.3%, this is as of 2013, so it’s actually lower now, 8.3% of workers had more than one job. That was as of 2013, it’s a lot lower now. So this notion that there’s tons and tons of people who are working multiple jobs, it is not really true. It is not actually the reality. In May, 5% of American’s had multiple jobs, 5%. That’s really what is bringing down the unemployment rate, is those 5% of workers who work multiple jobs? For all of the talk about people working at Uber, it’s held to that range actually, really since 2009, it’s always been a very very low number, so this again is just a lie. It is also this bizarre idiocy that you dictate to the economy, what the economy ought to do. Every time everybody tries to dictate to the economy, what it ought to do, the economy fights back, because turns out, the aggregate knowledge of the market economy knows more than you do, I know, shocking.

There is quite a bit going on here, so I’m going to split it up and synthesize it into a few claims that I will then examine. 

##”That’d be a you problem”

What Ben is essentially claiming here is, if you are poor, or need more than one job to pay for necessary goods, that is your fault. What Ben is saying is that workers have incredible amounts of market power and should be able to either 1) select jobs that pay them a wage sufficient for this basket of necessary goods, or 2) demand wages sufficient for this basket of necessary goods. So, with such an outlandish claim, all that’s really necessary is for us to find cases where workers don’t have total market power, and maybe, we can find cases where *firms* actually have market power. 

First of all, let us consider a perfectly competitive labor market: wages are set by supply and demand and neither labor nor firms have wage setting power. If we relax that assumption and, say introduce labor market frictions i.e. there are no hitches or interruptions in the flow of labor from one job to the next, it is plausible that small wage cuts will not cause workers to leave a firm, therefore a firm gains market power in the labor markets and gain wage setting powers. This is monopsony power. Even if there is more than one firm hiring for the same job, firms can still have monopsony power (and yes we all know that mono means one. So, what frictions might there be in the labor market? As we know from [Stigler, 1961](https://home.uchicago.edu/~vlima/courses/econ200/spring01/stigler.pdf) search costs can create wide disparities in price (aka wages) between 2 goods. He then goes on to demonstrate that [lack of information causes employers to pay different wage rates or go through more costly search procedures (Stigler, 1962)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1829106.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Aaedfa79c2e92539e3daf1bdd7eeb74b7). Other frictions might be the result of labor immobility with Hseih and Moretti finding that [wages might be decreased by $1.27T annually](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/chang-tai.hsieh/research/growth.pdf). There is evidence that in some cases, [wages are below MPL, largely due to monopsony power](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26101.pdf). Our resident MinWage homie Dube also found [substantial separation and hiring elasticities in certain labor markets](https://escholarship.org/content/qt27z0006g/qt27z0006g.pdf) meaning that switching jobs just ain’t that easy. Unfortunately for Ben, there seems to be plenty of evidence that labor does *not* have overwhelming wage setting powers. 

Just as a quick aside, even Adam Smith believed that firms tended to have some power in labor markets (Wealth of Nations):

>	In the long-run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him; but the necessity is not so immediate. 

##How many people???

[For reference, this is the census data that Ben is referencing](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2019/demo/P70BR-163.pdf). He is correct, when he states that it is 8.3% of workers who are working multiple jobs. But then he goes on to say that it isn’t “tons and tons of people”. Doing some back of the napkin math all rounding down for convenience, in [December of 2013, there were 155M people in the labor force](http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/laus/us/usadj.htm). Rounding down again, 8% of that is a little more than 12M people. Now for some cheekier math. [The median age of the labor force is around 40 y/o](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/median-age-labor-force.htm), and [males in the US typically weigh more than 195lbs while females typically weigh 170lbs](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm). If we take 6M males x 195 + 6M females x 170lbs we get more than **2 billion** lbs of people or 1 million tons of people. I would say that this is tons and tons of people. Back on point, more than 12 million American workers working multiple jobs is not an insignificant number. It is roughly the population of NYC and LA combined.

To discuss the rest of the data, [the rest of this thread](https://twitter.com/inclusionist/status/1161731950455005185?s=20
) does a very good job explaining that, Ben’s numbers illustrating a decline come from a completely different sample source, as well as that survey undercounting multiple job withholding. 

Sidenote, I find it interesting that he opted for the Census data, rather than the Fed data, which would have served to [strengthen his point more](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=oEv0) and show a trend. But alas, we know that Ben isn’t super well known for his statistical rigor. Or any rigor for that matter. 
___
In sum, Ben’s comments really generated a lot of outrage amongst politicians, economists, and the public alike. Largely because he insinuated that the poor are poor due to their own machinations. Logically this is so strange anyways. “People have power in labor markets to set their own wages, but they choose to be poor”, is the strangest way to assign blame to poor people for being poor. Economically, this argument has no proof, and has plenty of proof going the opposite direction.

PS: I am a poor undergrad writing his first R1, plz be nice to me. 

Edit to address some common comments: 

> You are missing Ben's point, he is really telling people to acquire marketable skills

No he isn't. It is quicker and more economically correct to say ""The best way to earn more money is to try and gain marketable skills"". Plus, I have heard him say things like this. I have been listening to his podcast for a while and when he has straight up told people to get STEM degrees and other marketable degrees word for word. This is a completely different tone and word choice from him. 

> People should move, or do XYZ to earn more money.

This isn't a bad idea in a perfectly competitive labor market, but moving or XYZ doesn't solve the problem of monopsony power

> Muh supply and demand...muh free markets

475,5ecr81,2016-11-22,badeconomics,AMC price discriminates.,"OP has kind of stated the truth here, but I think he means that it will be bad for AMC to raise prices, which is bad econ. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/5dz2z8/after_amc_announced_tickets_to_blockbuster_movies/

OP states that AMC will charge more for better movies and this will cause people to pirate them more. Taking this at face value, it is a true statement. Popular movies will more often be pirated because the marginal benefit of finding a pirated movie would increase as the movie becomes better/more popular. If price is increased more people will find it beneficial to pirate vs pay as well.

However, I think OP means that AMC should not charge more for popular movies because they will lose money because people will just pirate. There exists a price where this would be true. As the price of a movie P_m  get sufficiently high, nobody would be willing to buy it and only people who gained enough utility from watching the movie would invest the cost of pirating C_p. This RI will not be an econometric analysis of movie price elasticity, instead it will only prove that it will be profit maximizing for AMC to charge a higher price for a better product, given certain, easily met assumptions. 

**Monopoly situation**
Monopolies set revenue equal to marginal cost. The profit function for AMC is given by 𝜋=P_m(X_i-𝜇*P_m-σ*P_m*i). Where 𝜇 is the amount that consumers will stop watching any AMC movies at the margin and σ amount of people who chose to pirate at a given price. In this example we will set MC to zero but it would still hold if MC>0. X_g = the good movies and X_m = mediocre movies. i= the modifier on the amount increase people will pirate better movies where i=g,1 and g>1.

∂π/∂P_m=X_i-2µ*P_m-2σP_m*i=0

P_m=X_i/(2μ+2σi)

**Good movie:**
P_m=X_g/(2μ+2σg)

**Mediocre movie:**
P_m=X_m/(2μ+2σ)

Here is where the most controversial assumption comes into effect. Number of pirates = σ*P_m*i is a linear function such that number of people who will pirate a movie depends on that movie's price and the quality. Since better quality movies do better at the box office at the same price, the increase in piracy as i goes from 1 to g must be less than the increase in X_m to X_g. 

Since X_g>X_m and the increase in piracy for good movies is not enough to make them less profitable that mediocre movies, P_m must be greater for good movies. Therefore, a monopolist would be better off increasing the price a small amount for a good movie, despite the increased amount of piracy. 

**Competitiveive Market**

In this case, price=cost. We assume that directors/CGI artists etc that are good charge a higher price. Therefore, the cost of a good movie would be higher and firms would charge more.

**Analysis**

I highly doubt AMC want's more people to pirate their movies, but they will take an increase in piracy and still profit maximize at a higher price. ",kaiser_xc,t2_8gunm,0.79,14,4

[Imgur link in case that thread gets deleted](https://i.imgur.com/uZyQdLF.png).

There are an impressive number of things that are wrong in a tweet less than 100 characters long. For one thing, race is not the same thing as nationality. ""Native born American"" is not a synonym for ""white people."" Most minorities in this country are native born Americans! Looking at native born Americans tells you nothing about race. 

The relevant data points will come from the [Current Population Survey in table H-5](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-households.html): 

Race| Household Median Income in 2018
---|---
White | $66,943
White Non-Hispanic | $70,642
Black| $41,361

For black immigrants, we'll need to look at the American Community Survey. [Pew has some tables constructed from the ACS data](https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2020/08/20/facts-on-u-s-immigrants-previous-years-data/). In 2017 median household income for foreign-born Americans from Sub-Saharan Africa was $52,730. Note that this is even lower than the US-born statistic of $60,000 so even if you ignore the conflation of nationality and race, his claim is still just wrong for most African-born Americans. 

On the other hand, it is true that Nigerian born Americans are very successful (median household income of about $65,000 according to ACS, which is still less than white non-hispanic households), but this immigrant group is unusual because they disproportionately come here under family reunification programs. [Chikanda and Morris 20](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19376812.2020.1744455?journalCode=rafg20):

>There are significant differences in the class of entry of immigrants from different African
countries such as Nigeria and Somalia. **Among the Nigerian-born immigrants, the most popular
classes of entry between 1997 and 2017 were as immediate relatives of US citizens (133,372 or
56.7%), the diversity program (53,550 or 22.7%), and family-sponsored preferences (24,697 or
10.6%)** (Figure 3). On the contrary, the overwhelming majority of Somali-born immigrants entered
as refugees and asylees (96,150 or 85.2%) and immediate relatives of US relatives (12,549 or 11.1%).
Thus, **the overwhelming majority of Nigerian-born immigrants who have entered the US in the past
two decades have done so under programs that encourage family reunification** while Somali-born
immigrants have entered through various humanitarian programs. 

This has clear implications on economic assimilation. If you are related to a U.S. citizen you are far more likely to speak English, benefit from an established social network, and be able to resettle to high-productivity metropolitan areas of the country. The relative success of Nigerian Americans is not evidence of a lack of discrimination, rather it is the product of the kinds of Nigerians that are allowed to immigrate to this country. It's quite possible this group faces discrimination as well but we wouldn't see it in the data without more careful research approaches. 

Finally, reducing racism to a solely class-based lens is grossly myopic. Black Americans are victims of disproportionate [police brutality](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/if2w88/the_brutalist_housing_block_sticky_come_shoot_the/g2rt166/), over-incarceration, and [prison violence](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2013/10/24/shame-our-prisons-new-evidence/).

477,a7nem8,2018-12-19,badeconomics,Mike Lee and Zero Sum Games,"Very quick RI:

President Trump recently renominated Chai Feldblum, an Obama appointee, to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Senator Mike Lee is putting a hold on her nomination, citing her views on LGBT issues, and suggesting that presents a threat to religious liberty. You can read his editorial here: https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/02/14/trump-should-withdraw-nominee-would-oppose-religious-liberty/

Let's not go into the broader culture wars in BE. However, I have a specific issue with the op-ed. I don't think Senator Lee understands what ""zero sum"" means. He's simply using it as a scare quotes term.


> “The [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] has jurisdiction only over employment,” Feldblum told the Washington Blade in 2015. “But other federal agencies that enforce sex discrimination provisions often look to our interpretation for guidance in interpreting the laws they enforce.”

> And don’t think for a second that you, your family, and your neighbors will be left alone if Feldblum gets her way. Feldblum has described modern-day politics as a “zero-sum game,” where rights for LGBT Americans are secured only by curtailing the rights of religious Americans.

> …

> As the Supreme Court acknowledges, America’s tradition of religious freedom embraces all. Rather than a “zero-sum game” that pits Americans against each other, we should work to build an America where “all possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship,” as George Washington wrote in 1790.

Saying that there is a ""zero sum conflict"" between LGBT people and religious Americans has a specific meaning. It's not saying that people are necessarily pitted against each other - it means that when we make policies decisions - especially about conflicting liberties - we should recognize that moving the line one way or another may harm the other group.

This is very clear in the [source of the zero sum quote](https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&context=facpub), a 2006 law review article.

> Ensuring that LGBT people can live honestly and safely in all
aspects of their social lives requires that society set a baseline
of non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and
gender identity. If individual business owners, service
providers and employers could easily exempt themselves from
such laws by making credible claims that their belief liberty is
burdened by the law, LGBT people would remain constantly
vulnerable to surprise discrimination. If I am denied a job, an
apartment, a room at a hotel, a table at a restaurant or a
procedure by a doctor because I am a lesbian, that is a deep,
intense and tangible hurt. That hurt is not alleviated because I
might be able to go down the street and get a job, an
apartment, a hotel room, a restaurant table or a medical
procedure from someone else. The assault to my dignity and
my sense of safety in the world occurs when the initial denial
happens. That assault is not mitigated by the fact that others
might not treat me in the same way. 

> Thus, for all my sympathy for the evangelical Christian
couple who may wish to run a bed and breakfast from which
they can exclude unmarried, straight couples and all gay
couples, this is a point where I believe the ""zero-sum"" nature of
the game inevitably comes into play. And, in making the
decision in this zero-sum game, I am convinced society should
come down on the side of protecting the liberty of LGBT people.
Once individuals choose to enter the stream of economic
commerce by opening commercial establishments, I believe it is
legitimate to require that they play by certain rules. **If the government tolerated the private exclusionary policies of such
individuals in the commercial sector, such toleration would
necessarily come at the cost of gay people's sense of belonging
and safety in society.** Just as we do not tolerate private racial
beliefs that adversely affect African-Americans in the
commercial arena, even if such beliefs are based on religious
views, we should similarly not tolerate private beliefs about
sexual orientation and gender identity that adversely affect
LGBT people.

> **But that is not to say that we should not acknowledge
that this zero-sum game has resulted in a burden on some
individuals' belief liberty and that we not be forced to
articulate why such a burden is appropriate.** A government's
reasons for burdening liberty should be, as Professor Rebecca
Brown argues, ""accessible to all in a meaningful sense.""
Brown defines these as reasons that ""have some public and
secular component to them and [do] not rest entirely on
personal moral belief systems not universally shared."" While
I am not sure I would use Brown's formulation of a ""personal
moral belief system not universally shared,"" I do believe that
the reasons given by the State must ""reflect the public good. ""
And ensuring that members of the public who have a morally
neutral characteristic are able to live without fear or
vulnerability of discrimination based on that characteristic
certainly seems to be a reason that reflects the public good. 

To take specific cases likely to come up to the EEOC: Should firms have the right to refuse to employ LGBT people? Or should LGBT people have the right to non-discrimination in employment? As far as I can tell, this is a zero sum game - bargaining over where the line should be drawn.

478,o4orjq,2021-06-21,badeconomics,R1: Increasing the number of unsolicited d*** pics DOES NOT decrease the cost of d***.,"I will be shocked if the mods allow this to stay up, even though I censored everything, so here we go:

**Overview of the Tweet**

I found this [tweet](https://twitter.com/milfweeed/status/1406003917306044421) from MILFWEEED, who stated the following:

>Fellas when you send unsolicited d\*\*\* pics you're driving the cost of d\*\*\* down. In a capitalistic market you're providing too much d\*\*\* to the consumers and they don't want it. we need d\*\*\* SCARCITY to create d\*\*\* DEMAND

There are several issues with this statement. Given that she says ""capitalistic market"", I am going to assume she meant perfect competition for the first part of this R1.

First:

>Fellas when you send unsolicited d\*\*\* pics you're driving the cost of d\*\*\* down.

If we are to assume perfect competition, increasing the supply of d\*\*\* pics would lead to a **decrease** in the **market price** of d\*\*\* pics, not a decrease to the cost of d\*\*\*s in general. ~~I would generally assume that the production of d\*\*\*s to be costless anyways.~~ The supply of d\*\*\*s is fixed and the production of additional units would be quite costly. @Katholikos points out that it takes 9 months to create a d\*\*\* and >50% of the time a d\*\*\* is not produced. Moreover, if we are to follow the law, then it will take another 18 years for the d\*\*\* to be matured enough for pictures.

Second:

>In a capitalistic market you're providing too much d\*\*\* to the consumers and they don't want it.

Under perfect competition, the number of d\*\*\* pics affects the **market price**, not the value (or utility) received for the d\*\*\* pics.

Third:

>we need d\*\*\* SCARCITY to create d\*\*\* DEMAND

Scarcity of d\*\*\* pics would result in a reduction in supply, not an increase in demand.

As you would imagine, the comment section has [informative commentary](https://twitter.com/HeavenlyGrandpa/status/1406004213281329155).

However, there is one [comment](https://twitter.com/KevinL84/status/1406012226167885826) from KevinL84 that really catches my eye:

>OK but what if it's not like, the whole d\*\*\* at once? It's just a bit of it, that is left unread in the DM and it accrues interest and you just add a bit more if it over time? Like a d\*\*\* mutual fund?

Hmm, I am kind of lost for words. A d\*\*\* mutual fund would require a portfolio of many d\*\*\* pics or DM imboxes (or both?), so I guess that would work.  My main concern would be determining a firms incentive to pay interest on unread d\*\*\* pics in the DMs. Anyone who is an expert in this area is welcome to chime in.

**Theoretical Consideration**

The biggest problem with MILFWEEED's tweet is that she mischaracterizes the market of d\*\*\* pics. Hence, I constructed a model that better represents the way in which the **market value** of d\*\*\* pics is determined. For the sake of simplicity, I only created the model for heterosexual interactions. However, a similar model can be constructed for homosexual interactions.

Let M={m^(1),m^(2),...} and W={w^(1),w^(2),...} denote the set of all men and women, respectively. Furthermore, assume that the characteristics of individual t can be captured by the vector **c^(t)**.

Then, for each pair (m^(i),w^(j)), there exists

market supply: s^(i)(q|**c^(i)**,**c^(j)**,w^(j))

and

market demand: d^(j)(q|**c^(j)**,**c^(i)**,m^(i))

That is, there is an individual market for d\*\*\* pics for each possible combination of man (supplier) and woman (demander). The market supply, s^(i)(q|**c^(i)**,**c^(j)**,w^(j)), is determined to the man's ability to send the woman d\*\*\* pics, his relationship to her, and the production of the image. Perhaps, it is the case that the man does not have her phone number, so sending her d\*\*\* pics would be quite costly. Moreover, the social cost of sending d\*\*\* pics depends greatly depends on the man's relationship to the woman, her age, and his own characteristics, including his occupation (e.g. politician) and his endowment, so to speak. The woman's demand for d\*\*\* pics depends on the characteristics of the man, her relationship to the man, and her own characteristics. Clearly marital status of both agents status would affect the supply and demand of the market. Perhaps, a parameter can be added that factors in all of the d\*\*\* pics sent.

This model greatly from that of perfect competition, as the interpersonal relationship between the two individuals is far greater at influencing equilibrium allocations than the total number of d\*\*\* pics sent in the market. This model is also more accurate, as it allows for product differentiation and the ability of sellers to discriminate against discriminate buyers.

This R1 is about sensationalism and not understanding how different statistical figures can occur from similar, if not identical datasets because of different methodologies.*

Anyone who checks Yahoo News may have stumbled across this headline: [Women actually earn 49 cents for every man's dollar — why the gender pay gap is worse than it seems](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/women-actually-earn-49-cents-every-mans-dollar-gender-pay-gap-worse-seems-173207324.html)

How horrible! Now it's not 23%, but 51%? Oh dear.

So, I decided to track down the real study, and looking at the links led me to this:

[Still a Man's Labor Market: The Slowly Narrowing Gender Wage Gap](https://iwpr.org/publications/still-mans-labor-market/)

Accordingly, ""[t]he commonly used figure to describe the gender wage ratio—that a woman earns 80 cents for every dollar earned by a man—understates the pay inequality problem by leaving many women workers out of the picture."" This sounds interesting, but what matters is methodology. So, let's take a look at that.

""When measured by total earnings across the most recent 15 years for all workers who worked in at least one year, women workers’ earnings were 49 percent—less than half—of men’s earnings, a wage gap of 51 percent in 2015. Progress has slowed in the last 15 years relative to the preceding 30 years in the study.""

And here we have the crux of the issue. We're looking at total earnings. I'm not attacking the study, but people who misinterpret the meaning of this. Let's make a highly simplified example (thanks to /u/besttrousers).

Say there are two people, M and F. M is male. F is female. Assume they went to the same school, have the same qualifications, graduated the same year, face the same market, the ceteris paribus works. 

M earns 1 dollar his first year, 2 his second, 3, 4, then 5.

F earns 1 her first year, 2, 3, but drops out of the labor force in year 4 because of family leave, before returning in year 5, in which she earns 4.

How do we look at the gender wage gap here? Let's start with average wage per year worked. On average, M earned 15/5 = 3 dollars on average. F earned 10/4 = 2.5 dollars on average. This is a wage gap of ~17%.

However, let's look at the GWG differently. Let's take total earnings across each year and divide by total years in the sample. Now, while M still earns 3 dollars on average, F earns 10/5 = 2 dollars on average, a wage gap of ~33%.

This new study (which builds upon a former study) takes the latter approach: ""This commonly used annual figure, however, understates the problem, especially for women workers, since it leaves so many of them out of the picture. The authors’ 2004 report, which pioneered the analysis of the earnings gap over 15-year periods, found an earnings gap of 62 percent for all women compared with all men (of prime working age) in the period studied, meaning that women made just 38 percent of what men made (Rose and Hartmann 2004).""

Now obviously, things are more complicated in the study, and the IWPR link will let you see the full report for yourself. I'm not attacking the study's veracity or methodology - that's for real, trained economists. 

My problem is with the sensationalized, clickbaity headlines that have come out from this study (Marketwatch, CBS, Vox, Yahoo, etc.) that imply that this counters the old 23% GWG figure. In reality, while it's possible some different data was used, leading to slightly different figures, the main takeaway is that a different methodology was used, leading to this gigantic difference.

*She is a woman, therefore may be woo’d. / She is a woman, therefore may be won.* (*Titus Andronicus*, Act II, Scene I, 82-83)

&nbsp;

People seem to have liked my first thread on bad economics in the RedPill community, so I’ve decided to make a second thread. Now I'm just an undergrad, so I apologize in advance if some of the economics in this post ends up being wrong. In this thread, we’re going to look at a post on /r/TheRedPill titled “The Role of Assumptions in the Red Pill Economy: Models for Intrinsic Valuation of the Wall.” This title might lead you to believe that the author will be discussing Game of Thrones, but unfortunately, this is not the case. For those lucky enough to have never encountered RedPill ideology in the wild, “the wall” refers to an age at which women’s “value” begins to decline. I have no idea how “value” is even defined, so I’ll assume it just refers to physical attractiveness and personality (subservience), both of which tend to decline as a woman gets older. I'd love to analyze the author's use of the word ""value"" in more detail, but I'll leave that to someone who's actually studied philosophy. Later on, we’ll also talk about “sexual market value,” (SMV), which is basically the price of a woman’s… services as if casual sex were a commodity which women supplied and men demanded. 

&nbsp;

Now that the jargon’s out of the way, let’s take a look at the actual post. Are you ready? Well, you better be, because the Bad Economics^TM starts just one word in:  

> **Abstract**

I was perplexed when I first read this heading because it didn’t make any sense. But moments later it dawned on me: this dude is structuring his post as if it were an academic paper, which may be the most pretentious thing I’ve ever seen on reddit. I didn’t include the text of the abstract here because it’s completely incoherent, but if you want to read it, be my guest.

&nbsp;

The introduction is just barely readable. The author writes:

> The Wall is the age at which the returns to scale or the marginal product of a females SMV starts to decrease.

I actually laughed when I first read this. While I still don’t really know what the author meant even after rereading this sentence multiple times, we don’t even need to know what he meant to realize that this is bad economics. First, the author uses the term “returns to scale” in a completely inappropriate context. “Returns to scale” refers to the effect of increasing inputs on the amount of output produced. The author then talks about “the marginal product of a female’s SMV.” This makes no sense. “Marginal product” refers to the additional output produced by adding one unit of some input. How can a woman’s sexual market value have a marginal product if sexual market value is analogous to a market price rather than to an input? Furthermore, I have no idea how “returns to scale” is synonymous with “the marginal product of a female’s SMV,” or why these things supposedly decrease after a certain age. Since this is /r/TheRedPill, maybe the author is an *ephebophile.*

&nbsp;

 The author then explains what he’s going to do in this “paper” 

> With examples, a framework for an Intrinsic Valuation of the wall will be given

According to Investopedia, “Intrinsic valuation” is a term that refers to the “true” value of a company or asset, as opposed to its price on the market. How does ""the wall"" have intrinsic value? I don’t know. I think what the author means to say is that he’s going to provide a framework for determining at what age the wall occurs, but since he's attempting to copy academic writing, he had to make his prose as opaque as possible. 

&nbsp;

The author then goes on to talk about “assumptions in the red pill economy,” and the age-old question of whether or not it’s important for economic models to be based on realistic assumptions.  I don’t really have much to criticize about this section, but I’ll include it anyway, because it’s hilarious how the author tries to imitate the style and formatting of real academic literature.  

> Whilst economist Milton Friedman(1953) pointed out the necessity for 'significant theories' to be proven by ‘unrealistic assumptions’, Alan Musgrave (1981) pointed the necessity to class assumptions (domain, negligibility, heuristic - see reading list) to achieve accuracy in testing economic models.

As far as I know, Friedman's point was that the thing that matters most about a model is not the realism of its assumptions, but how closely its results match reality. So according to Friedman, it's okay for a model to have some unrealistic assumptions. I haven't read Musgrave's work, so I don't really know what the author means by ""[classing] assumptions or why this is necessary ""to achieve accuracy in testing economic models.""

&nbsp;

Next, the author begins building his “model.” 

> To arrive at the age 30, several variables subject to their influence in your location are included in the valuation.
The valuation for the market that I operate in takes into account these variables that form assumptions for my Red Pill economy.

So apparently a woman reaches “the wall” when she turns 30 years old. I have no idea how the author arrives at this age. Even though the whole point of this model is to calculate the age at which women hit the wall, there’s no math to be found in the entire post. The author then goes on to list the variables which determine the location of the wall. 

> i) Physical Appeal - aesthetics and fitness.
ii) Market Mean age of marrying. - at what age are participants expected to be married if at all.
iii) Career emphasis. - Is a career emphasized?
iv) Viability of living an independent life. - nightlife etc
v) Education involvement. - Do participants enroll in higher/tertiary education.
vi) Traditional influence on lifestyle and outlook on life. religion etc

Umm, okay, I suppose? The author’s explanations of each variable are so sparse that we’ll just have to guess how they affect the location of the wall. 

> An Intrinsic market value may be derived from these variables.

What a cop out. This is on the same level as “the proof is left as an exercise for the reader.” I guess the author wanted to imitate the bad parts of academic writing as well as the good. Unfortunately, he only succeeded at one of those things.

&nbsp;

Next, the author discusses the implications of his “model,” which he seems to have just pulled out of his ass. 

> The intrinsic valuation for the wall given my constraints and assumptions is 26. At this age diminishing returns to scale take place.

What constraints? Is this supposed to be some kind of optimization problem? Who's maximizing or minimizing what, exactly? And again, the author misuses the term “returns to scale.”  

> Though girls physically are still appealing at 26, the demand significantly decreases due to upward pressure from girls aged 20-23 vying for the attention of suitable suitors aged, 27-33. The upward pressure is a result of low education involvement due to tradition, an environment that’s not conducive for an independent life, low nightlife appeal, environment where women are not career driven thus lowering the age at which to find a suitable long term partner.

I was left with so many questions after reading this paragraph. How does this “upward pressure” work? How does “low education involvement” push the wall up, and how is this a result of things like tradition, nightlife, and career ambitions? This is why math is useful in economics; had the author tried to formally model what he's saying here, he would have been forced to confront the fact that what he's saying makes no sense, and I would have been able to figure out what point he's trying to make.

&nbsp;

Next, the author talks about “market dynamics.” Keep in mind that he hasn’t specified at all who the actors are in this market or what the price signifies. 

>1. Marriage is still viable in my economy due to unchanged traditional perceptions.
2.	Women aged 26 onwards without a solid partner in life are treated with considerable caution especially in the absence of tertiary educational involvement.
3.	Unaware men (Beta) are often caught by this age group. 27 is the most common age for ‘mistaken pregnancy’. Coincidence or market mechanics (the wall)? You decide.
4.	Men who choose to be naive and don’t take the time and competency to study their market, end up divorced (Division of Assets) by age 36-38.

Okay, so apparently marriage is still practiced in part because of historical inertia, and people are wary of older women who are single. But why are “unaware men (beta)” so often caught by this age group? 

> Coincidence or market mechanics (the wall)? You decide.

i.e. “I have no evidence with which to back up my assertions, so I’ll frame it as a question to avoid having to make an actual argument.”

&nbsp;

Now we get to the last section, called “Hypothetical Implications: Like Banks, they get Bailed Out.” After rambling for a solid two paragraphs, the author compares a man paying alimony to his former spouse to a government bailing out a bank:

> The implications stay with the man as he will continually pay for his incompetency (alimony). In a nutshell, Incompetent men create winners out of potential losers - Bailout packages.

How on earth is alimony at all similar to a bailout package? The bank bailouts during the 2008 Financial Crisis were to prevent certain important financial institutions from failing and destabilizing the economy. In the bailouts, the federal government bought toxic assets from these financial institutions in order to keep them solvent. I think what the author's trying to say is that alimony rewards a woman for behaving badly, similar to how a bank bailout can be construed as rewarding a bank's bad behavior, and incentivizing further bad behavior. I also love how the author just takes it for granted that the woman is totally at fault for the divorce. Blaming other people for everything is Alpha, I guess.

&nbsp;

Finally, we get to the conclusion, in which the author goes completely overboard with cryptic, irrelevant aphorisms such as 

> Absolute freedom without responsibility is an illusion. Freedom to some degree can be attained by those who are competent and alert. To expect freedom by default, is a disastrous (heuristic) assumption on its own.

What does all this even mean? Your guess is as good as mine. It seems the author was more concerned with making his post sound like some grand 18th century political treatise than with actually making sense, a problem common to alt-right diatribes.

&nbsp;

So there you have it: another example of terrible economics from /r/TheRedPill. In the end, this is a perfect example of what Richard Feynman dubbed [""Cargo cult science,""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science) which refers to practices which assume all the trappings of real science while containing none of the rigor that makes scientific inquiry such a powerful tool. Instead of creating ideology which fits models, the author creates models to fit his ideology, and is therefore blind to the flaws in that ideology. In the immortal words of William Shakespeare:

&nbsp;

*""There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, / Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.""* (*Hamlet*, Act I, Scene V, 165-167).

Fruit so low it is rotting on the floor. Not necessarily because the idea itself is bad (microfinance works sometimes, and sometimes it doesn't) but because the presentation and content is utter garbage.

I'm not sure if this reflects poorly on the World Economic Forum or Bain and Co/Google, but nonetheless.

R1:
This article is almost incomprehensible in the way information was put together. It was very difficult to follow or read, which was frustrating because there was so little actual content.

>Encouraging female entrepreneurship could employ 170 million people by 2030. Other benefits include social outcomes and gender-sensitive innovations. Currently just 17% of female-owned enterprises employ hired staff.

First of all, a bold claim, followed by meaningless jargon and generalization: ""gender-sensitive innovations""? ""Social outcomes""? Followed then by a statistic that has nothing really to do with the earlier two sentences except by connotation to an unsupported and possibly incorrect conclusion (even when based solely on the evidence presented).

Then, without any evidence, the claim that encouraging entrepreneurship will increase employment is mentioned twice more with no supporting evidence other than a graph showing the ""potential impact"" of an ""increase in women-owned  enterprises"", i.e., a graph that says this is how many people these business _might_ employ.

They then move on to other advantages from ""increased  participation of women in entrepreneurship"" again with no references other than an assumedly equally terrible Bain and Co./Google Report. Then they get to what I can only assume is the supporting evidence section: 

>India has between 13 million and 16 million micro-, small- and medium-scale enterprises and agribusinesses owned by women, the Bain & Company-Google report stated.

>Notably, most of these women-owned ventures are single-person businesses, which translates to lower returns and employment. Only 17% of all woman-owned enterprises employ hired workers in comparison with 28% for all enterprises, the report said.

>Rural, non-farm, home-based businesses form the largest share (38%) of woman-led ventures in India. Urban, self-employed women who work from home constitute 31% of woman entrepreneurs, as per the report.

>“Farm-based business owners at 18% and small business owners at 14% employing less than 10 employees contribute most to employment generation,” the report said.

If you're struggling to understand what half of these numbers are doing here, you're not alone. But that aside likely what is being suggested here is that female entrepreneurs don't employ many people, and if they were to grow and hire people, then they would since other businesses that are larger _also employ workers_(more holy Grail causality). Incredible. To out more sensible words in their mouth, this is essentially a piece pushing microfinance and the idea that this is the way forward in India. This is despite the now old evidence that microfinance is most definitely not a one-size-fits all solution. (Just see Banerjee 2014, a seminal paper from 6 years ago, or any of the excellent papers by Woodruff). Anyone who has spent time with basic development economics knows to touch microfinance with a ten foot pole and a mini swimming pool of caveats. Yes it works in Bangladesh, but that doesn't mean it will everywhere else and for everyone. Often, these small businesses aren't businesses that can or even want to grow. They sometimes exist only because the people who own them have no way of working in labour markets due to gender norms (obviously important in this context). To be fair microfinance sometimes is helpful, I'm not R1 ing microfinance. I'm R1ing the application of it to draw such lofty and misleading conclusions. Arguably, a good amount of money has been poorly placed in programs that will do very little for anyone other than the entrepreneurs themselves (which is good but not the point of the programs).

Even beyond that, the evidence presented actually works against the very argument stated. If female businesses tend to employ less people than other businesses (on average) then why on Earth do you think they are a good candidate to boost employment? _Why not the businesses that actually do employ more people_?

Even beyond _that_, the external validity of these conclusions are ridiculous and it doesn't take much to start seeing holes. Clearly if these businesses grow, then they will compete and some will drop out. You can't simultaneously have every small business owner grow and employ more people without more competition taking place, and some firms being forced to exit. Sure if you also have a massive boost to demand then maybe, but there's no evidence to expect that.

To claim to be a font of Economic wisdom and produce such content warrants explanation.

Some background on WEF (scroll up for actual article and R1). This is hardly the only article guilty of this.
I followed this group on Facebook since I was trying to put more ""econ news"" in my feed. Turns out little of what they put out at least on FB is news, and very little has anything to do with Economics. I hear they also host Davos, but honestly I'm not quite sure what they actually do.

Here can you read about lady Gaga concerts and Bill Gates's philanthropy alongside Joseph Stiglitz's take on Coronavirus.

Based on the content they put out, it feels like what a 1st year undergrad econ student thinks Economics is: Something that can help you predict the future, a guide to improving your personal finances and something that tells people how they should behave. As most people learn Economics is none of those things (most of the time).

Usually they put out some semi-egregious content like Business Insider type content, or some shocking commentary: 'this just in, coronavirus will put at-risk people more at-risk'. But now with things going a bit crazier they have shoved out insane amounts of content, sometimes posting two articles every half hour. Most pseudo-scientific r/upliftingnews clickbait type stuff, very occasionally content from actual economics experts. 99% of their posts are either empty clickbait or have nothing to do with economics (often reposted several times over the weeks).

The articles are often completely meaningless and devoid of any insight and therefore mistakes. Often after clicking on an article that sounds interesting you become confused as if there is a mistake, when you find that what you're reading has nothing to do with the headline. Just completely unactionable and meaningless content. But there are some slip-ups. A few gems like this pop up though, showing that there isn't too much thought out into what they post when they do talk about economics.

The thing that drives me nuts is that this group, whatever it is, pretends to ""represent"" Economics and some people are fooled by this. They can't even reference properly most of the time.",gyg7,t2_50jk3l,0.85,56,27

Edit: [tl;dr](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/83ll72/raskhistorians_and_the_masculine_provider_fantasy/dvirs0d/) via /u/gorbachev

I normally love the content in /r/AskHistorians but this is an RI of the question being posed itself, the top /r/AskHistorians response, and also a bit of a broader RI on the *1950s American golden age* trope, “If we could only return to the 1950s, then we could …” 


It begins: **[Is it true that in the 50's the average man could provide for his family by himself? (In contrast to now, where both man and woman seem to need to work to provide for the family)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/83dbrg/is_it_true_that_in_the_50s_the_average_man_could/)**

The “back when the MAN could PROVIDE for the whole family by his-self with his BARE HANDS” (said loudly and with a drawl) arguments immediately misrepresent and trivialize women’s role in the home. Every (undeleted) comment in that thread misses this. I'm calling it the **Masculine Provider Fantasy** and think it contributes to a lot of badeconomics and unhealthy societal expectations (""men should provide for women as they are too frail and weak and stupid to have agency""). 

I just want to make this very clear: housewives in the 1950s *were not* lounging around relaxing all day being *provided for*; women were heavily involved in *domestic production* (the kind that is not measured in GDP because they’re not transactional activities).
 
Think of any photo of a poor African village - the women carrying large containers in their hands and on their head 5km each way for fresh water are engaged in labor-intensive domestic production all day long; are they *being provided for*? (Bonus question: if given the choice would any of those poor village women prefer to be an accountant in an air-conditioned office? Would she then contribute some of her new salary to buying a better home for her children? Congratulations – that’s what happened in the US!) The development of capital for the household like the washing machine, refrigeration, pre-prepared foods and other household appliances allowed women the extra time to leave the home to work outside of it rather than being cloistered to the kitchen. 

In other words before the 1950s in the US it was *necessary* to have one person constantly engaged in domestic production – those people were generally women. (I've heard someone phrase it like this: all technology died tomorrow, you or your significant other would probably have to quit in order to do those domestic tasks: haul water, wash clothes by hand, pluck chickens, prepare food, etc. Who would quit? Probably whoever made the lower salary yeah? Did men or women make higher salaries in the 1950s?) 

**Women were always providing for the family**, but because it was domestic production it was not counted by official statistics (“if you marry your maid, GDP falls”) and those women didn’t get a paycheck. Changes in domestic technology allowed women to pursue paid work opportunities outside of the home - providing income for the family instead of services.

Now on to the **[top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/83dbrg/is_it_true_that_in_the_50s_the_average_man_could/dvhpjoa/)** 

>**Employment Changes**

> In other words, in the 1950s it is fair to say there was a lot more labor participation for men than there is today— 

Yes 

>only 2 in 100 men that were seeking employment would not have found it, compared to 12 in 100 today. 

No

This isn’t what labor force participation means! OP is defining unemployment! The labor force participation rate is calculated as the labor force divided by the total working-age population. OP tries to correct this in a follow-up: 

>>> Yes, it is different from the unemployment rate. However, both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate only includes those who are actively seeking work, because the definition of the ""labor force"" is only people who are actively seeking work.

But Op thinks labor force is the denominator of LFPR (as in unemployment) rather than the numerator. Whoops! 
The [source cited](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160620_cea_primeage_male_lfp.pdf) even gives us the correct version on page 6, which OP misses:

>> The share of men between the ages of 25 and 54 either working or actively seeking work, also known as the prime-age male labor force participation rate, has been falling for more than 60 years and today stands at 88 percent.

OP claims 12% of men 25-54 seeking work today can’t find work - that is wrong 12% of men 25-54 are not working or seeking work. This report further gives: 

>> As shown in Figure 12, the share of nonparticipating prime-age men reporting they want a job has fallen over time, from a peak of 28 percent in 1985 to 16 percent in 2015. This suggests that at least a portion of the *increase in nonparticipation stems from men deciding that they do not want to work*, at least in the jobs available to them. 

OP's premise is conflating labor force participation and unemployment. 

> This leads us to the first and most compelling point about why single-family incomes in America seemed to work so well: for basically any prime age male in America, in 1950, if you wanted work you could find it.

>>[ **Recap**] Primarily in the form of near-guaranteed-employment

Unemployment in the 1950s ranged from 3%-8%; [unemployment today stands at the same rate it did in 1950](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE ). I don't see a sizeable difference from today other than men now choosing to work less or SBTC, but those who want to work seem to be able to find work.  

And for any prime age woman in the 1950s, well tough shit – those clothes aren’t going to wash themselves! 


>**Purchasing Power Changes**

> saw each year giving them more income, greater buying power, and a rising standard of living. By comparison, real median wage has stagnated in purchasing power from 1980–2010. (Current Population Report, Census) A natural side effect of this, along with household consumption continuing to rise, led to greater pressure on households to diversify into two-income.

It’s a good thing people are paid *compensation* which is wages *and benefits*. [Real Compensation per hour](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/COMPRNFB) has been rising. 

[Real Median family income](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEFAINUSA672N) has been rising  

[Real Median household income](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N) has been rising 

For support the author links to [these slides]( https://web.stanford.edu/class/polisci120a/immigration/Median%20Household%20Income.pdf) which cut off the last 25 years of data for some unexplained reason. (Also plotting the nominal and real on the same chart is bad form as it compresses the real data.) Despite this data being easily accessible, why the author doesn’t use data more current than 1990 is a mystery. Looking at [recent data]( https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEFAINUSA672N) we can note relative to 1953 real median family income in 2016 is more than double. 

Also I'll make an obligatory reference to [Where Has All the Income Gone](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/where-has-all-the-income-gone) 

>“[…] the findings in this article are consistent with recent research showing that the largest income increases occurred at the top end of the income distribution. However, **the findings here are not consistent with the view that the incomes of middle American households stagnated over the past 30 years. Income for most middle American households increased substantially.**”

So I don't buy OP's claim that dual earners families are from stagnant wages in the 1980s, as compensation is clearly increasing over that whole time period. Onto the next one: 

>**Women Entering the Workforce**

> Of difficult-to-quantify effects, we also have women entering the workforce over this time period, which in theory would increase total employable pools and put downward pressure on wages for labor.

Zero-sum lump of labor thinking; those women no longer have to beg their husbands to buy goods and services for them, those women are now directly buying things they want themselves with their own money. Again, if you have some village woman who no longer needs to spend 4 hours a day trekking for water because her home now has plumbing, and she spends those 4 hours working for an income – there’s both more production (S) and more spending (D). When the supply of labor exogenously increases, labor demand increases also so more women working will have an ambiguous effect on wages. Similarly, as we've already seen the total compensation throughout this period was rising! (Interesting thought: do women and men have different compensation preferences? Do women prefer a larger percentage of compensation to be paid as benefits?)  

>**Sentimental and Inaccurate Media Depictions of Post-War America**

I actually like this section. Thankfully OP explores that minorities might have better lives today than you know before the Civil Rights Act. 

>This put greater pressure on wives to have earning power in poorer households.

I wonder as women entered the workforce, to what extent were the new entrants in professional occupations from wealthier or higher income families. Into professional occupations I'd expect middle class backgrounds (the family owns the requisite capital to lower domestic production). This would be hard to test since opportunities for a professional occupation and household amenities are endogenous to family income. 

>**Recap**

>To summarize: although it may be an exaggeration to say ""the average 1950s man could provide for his family by himself""

I'd rather just say it's wrong. 

>Primarily in the form of near-guaranteed-employment, and higher and continual growth in buying power for labor, **median single-family households probably ""felt"" better off in 1950 and 1960 than they do today.** 

Maybe some white men 'felt' better off, but I highly doubt it would even be a majority of them. 

We've shown above that compensation and incomes are higher, obviously opportunity is higher, technological progress in consumer goods kind of speaks for itself, but let's look at some other realities of 1950 that aren't directly comparable^1 today (via U.S. Census Bureau's *Current Housing Reports Series* and *Census of Population and Housing*): 

* size of houses in the 1950s compared to the average house size today in square footage, number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms

* fall of the household size from ~3.5 to ~2.5

* rise of single occupant and single parent households (these change the composition of the 'average' household)

* the availability of complete indoor plumbing; in 1940 approximately half of US homes lacked hot piped water, bathing facilities, or toilet

* coal heating (50% of homes in 1940), wood heating (25% of homes in 1940), coke heating , fuel oil heating have all moved almost entirely to electrical/natural gas^2 today (next time you're in a developing country, watch for people cooking food with coal/coke stoves on the side of the road, then imagine that in your living room)

* air conditioning changing the habitability of the south and west

* life expectancy, infant mortality, educational opportunity and attainment, blah blah blah
 

---------------------------------------------------------------

Anyway what did happen in the 1950s? 

I follow [Robert Gordon's take:](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071W7JCKW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) from 1920-1970 the interstate highways, mass air travel, electronics and plastics, air conditioning, household appliances replacing housework, vaccination and antibiotics, birth control, university education, etc. were transformative technologies and we can see this in the high productivity of the time, growing 2.8% per year. Productivity increases opportunities, wages, etc. Since the 1970s technology advance has been arguably more marginal in nature: microwaves, cable tv, cell phones, etc., accordingly productivity growth has only been about 1.6% per year since then. 

Summarizing: productivity gave us domestic capital, this allowed women to move into the labor force and this was an unambiguously good thing; we shouldn't herald back to ""one man supporting a family"" as some golden age where the wages were high and the women worked at home for free.

485,hfrbhv,2020-06-25,badeconomics,Problems with problems with problems with causal estimates of the effects of race in the US police system,"Racial discrimination, given it's immense relevance in today's political discourse as well as it's longstanding role in the United States’ history, has been the subject of an immense amount of research in economics.

Questions like ""what is the causal effect of race on the probability of receiving a loan?"" and, with renewed fervor in recent years questions like ""what is the effect of race on things like police use of force, probability of being arrested, and conditional on being arrested, what's the probability of being prosecuted?"". This R1 is about [https://5harad.com/papers/post-treatment-bias.pdf](https://5harad.com/papers/post-treatment-bias.pdf) (Goel et al from now on), which is itself a rebuttal to [https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/jmummolo/files/klm.pdf](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/jmummolo/files/klm.pdf), (Mummolo et al) which is itself a rebuttal to papers like [https://scholar.harvard.edu/fryer/publications/empirical-analysis-racial-differences-police-use-force](https://scholar.harvard.edu/fryer/publications/empirical-analysis-racial-differences-police-use-force) (Freyer) which try to estimate the role of race in police use of force. 

Mummolo et al is making the argument that common causal estimates of the effect of race on police-related outcomes are biased. Fivethirtyeight does a good job outlining the case here [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-statistics-dont-capture-the-full-extent-of-the-systemic-bias-in-policing/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-statistics-dont-capture-the-full-extent-of-the-systemic-bias-in-policing/) but the basic idea is that if you believe that police are more likely to arrest minorities then your set of arrest records is a biased sample and will produce biased estimates of the effect of race on police-related outcomes.

The paper I am R1ing is about the question ""conditional on being arrested, what is the effect of race on the probability of being prosecuted?"" Goel et al use a set of covariates, including data from the police report and the arrestee’s race to try and get a causal estimate of the effect of race on the decision to prosecute. They claim that the problems outlined by Mummolo et al do not apply. They cite that in their sample, conditional on the details in the police report, White people who are arrested are prosecuted 51% of the time, while Black people are prosecuted 50% of the time. They use this to argue that there is a limited effect of race on prosecutorial decisions, conditional on the police report. The authors describe the experiment they are trying to approximate with their data as:

>""...one might imagine a hypothetical experiment in which explicit mentions of race in the incident report are altered (e.g., replacing “white” with “Black”). The causal effect is then, by definition, the difference in charging rates between those cases in which arrested individuals were randomly described (and hence may be perceived) as “Black” and those in which they were randomly described as “white.”

I'll explain soon why this experiment is not at all close to what they are measuring. Goel et al go on to argue why the ""conditional on the police report"" is sufficient to extract a causal estimate. They argue

>""In our recurring example, subset ignorability means that among arrested individuals, after conditioning on available covariates, race (as perceived by the prosecutor) is independent of the potential outcomes for the charging decision. Subset ignorability is thus just a restatement of the traditional ignorability assumption in causal inference, but where we have explicitly referenced the first-stage outcomes to accommodate a staged model of decision making. Indeed, almost all causal analyses implicitly rely on a version of subset ignorability, since researchers rarely make inferences about their full sample; for instance, it is standard in propensity score matching to subset to the common support of the treated and untreated units’ propensity scores.""

They then go on to create synthetic data where

>(i.e., Zi and Xi). Moreover, the charging potential outcomes (generated in Step 3) depend only on one’s criminal history, Xi, not on one’s realized race, Zi, and, consequently, Y (z, 1) ⊥ Z | X, M = 1. Thus by construction, our generative process satisfies subset ignorability.""

Naturally, their synthetic data support their conclusions. They run propensity score matching and recover similar estimates to their old papers.

There are two problems I have with their analysis is that the information available to the prosecutor is itself a possible product of bias. One is a more normative critique, implicitly, what Goel et al are saying is that while race may play a role in who is being arrested, it does not play a role in what is entered in the police report. I have a hard time believing this. If you accept, as Goel et al do, that race plays a factor in who gets arrested then it stands to reason that it also affects what is recorded in the police report. Beyond “objective facts” being misreported or lied about, there are also issues of subjectivity. If officers are more suspicious of minorities, and therefore arrest them at higher rates (as Geol et al allow for), then it is likely that they are also more suspicious when writing the police report. This is a normative critique, but it seems relevant. 

Edit: The more math-y critique is that they ignore the possibility of something affecting both the decision to arrest and the decision to prosecute. In effect, they ignore the possibility of conditioning on a confounder. Here I'm imagining something like a politician pressuring the district attorney and the officers to be tougher on crime. It affects both the decision to prosecute and the decision to arrest.  Maybe an officer doesn't write something on the police report, but tells the attorney. The authors might think this is a bad example and maybe they can convince me, but I take issue with them not acknowledging the possibility. 

Tldr; If you assume away all your problems then you no longer have any problems!

Classic [broken window fallacy](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/broken-window-fallacy.asp). The purpose of the military isn't to create jobs. It's for national defense, or conquest. If jobs were the end goal, you don't even need a military. Just pay people to stay at home and do nothing. That would actually be a more productive use of taxpayer dollars, because it would be much less expensive per ""job"" created, and it would free up an enormous amount of scarce resources to be used in other areas within the economy. 

Sure, the military creates a bunch of jobs. But in doing so, it removes that human capital from the labor market. This drives up the price of labor for entrepreneurs and business owners, which drives up prices for consumers. This also applies to other materials - oil, metals, R&D. Using those resources on military squanders them away from other more productive uses. The budget increase is going to be financed through federal deficit spending. That reduces consumer purchasing power. Every job that is created by the federal government is literally paid for by reducing the quality of life for every other US citizen.

Again, I'm not saying military has no value at all. But more ""JOBS, JOBS, JOBS"" is not a good thing. This is a president who ran on the campaign of ""draining the swamp"". Now he's cheer-leading more swamp. Wtf?

Edit 1:

Just gonna add some clarification since a lot of people are getting caught up here. 

My argument is that taking able-bodied labor out of the free market and squandering it on military is not a positive for the economy, it's a negative. The positive is what you get by doing that: national defense - and that's what the POTUS should be cheering about.

It's like when you buy food from the store. The lost money you had to spend on food hurts you. The food itself helps you. No one cheers about how much money they spent on groceries. You might cheer if you got the groceries at a discount.

There is an enormous amount of literature on this topic. [Here is my favorite resource that everyone should take the time to read](https://www.ibiblio.org/ml/libri/s/SmithA_WealthNations_p.pdf) - it's also available as a [free audio book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp-59DOIi88). And I'm happy to discuss more in the comments. I'm pretty happy with the active discussion and healthy debate!

Edit 2: 

I recently wrote a more in-depth explanation with more details that also addresses some of the other concerns that people have raised on this thread over the military's benefit to the economy (which is not the focus of this post).

https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/7wlzjy/donald_trump_getting_excited_because_increasing/duqi3r8/

Here's a snippet:

> Trump is bragging about creating jobs because he believes people are struggling to find work and he knows that employment rates are one of the ways that people measure the success of the economy. The fallacy here is that the jobs themselves aren't an intrinsic plus for the economy - they're an intrinsic cost. He's basically cheering about how much money he's spending (with the implication that he's fixing the economy) without measuring the actual benefit to the economy.

> Even if you wanted to look at the MB>MC effect of hiring additional military personnel, that does not imply the creation of more value for society as a whole - only for the military. Even if the military industrial complex has some short-term benefits to the economy, this completely ignores future hidden costs (like veteran benefits, instability created in conquered nations leading to terrorism, etc), and conveniently, economists who are pro-military never seem to look at society as a whole (including the foreign countries that are being invaded). Again, the long-term effects of blowing up other countries may include fewer options, higher prices, and less liberty for citizens and consumers. This isn't even the point of my post, but it's worth while to point out how shallow some of the comments in this thread are that are arguing that the military provides a net economic benefit.

This assumes a fair society. In reality, in the current capitalist model it would be more like:
Less jobs, maintain daily hours on existing jobs, blame those unemployed for being jobless, remove benefits, cull population by starvation.
https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/6jbq6e/glastonbury_food_vendors_uproar_after_jeremy/
There are several problems with this comment so let's break it down into smaller chunks for easier debunking.

1. Finance jobs are worthless
2. Redistribution of wealth will lead to shorter working hours on average
3. That in our current ""capitalist model"" there will be massive starvation of the unemployed.

Let's start with the claim that finance jobs are worthless, the first problem with that statement is that there is no objective way to determine a value which is needed for the statement worthless. The best attempt we have to create a system of value measurement the price system places a high value on finance jobs given that they pay high salaries
Studies have shown that the average financial worker contributes more to the economy in the UK than the average worker
http://www.cityam.com/263446/financial-and-professional-services-industry-contributes

To think about how finance workers contribute to the economy you must consider capital a scarce resource which has to be allocated in the most efficient manner. Finance allows it to be allocated in the most efficient manner by creating various option for its allocation via different type of financial instruments, HTF trading allows new information to be quickly factored into markets increasing the efficiency of the price market that forms the bed-rock of our current economy. Without them our ability to allocate capital towards certian goals,products and services would be severly hampered and it would most likley retard our economic growth signficatly

The next claim is that redistributing wealth will lead to shorter working hours for the average person, this isn't necessarily true as creating the administrative infrastructure to administer these benefits will obviously consume personnel and if done inefficiently could raise a number of hours worked. Behaviour economics is also a tricky subject even at the best of times as it combines the economic and physiology two notoriously soft sciences, It's quite possible that work-time could stay the same as people seek a higher standard of living

The third claim can be disproved by history as technology has rarely ever led to calls of the population because technology doesn't just destroy jobs. It also creates jobs such as how the number of jobs for bank workers increased at the same time as the ATM was introduced as it allowed far more bank branches to be opened

490,5ee29v,2016-11-23,badeconomics,Obamacare is a heat seeking missile that will destroy jobs: A Primer on Job Lock and the Dangers of Reasoning from a Quantity Change,"**Overview**


In this R1 I will be going over an example of reasoning from a quantity change and how that is flawed. It is flawed for the exact same reasons that reasoning from a price change is, because the important part is what is driving the price change (or quantity change).  We shall see that just because the Affordable Care Act looks like it reduced the amount of labor supplied, that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, due to an existing distortion causing too much labor supplied in the labor market (more on this later).  Finally, I will note that this R1 will not claim attempt to quantify the reduction of job lock due to Obamacare, merely note that this possibility must be accounted for. Finally, I make no claims that negative aspects of Obamacare do not outweigh these positive job lock effects. Feel free to continue opposing Obamacare if you want to. Just be aware of this argument for it

Furthermore, if you believe in job-lock, you will support either the removal of subsidies for employer provided health insurance or allowing all types of health insurance to be subsidized. Some Republican proposals do these things!

**The Claim**


>The director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who said during congressional testimony  that the bill would kill 800,000 full-time jobs in the first decade alone. Bottom Line: As Minnesota Congressmen John Kline puts it, “ to suggest [Obamacare] doesn’t undermine job creation is to deny reality.


See the framing? It’s going reduced jobs = bad. However, this is reasoning from a quantity change! It assumes that more jobs = good. We need to ask what is driving these changes to know if the decrease in jobs is a good thing or not.

____

**Theoretical Background**


Health insurance is often tied to employment because of the very large subsidies given to employers to purchase health insurance. Premiums from employer provided health insurance are tax exempt, allowing employers and employees to prefer it as a form of compensation just to dodge taxes (this is not efficient at all). 
This basically means that if an employer spends $1 on health insurance, it translates into $1 of benefit received by workers. Monetary compensation does not work like this, as both employers and employees will have to pay taxes (particularly if the employee is high income and therefore in a high tax bracket). So for direct compensation, it might take $1.50 of spending to give the employee $1 of take home pay. This is very distortionary, as composition of compensation is being determined by *tax policy* not worker’s preferences or the firm’s fundamentals of providing those benefits.


There could be other reasons (internalizing externalities from healthcare for example) but even if these are present, making health insurance subsidized is unlikely to be a good idea. For example, in the internalizing externality case, we don't need any government intervention. But I am getting ahead of myself. To better understand job-lock and it’s implications, it’s often a good idea to look at a situation where we *don’t* have job-lock. In which case, it will just be a compensating differential. Firms that offer health insurance can pay lower wages then firms that do not.


[Gruber and Madrian (2002)]( http://www.nber.org/papers/w8817.pdf) offer an example. This paper is also a good literature summary.



>In this example, health insurance coverage consists of a binary, homogeneous good; individuals are either covered or not, and if covered have the exact same insurance plans. Insurance is perfectly experience rated at the worker level. That is, firms essentially purchase insurance on a worker-by-worker basis and are charged a separate premium for each worker. Jobs that offer health insurance feature a negative compensating wage differential. Moreover, each individual job (worker-firm match) can have its own compensation structure; firms can offer insurance to some workers and not others, and can pay lower wages to those workers whose insurance costs more.


So basically


1.	There is one kind of insurance (akin to a homogenous good assumption)


2.	Firms know the *exact* insurance costs of an individual worker. (a perfect information assumption)


Therefore, if you are a worker in this case, you can choose between having a firm compensate you for health insurance or just having a higher wage. So you can receive $100 worth of health benefits or $100 in extra wage income. Furthermore, a firm can offer you health insurance on a purely individual level.  
By free entry, we will have firms pay workers the specific costs of insuring them any less and firms are having economic losses, anymore and they have economic profit.


So basically it becomes irrelevant if you have health insurance or not. It doesn’t increase or decrease your total compensation. As such, **it cannot affect any labor supply decisions you make**.


Let’s relax the assumption that insurance is homogenous across all firms. Let’s say larger firms can offer insurance at cheaper rates. This could be due to increased pools of individuals, fixed administration costs, or bigger firms are able to take advantage of the subsidies for employer provided health insurance (this one is especially important).  


If you are more productive at a small firm, but a larger firm can offer you more compensation *solely because they can offer cheaper insurance* we are seeing health insurance distort labor supply decisions. If we had perfect competition, the only way to increase your compensation would be to move to where you are most productive.  This is an example of job lock. This lock will allow the firm to earn some rents from the worker. If the firm tries to capture all of these rents, the worker will become indifferent between the two jobs. 


Gruber and Madrian note the following about this possibility


>There is a long literature on the incidence of health insurance costs which speaks to this question, and it is reviewed by others at this conference, as well as in Gruber (2000). That literature finds clear evidence that the costs of insurance are shifted to worker wages on average, at least in the medium to long run. And there is also evidence in Gruber (1994) and Sheiner (1999) cost shifting to broad demographic groups within the workplace, with relatively high cost groups (such as older workers or women of child-bearing age) receiving lower wages as a result. But there is no evidence to date that speaks to worker-specific shifting. In practice, full rent capture on a worker-by-worker basis seems unlikely, due to preference revelation and administrative difficulties. So long as pay discrimination by valuation of insurance doesn't occur on a person-by-person basis, there will be job lock.


Once you accept that job lock works to change the *types* of jobs and firms (substitution on the intensive margin or inside the labor force) you work at, it’s pretty easy to think about it also affecting retirement decisions (extensive margin or entering/exiting the labor force). This makes the employer provided subsidy very problematic. The subsidy allows employers to be able to purchase health insurance cheaper then workers. As such, they may choose to continue working and, in effect, buy insurance through their employer.  This is tricky to estimate, as staying working longer for more compensation (including health insurance) *isn’t* distortionary.  


----

**Application to Policy**

Finally, Obamacare sought to increase the availability of cheap private insurance and reduce pre-existing conditions. These actions could reduce job lock in several ways. First of all, individuals with pre-existing conditions would be more able to move between jobs (previously they had around 90 days or could get labeled with a condition, making employment much more difficult). Also, allowing private alternatives to employer provided health insurance will limit job lock as well, as it gives an alternative where employees do not simultaneously make health insurance purchasing decisions and labor supply decisions. 


Finally I’ll note that job-lock likely isn’t eliminated by Obamacare and that lots of the evidence for job-lock is using reduced form work that assumes no real differences between workers (looking at workers who abruptly lost coverage vs. workers who didn’t). I don’t think these are always perfectly exogenous but I think suggest that job-lock is a relevant. If you have any smoking guns, please post it.

As usual, I have a video I made for my Economics YouTube channel, and can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44qzWa9uUZA)

\-------------

We have 2 big aspects to the video. We have more stuff getting produced and consumed. And then we have growth. And we have waste. This is important and the connection will become more apparent as this video goes on. The goal of this R1 will be to show that you can’t have our economic growth without all of the goods and services and ‘consumerism’ that goes along with that.

>In the global North, overconsumption runs rampant. Whether it’s a brand new Tesla Model S or a nice pair of jeans, buying for status, acceptance, desire, or because of that Instagram ad are all ingrained in our conception of success and mental wellbeing. Under Capitalism, we buy the right things as a way for us to seek acceptance from, and connection with, our peers. The barrage of ads we encounter everyday equate smiles with Kaki’s, suaveness with sunglasses and even love with headphones. But this drive to purchase that new Swiffer wet jet or new car is not an inherently biological trait.

Aaaand we’re off to the races. Waste, consumerism, consumption and capitalism. Naturally the way capitalism is framed here is as a modern invention, and supposedly advertising is making us buy all of this stuff. It’s all modern woes that didn’t exist in the past. The implication is that all of this is a modern construction, that has created a modern problem. It’s all to do with the seeming imperative for infinite growth on a finite world. Therefore, according to the video,  that’s why degrowth must happen to save the planet. And yet how true is that historically?

A lot of claims are made here and there is a lot to unpack.

From the Great Divergence: China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy. Page 130, After 1400 there is a large increase of people using goods to define themselves, even as popular works decried this trend. Basically what was becoming a middle class was trying to emulate the rich by buying things only available to the rich previously, and then the rich shifted their consumption to other items of status that were out of reach of the emerging middle class (for a lack of a better term), but as the Industrial Revolution took off and further lowered prices, this cycle continued. “Large numbers of writers complained that these trends drained the wealth of society, bankrupted noble families, and undermined more important measures of status and human worth. Throughout Europe, governments and religious institutions tried, at least intermittently, to arrest these tendencies-but with little success. Increasingly, people defined themselves though the tireless accumulation of possessions.”

The author notes that is was the demand for goods that helped spur the Industrial Revolution and rapid output of goods, rather than the increased supply creating an increase in demand.

From the Mind and the Market: Capitalism in Western Thought. Page 57, we get the following cycle (in reference to the 1760s and 70s) “What had once been regarded as ‘luxuries’ came to be seen as mere ‘necessities’, what had been ‘decencies’ become ‘necessities’ and the very definition of ‘necessities’ changed. Objects once reserved for the rich now come into the reach of a larger part of society. ‘Goods once produced laboriously at home, such as clothes, beer, candles, cutlery, and furniture, could now be purchased instead. This part is important, as we get, ‘What was new was not the desire to consume, it was the ability to consume that was unprecedented, made possible by the increase in national wealth and the declining cost of goods.” Page 58

From he Enlightened Economy: An Economic History of Britain 1700-1850 page 15, “The consumer revolution, as it has been called, clearly preceded the Industrial Revolution and had been attributed to a growth in household earnings stimulated by the new and desirable goods that were coming on-line the Seventeenth century and which prompted people to work more to generate the cash that made them accessible"". It’s easy to take consumerism now for granted, but it certainly wasn’t in the past. Between 1820s and 1850’s, even as the Industrial Revolution spread into more industries and effected the lives of more people, consumption actually didn’t increase that much and during this period men and women were shorter and were not consuming as many calories as they had previously. So there were advancements and increases in production and increases in consumption (especially of the rise of the ‘middling sort’, roughly a middle class) from 1700 to 1820, and then this slowed down quite dramatically before picking up again after the 1850s.

Naturally capitalism here is not defined and the definition is assumed. We can assume he’s basically referring to capitalism as most of the bad stuff happening in the world to do with waste, consumption and marketing. But what about our overreliance on non-renewables?

**It’s worth looking at a theoretical paper on the subject.**

Source 4. Page 4. Source finds that long run growth can be sustained even if substitution between input materials and natural resources is less than unity (1). This holds if substitution of different resources is greater in the knowledge-using sector than the knowledge competing sector.

The way I read this (and I’m happy to be proven wrong)  is that if an industry uses 100 tonnes of an input but then has to substitute for another input but requires 110 tonnes for the same output, that can still lead to sustained long-run growth if this occurs in the knowledge using sector. And this is all done under market conditions using prices rather than mandates.

From the conclusion: “However, we have shown that with poor input substitution, the knowledge spillovers can only sustain growth if substitution in the sector for which innovation is developed is larger than in the sector without innovation opportunities. In this case, the increasing scarcity-price of resources makes the sector without innovation opportunities relatively expensive, shifting consumer demand towards the innovating sector and increasing the incentives for innovation.”

&#x200B;

>”Green growth doesn’t work” \[hence degrowth is required\] In addition to its impact on individuals self-conception and mental health, capitalist overproduction and subsequent overconsumption, especially in the global North, drives massive waste, emissions and pollution.

There is a ginormous, massive, irony at play here of course. Degrowth would lead to fewer consumer products and services, fewer related jobs, and eventually a lower population. Less technological innovation. So less R&D into innovation means less innovation and fewer things in the future. Imagine this. Degrowth had started in the 70s, 80s or the 90s. What if the internet hadn’t exploded in use and usefulness over this time? You almost certainly wouldn’t have YouTube for example, and you wouldn’t have this channel complaining about economic growth. Indeed, you would have this same person or team complaining about the *lack* of growth and lack of cool things to buy and experience.

According to the video, green growth doesn’t work supposedly. And neither does decoupling. And so the conclusion is that degrowth is the only solution.

Here is a source showing decoupling at work: [https://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/articles/21-countries-reducing-carbon-emissions-growing-gdp/](https://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/articles/21-countries-reducing-carbon-emissions-growing-gdp/)

**The above source notwithstanding, we do produce a lot of waste and a lot of plastic and we do need reductions in emissions**. How is that going? Let’s look at a series of graphs. [https://imgur.com/a/FBgPThG](https://imgur.com/a/FBgPThG)

Let’s look at the story here. Firstly, aggregate world plastics production and cumulative production make for a very sobering reality. Just these on their own would seem to back up the idea that we need degrowth and that consumerism is bad. It’s not hard to imagine that the trajectory is not sustainable.

Global per capita emissions have perhaps surprisingly dipped in the past, and recently it looks like they might be rising again. Of course being global, this masks a lot of regional variability and there could be some large countries pushing that up, whilst other countries are actually lowering per capita emissions.

When looking at per capita plastic waste vs GDP per capita, there is a general upward trend, with some notable poorer nations that are doing particularly poorly in this regard that really stand out. There are some countries that are standouts in the opposite direction. But there is a sense from this graph that there is a chance that a wealthy democratic nation can become wealthier without the corresponding rise in plastics waste.

We then see that the US has actually made great strides in lowering carbon emissions per unit of GDP since the 1990s. It’s still above the other large nations, but those nations have also seen non-insignificant declines over this period too (other than perhaps Switzerland). But we then see that the US, EU and Australia are bottom of the world when it comes to the share of plastic waste that isn’t adequately managed. This would once again point to a future that is more positive, where it’s possible to grow the economy and still manage plastic waste.

Production vs consumption-based CO2 emissions per capita for Europe, Australia and the US having been trending down for at least a decade now. Overall world carbon efficiency is improving, a positive sign.

World per capita CO2 emissions relatively flat in the past decade or so, which masks rising per capita emissions in India, Brazil and China. However, the US really stands out when it comes to GDP per capita vs energy use in tonnes of oil equivalent per capita. We then see a clear decoupling of the UK economy with regards to GDP and Co2 emissions. The US is heading in that direction.

And so as the US example at the end shows us, the story of CO2 pollution, plastics production and GDP per capita is quite a complicated one. Clearly the US has a lot more work to do in this regard and stood out in the series of graphs. However, even as bad as the aggregate numbers are, the per capita numbers for the majority for the developed world are looking very encouraging. And there is hope that new technology can further reduce per capita CO2 emissions and plastics waste. For poorer nations, there is hope that by utilising the latest technology, they too can begin to lower emissions while enjoying robust growth. I hope the evidence I have presented thus far, alongside the graphs has helped paint a more optimistic picture of pollution and growth, but more importantly, a more realistic one.

>…No second home on the individual level. But ultimately degrowth cannot function as just individual lifestyle choices, systemic pathways, like subsidising all housing retrofits…redistributing all food waste, dramatically expanding public transportation methods…and a robust emphasis on low carbon care oriented jobs like educators, therapists and homecare providers are just some of the many ways to simultaneously improve the wellbeing of all while drastically reducing the global North’s consumption levels.

Let's tackle these 1 by 1.

You might say people shouldn’t be allowed to invest their money into a second home for example. Okay…but then where should they invest their money instead? The vast majority of American’s wealth is in their home. Such a mandate would not solve issues with emissions and waste nor help us toward a greener, more technologically efficient future.

What about a carbon tax. Like an emissions trading scheme. How is that working out for Europe? You can see via the followings links, [one](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/16/8804), [two](https://energytransition.org/2020/11/the-eus-emissions-trading-scheme-is-finally-becoming-a-success-story/), [three](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WP106-effectiveness-eu-emissions-trading-system.pdf) and [four](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/understanding-european-unions-emissions-trading-system), that it's not bad actually, as per the below links. It would be great to see this system implemented in other markets around the world to see the effects in different contexts. There is of course a lot of work left to do in this regard.

There are organisations that already redistribute food that would have gone to waste in most cities around the world. No need for mandates here.

Regarding public transport, it should be noted that public transport only works in high density cities. If their dream of degrowth occurs, we won’t have our dense cities anymore, and hence no need for public transport.

And there you go, now they want to mandate what kind of jobs should exist. What gives the team behind this channel the right to decide what kind of jobs should exist? What gives them the right to have their current jobs? What if someone else said that the people behind this team have jobs that are helping ruin the environment (ie. Contributing to YouTube and consumerism in general), how would the team respond to that charge?

>Highest per-capita consumers could cut their consumption rate by 95% and still live well with a combination of efficiency technologies and alternative lifestyle choices.

You can’t make this stuff up. How and where are these technologies going to come from if not for more investment and the prospects for future growth?

The rest of the video goes off the rails, but he does describe worker cooperatives, which is something that already exists. That’s a big topic in itself, I have another video which goes into that topic.

**Conclusion**

There isn’t anything else worth responding to in the video, but that doesn’t mean that we don’t have a problem with production, growth and waste right now. It’s worth looking into the complicated stats behind material’s use between 1900 and 1990.

Source 2. Page 33 \[UI = Intensity of material use\] These stats were collected in 1996, and the results cover the period 1900 to 1990. The story of material use (absolute and per capita) is a complicated one. Metals and minerals actually saw declining per capita use even as absolute use increased from 1970 to 1996. Forest products see relatively flat per capita usage over this period, meanwhile nonrenewable organics saw increased per capita use over this period. “Rogich found an increase in the absolute consumption of materials from 142 million metric tons in 1900 to 2.5 billion metric tons in 1989”.

However, Rogich finds that per unit of GNP, overall materials IU declined from 1970 to 1990, a trend he attributed to the fact that “services are contributing a growing share to our GNP.”

Page “The IU (weight per dollar GNP) for plastic, aluminum, potash, and phosphorous increased from 1900 to 1990, whereas IU for timber, copper, steel, and lead declined. For the entire U.S. economy Wernick and colleagues (1996) found that IU as measured by weight per dollar GNP declined by one-third from 1970 to 1990.”

Also, the author cautions that the use of less material (on a per capita basis) doesn’t necessarily translate to better for the environment. He cites a few examples, using aluminium instead of steal is actually more damaging to the environment, substituting wood with plastic pose significant disposal and recycling issues. Lighter cars use less petrol, but steel is easy to recycle whereas the composite materials used in lighter cars are difficult to recycle. So fuel consumption goes down, but there may be an overall increase in waste produced and resources consumed.

Source 3. The paper focuses on investment of the steel industry in Poland. They found that increased investment by the steel companies typically led to more efficiency, decreasing resource intensity for steel production. This was a study done between 2004 and 2018.

From Animal Spirits How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Hwy It Matters for Global Capitalism, pages 116-130, the authors state that the standard theory that people balance saving with consumption is wrong, and that people make poor spending choices all the time and undersave. We can say they are overconsuming, and thus this will make it harder to retire in old age. And so Superannuation schemes like what we have in Australia are popular because they take the choice from people and force people to save more for their retirement, so they are not a burden on the economy. People are forced not to be consumers so they are less of a burden to the government in old age. That could be seen as mandating against one of the pitfalls of consumerism, especially given people’s propensity to buy things they don’t necessarily need.

Source 1. Clearly the growth in the production of stuff, whether goods or services matters to our economy. Page 13, As Broadberry (1998, p. 376) concludes, “both Germany and the United States overtook Britain in terms of aggregate labor productivity largely by shifting resources out of agriculture and by improving comparative labor productivity in services rather than by improving comparative labor productivity in manufacturing.”

The paper argues that growth came first, allowing workers to move out of agriculture and into other industries. It wasn’t a matter of tariffs allowing people to leave agriculture and then go into manufacturing to help produce more stuff, that sort of thing came first and that allowed people to leave the agricultural sector. But this growth was not possible without the rising consumer demands of the time.

Or how about The Brady Bunch? A normal American family with one man supporting all the kids. What a shame that average joes can’t live that life anymore.

Here's a link to the relevant post: https://np.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/15ghog1/the_american_dream_is_dead/

Marginally snarkier blog version available [here.](https://jackthoughts.substack.com/p/no-it-was-never-normal-for-one-person)

> I feel the need to explain something to the generation that does not remember, or never saw, a world where one person with a high school education could support a family of 5 comfortably.

R1: I don’t think 90% of the people reading this need it to be shown to them that this idea of American history is wrong, but apparently, thousands of people spending their time on Reddit think it's right, so let’s dive in. For the purposes of this post, I’m going to assume that “normal” means occurring at or close to the median for continuous variables like income, or in other cases where the variable in question is discontinuous, occurring for a plurality of Americans.

Incidentally, this idea of American life was directly contradicted in a paper I read for a class I took on poverty in America during my last semester of college. The relevant excerpt from [this paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/000271620157700102), written by historian Linda Gordon, says “there was never a time in U.S. history when the majority of men were able to support a wife and children single-handedly.” This statement cites three sources, but all of them were written pre-Great Depression, and usually, it’s the time spanning from 1945 to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 that people fawn over, so I’m going to look elsewhere for more information.

First, take a look at [the real median personal income in the US](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEPAINUSA672N), a measure of the income received by the middle American if you line everyone up in order of income, adjusted for changes in the average price level over time. This contradicts the narrative in the post: albeit with busts and booms, the “normal” American has been making more and more money since 1974, the earliest year recorded in the chart, adjusted for purchasing power. Even if there was a time when the typical American with a high school education could support a family of five with just their income and a handy housewife, that same American can now make even more money in the modern day…assuming they’re willing to (potentially) get a college degree, depending on the industry they go into. This chart doesn’t look exclusively at people with only a high school education, and I’m guessing you’ve heard about the [growing income gap between people with and without a college degree.](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/) It already seems doubtful that it's gotten harder for the typical American to pull off the lifestyle described in the linked post, but we're going to have to look elsewhere for data specifically on the earnings of those with just a high school education.

The St. Louis Fed has [data on this](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LEU0252917300A) going back to 1979. Between then and 2022, median nominal earnings among those with a high school education and no college degree have grown by about 242.6%, while the [price level as measured by the CPI](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL#0) has grown by about 303.14%. Looks like we can no longer dismiss this particular single-earner idea out of hand: wages haven't kept pace with prices for those without a college degree.

Not so fast. If you took a macro class and remember its content well, you'll know the CPI has its flaws. For one, it's calculated without adjusting for substitutions made by consumers. That's not the case for the PCE index, which we can apply directly to our data thanks to the magic of FRED. For simplicity's sake, I've indexed both earnings and the PCE to 1979 and divided the earnings index by the price index to show the change in real earnings in a way that can be easily understood in percentage terms. If earnings kept pace with prices exactly, the formula would just yield 100/100 = 1 for the final date. If they fell behind prices, we'd get a fraction less than one. [What do we see instead?](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=17yqB)

The median worker with only a high school education earned about 3.663% more in 2022 than in 1979. There have clearly been some rough times for this sort of person, but at the very least this data doesn't describe a downward trend.*

*(EDIT: There's an important point to attach to this, which I was made aware of thanks to /u/pepin-lebref : [Wages are down for men without a college education, relative to 1979.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=17yTL) This implies that the small bump observed above is due to increases in earnings among women. And to be a total pedant, yes, there are more than two genders, and no, that doesn't really affect the conclusion here. The important thing is that this part of the R1 was sort of wrong because it is harder for men, in particular, to pull off the single-earner lifestyle described in the tweet in 2022 compared to 1979.)

But let's focus on the point: was there ever a time when it was normal for a single earner to comfortably support a family of five with just a high school education? To our misfortune, there isn't a dataset looking specifically at the earnings of those with only a high school education adjusted for the cost of supporting a family of five over time. Putting together that data for every single year on record would be very time-consuming, so I’ll focus on 1979 before doing anything else.

The nominal median weekly wage in this data, in 1979, was $249. With one week of vacation time, that translates to $12,699 a year, but I’ll steelman the opposing idea a little and go with the 52-week figure of $12,948. Now all we need is the typical cost of living for a family of five in 1979. This kind of data is surprisingly hard to find, but I did find [data from the BLS](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/05/art3full.pdf) that includes the median nominal cost of living for a family of four in 1979. This measure includes the cost of entertainment, but I think it's fair to interpret ""comfortably"" as meaning ""with a reasonable amount of money spent on leisure, for the time."" That comes out to $16,129, exceeding the calculated median salary.

So no, it looks like it wasn’t normal for a single high school graduate to provide a comfortable standard of living to a family of five in 1979. The trouble here is that we can’t be sure the median earner with a high school education was both 1. making the same amount of money as the median earner with a high school education and two kids to take care of and 2. paying for the same basket of goods. But we’d have to make some great leaps from our limited data to assume it was really typical for one high school graduate to take care of a family of five comfortably: the budget we found was about 24.6% higher than the calculated salary, and we’re talking about somebody with three kids to take care of, not the two kids in the four-person family this budget was calculated for. Unless someone else responds to this with better (and contradictory) data, we should be able to reject the idea in the post I linked with a fair amount of certainty.

But maybe we just need to look further back. 1979 wasn’t that long ago, and as we all know, [everything started to get worse before then, in 1971.](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/) (Note for if you're just visiting the lands of BE: that site is fairly well known here for being very wrong about everything.) How about 1960?

I don't have the data to provide a clear picture of that time, but I do have [data on the prevalence of single-earner married-couple households in the US going back to 1967](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2014/ted_20140602.htm). (Props to /u/BernankesBeard for sharing a link to this data with me.) Back then, only about 35.6% of married-couple families had just the husband working, while 43.6% of them had both the husband and wife working. Just as described by Linda Gordon, the single-earner picture of families in the US doesn't accurately characterize the 60s (or at least the late 60s).

Nothing that I have shared here directly contradicts the idea that it used to be normal for a high school graduate in the US to support a family of five comfortably without anyone else bringing in income. And you might extrapolate backward from that BLS data on married-couple families to conclude it used to be normal for the husband to be the only worker. But even then, which type of family do you think tended to have three kids more often: the one with just one earner, or the one with multiple? It’s more likely that the three-child households in this data were concentrated among two-earner households, meaning it wasn't ""normal"" for a single earner to support a family of five back then. More likely, it was normal for two earners to support a family of five, because families with more kids need more money for them to be fed and clothed.

Limitations aside, it isn’t reasonable to look at the data we have and come to the conclusion that the idyllic economy the denizens of /r/facepalm wish they had used to be real in the United States. You have to make a lot of big assumptions to reach that conclusion:

1. Single-earner households were more common before 1967 than during that time, AND
2. A significant number of those households had three or more kids, AND
3. The earners in those households made more money than suggested by the data, AND/OR
4. A five-person household's budget would have been less expensive than suggested by the data, OR
5. The data is fabricated by THEM

Assumption 5 is my personal favorite. I wouldn't call this post conclusive, but until we get a better one, maybe we should stop getting so nostalgic for a time that, by all that we can tell, really didn't exist.",Skeeh,t2_y8jiy,0.91,314,117

Hoo, boy.   Here we go.   I can't guarantee this will be a good RI, but ah well.

OP argues:

>In an attempt to refute the so-called ""productivity-pay gap,"" some people have claimed that \[..\] ""total compensation has tracked productivity perfectly.""\[...\] There is only one problem with this happy narrative: it's factually wrong.  According to a 2016 report from the St. Louis Fed, ""labor productivity has been growing at a higher rate than labor compensation for more than 40 years.""\[..\] Similarly, a 2017 report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that ""since the 1970s, productivity and compensation \[defined as base pay plus benefits\] have steadily diverged.""

This is surprising, because according to [Kaldor's facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaldor%27s_facts), wages follow productivity pretty stably in the long run, so this would be a great surprise.   As it happens, it's inaccurate.

The BLS ([Brill et al. (2017)](https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-6/mobile/understanding-the-labor-productivity-and-compensation-gap.htm)) and St. Louis Fed reports ([Ravikumar & Shao (2016)](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2016/08/12/labor-compensation-and-labor-productivity-recent-recoveries-and-the-long-term-trend/)) plot real compensation and productivity using the CPI deflator, which obtains results that there has been a gradual gap since the 70s ([Chart 1, Brill et al. 'Understanding the labor productivity and compensation gap'](https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-6/images/productivity-and-compensation-chart-1.png),  [Figure 3, Ravikumar & Shao, 'Labor Compensation and Labor Productivity: Recent Recoveries and the Long-Term Trend'](https://files.stlouisfed.org/research/publications/economic-synopses/2016-08-12/labor-compensation-and-labor-productivity-recent-recoveries-and-the-long-term-trend.pdf)).   However, other authors don't, such as [Lawrence (2015)](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/growing-gap-between-real-wages-and-labor-productivity) and [Feldstein (2008)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w13953).

So what is the problem?

There are multiple.

Ravikumar & Shao measure labor productivity as "" real total output divided by total hours worked"", and Brill et al. puts it as ""real output per hour worked"". This seems normal enough.  However, the problem is in the nature of the productivity measures.    Real GDP=nominal GDP/GDP deflator.  You can use [NDP (net domestic product)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_domestic_product) to account for capital depreciation (NDP=GDP-depreciation), which no one, including labor, can consume, and some type of NDP deflator.   GDP and NDP deflators are [chained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chained_dollars).    But the CPI is a fixed-weight index, and because of this, prices will rise under the CPI faster than under GDP deflators.    [Figure 1; Church, ‘Comparing the Consumer Price Index with the gross domestic product price index and gross domestic product implicit price deflator”](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2016/images/church-figure1.png) illustrates the discrepancies between the CPI and GDP deflators--as can be seen, the CPI rises faster.  Source: ([Church 2016](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2016/article/comparing-the-cpi-with-the-gdp-price-index-and-gdp-implicit-price-deflator.htm)) Hence, a GDP or NDP deflator would rise slower than the CPI, and that productivity measures using GDP/NDP deflators would be higher than compensation measures using CPI as a deflator ([Figure 4; Lawrence, 'The Growing Gap Between Real Wages and Productivity'](https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/realtime/files/2015/07/lawrence20150721-figure4.png)), which means means you could get a productivity gap based purely on formula biases.

The other problem in using CPI in deflating compensation is that the CPI and NDP deflator measure different goods.   The NDP deflator, like the GDP deflator, would measure investment goods as well (Church 2016), whereas the CPI measures consumer goods.  This means there is additional composition bias added to the mix, so even if you could correct for formula bias, using the CPI is still not great. A better deflator for compensation might be the PCE (personal consumption expenditures) as, PCE and NDP deflator rise in tandem ([source](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1OoA)).

What are the BLS and St. Louis Fed measuring, then?   Probably the strongest case is that this is mostly attributable to wage inequality.  [Matt Rognlie](https://www.themoneyillusion.com/the-very-real-problem-of-wage-inequality/#comment-400287) gets really in depth—because of the methodological problems, a decline in the total share of labor is unlikely.  Wage inequality is likely what drives the gap reflected in productivity-pay graphs and the BLS and St. Louis Fed reports.

So the productivity compensation gap seen here is probably just good old wage inequality.

Edits to come as needed.

>In addition, part of the increase in total compensation reflects the increased cost of healthcare, which has [gone up significantly](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/report/2019-employer-health-benefits-survey/) in recent years. This causes an on-paper increase in benefits (as employers must pay more to provide coverage), but does not actually enhance wellbeing, and as such, it is a misleading indicator of worker compensation.

Well....kind of?    Total compensation reflects wages+benefits, so what this really reflects is an increase in healthcare expenditures.  If the real price of healthcare or insurance rose and employers did not cover it, compensation would decrease.    Given that health insurance is a large part of compensation, there does not seem to be any real economic reason against including it. ",Melvin-lives,t2_5838zdy2,0.95,209,25

I would like to thank badeconomics for inviting me here to discuss [Wumbo (2016)](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/57zb91/the_silver_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/d8x1ojw/). Wumbo's shitpost is a thought provoking and promising extension of applied wumbology to political philosophy. However, I have some suggestions regarding it's empirical strategy.

When evaluating the effect of any policies, [Heckman (2000)](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2000/heckman-lecture.pdf) reminds us that:

> Recognizing the potential importance of selection shapes the way we interpret economic and social data and gauge the effectiveness of social policy.

With that in mind, we revisit Wumbo (2016)'s claim that:

>Well, I expect socialists to be violent at heart because that's how all socialist governments have made sure they stayed in power.
 
Again, Heckman (2000) reminds us that:

> A sample selected by any rule not equivalent to random sampling produces a description of the population distribution of characteristics that does not accurately describe the true population distribution of characteristics no matter how big the sample size.

If socialists that form government undergo selection then we cannot naively infer the propensity for violence of the overall population. To understand whether or not we are concerned about selection it helps to have a theoretical model of the causality involved. For that, I suggest the framework developed by [Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2004)](http://economics.mit.edu/files/4469).

>economic institutions, and institutions more broadly, are *endogenous*; they are, at least in part, determined by society, or a segment of it

For a case study, I suggest 20th century Latin America as an interesting example. As we know from [Sala-I-Martin (1997)](http://www.nber.org/papers/w6252), Spanish colonies have suffered persistently low growth. Indeed, [Acemoglu and Robinson (2001)](http://economics.mit.edu/files/4123) explains that:

> The main objective of the Spanish and the Portuguese colonization was to obtain gold and other valuables from America. Soon after the conquest, the Spanish crown granted rights to land and labor (the encomienda) and set up a complex mercantilist system of monopolies and trade regulations to extract resources from the colonies.

Chile, as an ex Spanish colony, was saddled with extractive political and economic institutions. [Acemgolu, Egorov, and Sonin (2012)](http://economics.mit.edu/files/8797) develop a model of Latin American leftist populism: 

>Our starting point is that, as the examples suggest, the economies in question feature high levels of inequality and sufficiently weak political  institutions. These enable the rich elite (or a subset thereof) to have a disproportionate influence on politics. In fact, in many of these societies political corruption and political betrayal, where politicians use redistributive rhetoric but still end up choosing policies in line with the interests of the elite, are quite common This implies that voters often distrust politicians and believe that they may adopt a rhetoric of redistribution, leveling the playing field and defending the interests of the common man, but then pursue policies in the interests of the elite.  

Indeed, the socialists that rise to power in Latin America are likely to be populists responding to public anger about inequality and corruption. How is this linked to violence? [Acemoglu, Robinson, and Santos (2013)](http://economics.mit.edu/files/10402) study FARC violence in Columbia and argue:""

>Why are many states in less-developed societies unable to establish Weber’s famous monopoly of violence in their territories? The standard explanation relies on the inability of the central state to broadcast its power throughout the territories that it nominally controls and views an extension of this power to the periphery as a natural by-product of “political modernization”. In this paper we developed an alternative perspective, suggesting that the central state can develop (even “modernize”) without establishing such a monopoly of violence because there may be a symbiotic relationship between the parties controlling the central state and nonstate actors exercising power in the peripheries of the country. The origins of this symbiotic relationship is that nonstate armed actors can provide support to those controlling the central state. This
is particularly important in democracies where nonstate armed actors can control elections.

Extra legal violence can co-exist with states if the paramilitary groups have policy preferences in line with the politicians. In broad strokes, we now have the following model:

historical extractive institutions -> inequality -> populist anger -> ( violent paramilitaries <=> populist leaders)

The key here is that the leadership and violence are endogenous to historical institutions. To evaluate the inherent violence of socialists, we cannot rely on leaders in countries with histories of extractive institutions. 

Finally, in regards to a certain Chilean despot, [Acemoglu (2008)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/118d/93e80ec39ff7aee7ce92872766581612b2f6.pdf) reminds us that neoliberal economic reforms under non-inclusive politcal institutions is not necessarially better than redistribution under a politically inclusive institutions. (n.b. this is not to bash certain Chicago school economists who may have stuck their foot in their mouth by appearing to support Pinochet; the aforementioned scholar was a proponent of democratic governments and redistribution.) 

>Oligarchic societies not only protect the property rights of producers and prevent high levels of distortionary taxation, they also enable the politically   powerful elites to create a non–level playing field and a monopoly position for themselves. In contrast, democratic societies eschew the entry barriers that protect incumbent elites but create economic distortions in order to achieve a more egalitarian distribution of resources

497,170jls8,2023-10-05,badeconomics,The Great Society Didn’t Destroy Black America,"In our last post, we covered every economic claim made during the second Republican debate. Except one. An outlandish comment made by Senator Tim Scott was so broad and laden with historical baggage that I decided it needed its own post. Here it is:

“Black families survived slavery; we survived poll taxes and literacy tests; we survived discrimination being woven into the laws of our country; what was hard to survive was Johnson’s Great Society where they decided to put money, where they decided to take the black father out of the household to get a check in the mail. And you can now measure that in unemployment, in crime, in devastation.""

The implication that the Great Society programs wrought more long-lasting destruction to Black families than slavery was roundly mocked by most of the media (though defended in The Wall Street Journal). The New Republic panned it as “embarrassing,” while The New York Times’ Nikole Hannah-Jones openly wondered how it must feel to need to “disgrace your ancestors to have a chance [in a Republican primary].”

But Scott is far from alone in his assertions. Famous Black economists like Walter Williams and Thomas Sowell have spent the last half century contending that government programs intended to help Black Americans have done more harm than good. (This blog will review Sowell’s recently-released book in the coming weeks.) Scott’s comments are an echo of Williams’ words a decade sooner:

“The welfare state has done to black Americans what slavery couldn't do….And that is to destroy the black family.”

So, how did it supposedly do so? First, we better talk about the history of the welfare state.

The federal government’s involvement in providing welfare benefits took off in the 1930s during the Great Depression. With millions of Americans out of work, waiting in bread lines for food while meager state unemployment funds dried up, mass mobilizations of Americans demanded action from the federal government, and FDR delivered. In the 1930s, Americans gained Social Security, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC, what is colloquially called welfare), a federal unemployment insurance system, a national labor relations bill, a vast array of public works projects resulting in the federal government directly employing over 8 million Americans, and the first bill setting national standards for wages and hours nationwide. After the Great Depression passed, Americans (increasingly even Black Americans) enjoyed broader prosperity alongside the nation’s growing welfare state. 

The second major expansion of the welfare state, more modest than the first, could not claim to be backed by a mass mobilization (except on civil rights) like the one that drove Roosevelt. While radical critics of the American economy, among them Martin Luther King Jr., were calling for new federal measures like a guaranteed universal income and a massive public jobs program, they were ignored. Still, Johnson passed many important reforms including the establishment of Medicare and Medicaid, the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts, the expansion of food stamps, increased funds for poor school districts and Head Start for early childhood education, the Child Nutrition Act, and a reform to AFDC that would do more to incentivize work, all while overseeing one of the fastest real increases in the minimum wage. However, in the years after LBJ left office, America didn’t enjoy the same prosperity it did in its postwar years. High inflation, the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam war, deindustrialization, and the sexual revolution created a whole new country, for better and for worse, and many of the costs of this transformation were disproportionately borne by Black families.

According to its critics, the Great Society programs were largely responsible for driving Black Americans out of work, breaking up their families, and creating the sort of social or moral decay that resulted in the uprisings of the late 1960s and the longstanding issues of crime, unemployment, and single-parents homes in Black communities. However, as we’re about to see, the evidence for these propositions is slim and mixed at best. We’ll prioritize three topics here: wages, welfare, and the family.

Wages

The first labor laws to be subjected to the criticism of anti-Great-Society conservatives are actually FDR’s reforms in the aftermath of the Great Depression. Here’s a summary of that critique from Thomas Sowell:

“From the late nineteenth-century on through the middle of the twentieth century, the labor force participation rate of American blacks was slightly higher than that of American whites. In other words, blacks were just as employable at the wages they received as whites were at their very different wages. The minimum wage law changed that. Before federal minimum wage laws were instituted in the 1930s, the black unemployment rate was slightly lower than the white unemployment rate in 1930. But then followed the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933 and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938 – all of which imposed government-mandated minimum wages, either on a particular sector or more broadly… By 1954, black unemployment rates were double those of whites and have continued to be at that level or higher.”

Sowell gets some things right here. Black and white unemployment rates were roughly equal in 1930, and they remained so in the 1940 census, despite all of the policies Sowell mentioned having taken effect. The Black unemployment rate would not become nearly double the white rate until the 1950 census. 


But it’s more than a bit misleading to blame FDR’s labor laws for nationwide changes that appeared in the national data roughly ten years after their first implementation. Breaking down the census data Sowell uses by region provides much-needed clarity. The Black/white unemployment ratio was already nearly 2 to 1 in large parts of the North in 1930. Similarly, Black unemployment was lower than white unemployment nationwide because Black Americans disproportionately lived in the South where the unemployment rate was consistently lower than the rest of the country. The low wages, sharecropping system, and dependency of tenant farmers (not to mention the region’s relative lack of reliance on the financial sector) kept a great share of the population at work.

498,cx6j9z,2019-08-29,badeconomics,"The ""Hot Hand Fallacy"" Fallacy: How a few top cognitive bias researchers fell into their own trap","The ""Hot Hand Fallacy"" is the idea that a current streak of good outcomes increases your likelihood of subsequent good outcomes. It comes from peoples' natural tendency to recognize patterns, even ones that aren't significant or may not even exist. The term was coined in a 1985 study that examined the discrepancy between how basketball players and fans saw streaks of good shooting, and their statistical reality.

In 1985, Gilovich, Tversky (two very foundational figures in behavioral economics), and Vallone penned a now famous paper titled *The Hot Hand in Basketball.* This paper used data from 1981 Philadelphia 76ers home games (presumably because 76ers publicist [Harvey Pollack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Pollack) kept the most in depth statistical records in the league) to study whether the ""hot hand"" phenomenon existed. The paper concluded that

> The belief in the hot hand and the “detection” of streaks in random sequences is attributed to a general misconception of chance 
according to which even short random sequences are thought to be highly rep-
resentative of their generating process.

In other words, the hot hand is just p-hacking. Patterns in player shooting streaks are just random variance in small samples of a larger dataset, which the human brain mistakes for a pattern. 

The paper gained massive attention, and the term 'hot hand fallacy"" entered the lexicon of both academic and pop science as a useful description of a common phenomenon, and the empirical findings became universal academic consensus for decades. It was not until nearly two decades later that some clever statisticians reexamined the study and found what really should have been clear from the start: **the empirical findings of *The Hot Hand in Basketball* flatly false, and the researchers made the exact mental mistake they were studying.** Driven by previous success in exposing cognitive bias, Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky drew false conclusions from a small sample of data.

The core problem with the study was sample size. The Gilovich et al looked at a sample of 48 games played in Philadelphia in the 1981 NBA season. This represents *less than 5%* of the 998 regular season and playoff games played in the 1981 NBA season, concentrated among a single group of players. The authors made a sweeping conclusion about the nature of streakiness in basketball based on less than 1/20th of an NBA season. That's absurd! This was first noted in a 2003 review of the study by Kevin B. Korb and Michael Stillwell ([pdf link](https://web.archive.org/web/20130927050854/http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~korb/iccs.pdf)), who examined the data and concluded that

> (Gilovich et al's) belief in having demonstrated the illusory
status of the Hot Hand is itself an illustration of the Law of
Small Numbers, for their statistical tests were of such low
power that they could not have been expected to find a Hot
Hand even if it were present.

And additionally

> The
only statistically significant results tend to support the
claim that there are too many runs for a single binomial
process, whereas the Hot Hand thesis would lead us to
expect the opposite.

In short, GVT used a sample size too small to draw a positive conclusion from, and then took the lack of positive conclusion as a negative conclusion.

As Korb and Stillwell suspected, newer studies have indeed shown the exact opposite of GVT's conclusion. Two studies in particular are the significant:

[A 2014 study presentes at the Sloan Analytics conference](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/content/the-hot-hand-a-new-approach-to-an-old-fallacy/) analysed all field goal attempts taken in the 2013 (25.6x larger sample than GVT), and additionally, used player tracking technology that records the distance of shots and the proximity of the closest defender. The study found that

> players who have outperformed over recent shots shoot from significantly further away, face tighter defense, and are more likely to take their team’s next shot. We then turn to the Hot Hand itself and show that players who are outperforming will continue to do so by a small but significant amount, once we control for the difficulty of the present shot.

[A 2011 study by Gur Yaari and Shmuel Eisenmann](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3187751/) examined 5 regular seasons of league-wide free throw shooting data (128x larger sample than GVT) found a

> statistically significance correlation between the results of consecutive free throw attempts. In our notation *P*(1|1)>*P*(1|0), an increase in the conditional probability (CP), which is usually referred to as a “hot hand”.

However, the authors also propose that

> The increase in the conditional probability is due to time fluctuations in the probability of success rather than a causal connection between the results of consecutive throws.

In other words, players don't become more likely to hit a subsequent shot after making the first, but instead enter sequences (i.e. games, quarters, free throw trips) more likely to make shots. This fits empirical data: because players are more likely to shoot better if they are in better health, or had 1+ rest days between games, or [get off Twitter earlier](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.www.complex.com/sports/2018/11/nba-players-late-night-tweets-harm-performance), players wake up on certain days more likely to hit shots than others, which creates inherent streakiness in player shooting. GVT's failure to find this in the data is a reflection of their miniscule sample size. And even if this form of streakiness isn't the first thing that comes to mind when people think ""hot hand,"" it is still the exact effect that GVT claimed did not exist: **even after adjusting for all in-game factors, individual players are more likely to make their next shot if they have made their last.**

Did GVT get some things right? Yes. The hot hand effect is likely much smaller than the average player or fan would assume. Part of this is because players in aggregate are much more likely to make a shot if they have made their last (good shooters are more likely to have made their last shot, and make their next), and certain in-game factors (mainly quality of opponent defense) may cause players to shoot better or worse, either of which may be confused with individual player streakiness. However, the principal finding of the study was empirically wrong, and the way they reached it should have raised flags when it was published. 

**In conclusion:**

Do people overestimate the hot hand effect in basketball? Probably

Is Gilovich et al's *The Hot Hand in Basketball* a useful study? No

If an individual basketball player has made their last shot, does that indicate a greater likelihood of making their next shot? Yes",BEE_REAL_,t2_ldfnk,0.98,234,53

501,4gu60i,2016-04-28,badeconomics,Senator Sanders College plan seems like it isn't well thought out.,"http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/collegeforallsummary/?inline=file

Sen. Sanders hopes to make all 4 year state colleges free. This is a terrible idea in the way he is implementing it. 

He states that colleges must reduce ballooning costs, but then states they cannot rely on low-paid adjunct faculty, while at the same time claiming that they must hire new faculty, provide for professional development, and increase academic opportunities for students.  So he is somehow expecting a state to cut the cost and increase the spending on the program, I think there’s an accounting problem.

>No funding under this program may be used to fund administrator salaries, merit-based financial aid, or the construction of non-academic buildings like stadiums and student centers

So he wants hundreds of thousands of new students to get into schools but doesn’t want to pay for the administrators needed to handle that many new kids?

Plus I’m all for no stadium spending but there is infrastructure needed to support these thousands of students you want to be going to these universities that will require massive funding. Where are they all going to eat, study, and sleep?

>Student loan interest rates would be cut almost in half for undergraduate students, dropping from 4.32% to just 2.32%. 

Great I still have 40,000 in debt but my interest rate is cut in half. While I have to compete with students that as Sen. Sanders claims will be going to college debt free.  So not only will he make my degree worth less because it will be easier for people to get and there will be more people with it, he is also giving them less of a financial burden to have to overcome on the other side. Why does anyone with a college degree like this plan?

>Fully paid for by imposing a Robin Hood tax on Wall Street


http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b9b40fee-9236-11e2-851f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz4786eAj5P

Sweden tried this at a lower level than what Sanders proposes. Their trading volume fell by 60% and collected less than 20% of what they expected to collect. On top of this most firms moved to London and other major financial centers. Once the tax was removed trading resumed at a near previous level after 3 years. It’s a terrible idea to pay for a bad idea.

Now theres a specific point he doesn’t cover that’s very important. He likes to compare this system to Germany and other Nordic countries. He doesn’t however mention how he will control degrees. There is a massive skills gap right now because people get degrees in things that are not currently useful. There is social value to these degrees but there isn’t a direct economic benefit. These degrees used to have the issue of creating a lot of debt with little job prospect but once you take away the debt portion doesn’t it just create a way for someone to take 4 year vacation? 

If he were to implement a German model than it would be a very controlled system where only those who qualify can get in, there is only a set number of each degree available, and the companies help sponsor the students. He is in no way shape or form proposing this system.

Now the claim that the gender wage cap doesn't exists is wrong on two accounts I will bring up. [Firstly that women on the whole earn .75:1 as compared to men](http://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/archive/highlights-of-womens-earnings-in-2013.pdf). Now the clear problem with this statistic is that women generally choose lower paying careers or have career path's interrupted more greatly parenthood then men do. I would argue that this is a problem but what I suspect the poster's point is that when you control for other variables that the wage gap disappears. However this is also wrong [as is pointed out here](http://www.hawaii.edu/religion/courses/Gender_Wage_Gap_Report.pdf) with an ""adjusted gender wage gap that is between 4.8 and 7.1 percent"". Now obviously 4.8-7.1% is a far cry from 25% as is sometimes claimed this is clearly NOT ""equal pay for equal work"" so it would be ludicrous to say that the gender wage gap *doesn't* exists, just that it isn't a strong as the media would sometimes have implied.

Okay this is a really simple R1. Now he would be right if what he is talking about is the noise involved in such a statistic because clearly on a case by case basis a high school dropout could easily out earn a Ph D. with straight A's. [However, as we can see for degrees](http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm) we clearly see large differences in the aggregate. Now we also need to look at the oppritunity cost of going to college but even accounting for that https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci20-3.pdf granted this only looks at a bachelors degree but I would be unwilling to say that getting an advanced degree that isn't a professional degree is likely to be the best finical decision. Finally grades do not generally have a casual relationship to income but they [defiantly correlate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/05/20/heres-how-much-your-high-school-grades-predict-how-much-you-make-today/).

For the purpose of this R1 I am going to interpreter this comment as being generally anti-Obama care and not, as is the literal interpretation, that 
Obama-care doesn't exists. Largely there are two way you could judge the effectiveness of a given health care policy  (so far as I can tell. I would not be surprised to learn I am wrong). Those are the relative levels of enrollment (i.e. what enrollment was before and after the policy) and the relative costs of health care i.e. what the cost of health care was before and after the policy). [As Krugman points out here](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/23/opinion/health-reform-lives.html) post Obama-care enrollment is up and insurance premiums are down. At the very Obama-care at least seems like less of a lie then the commenter seems to imply.

Found and article of /r/economy (my first mistake) about how half of well-paying jobs required coding. This comment was on the top.


>This is because software is a tax-free rent source, so people are still investing in it because the returns are potentially astronomical.

First of all, it's not tax-free. The coders are taxed on income and the firm is taxed on profits. I really don't understand how this is different from anything else. Although it's not specifically stated, this behaviour is rent seeking... or something. However, at least OP understands that due to the high productivity of coding as evidenced by the high salaries, their potential returns are astronomical. 

>The software being created isn't all that useful, but it's potentially extremely valuable.

Why? I imagine most software is useful in the sense that it helps increase somebody's utility. Even candy crush is useful and most software is used in production or analytics so even more ""useful."" Also, it's not like software is a luxury good like a Rolex which would have less use than say a car. Anyways, this part is so dumb I can't even.

>This creates artificially high demand in a market where there's very little potential for returns elsewhere.

Firms can make more money by creating code than other activities in the economy. This requires coders. Coders wages are increased. I don't see anything artificial about it since the whole premise of tax-free rent seeking is insane in this case.

On occasion, he actually calls himself an economist. He generally writes about how America is imploding any day now, and everything is collapsing, and so on. Of course, he has absolutely no idea what he's talking about and routinely gets even basic stats wrong. I'll be R1ing a few things he wrote.

From ""[The American Economy is Still Imploding](https://eand.co/the-american-economy-is-still-imploding-4c8a1c369a51)"" (June 5):

>I was surprised to read today — as you were, perhaps — that the American unemployment rate fell in May, to 13 percent or so... **The unemployment rate — the real one — is higher than 16%**

This is good economics. There was a mistake in the BLS jobs report where some employees were mistakenly counted as employed, and the BLS estimates the real unemployment rate is about 3% higher than the official rate (putting it at about 16.3%).

>The true unemployment rate isn’t falling; it’s climbing. **Not my opinion — the government’s own admission.**

And here is where he can't read. The unemployment rate still fell because [this error was present](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_05082020.htm) in April as well, where the unemployment rate was under-stated by *almost 5%* (meaning it should have been about 19.7%). The ""official"" rate fell from 14.7% to 13.3%. The corrected rate fell from \~19.7% to \~16.3%. It went down either way. I don't know if this is bad economics or just bad reading comprehension.

>So how high is it? My guess is it’s about 20% at the moment.

And then he adds an extra 4% to the unemployment rate for literally no reason at all.

From ""[The economy is self-destructing](https://eand.co/the-economy-is-self-destructing-dc66efa26b2f)"" (August 23):

>But that’s the percent of Americans active in work. And that percent has been [declining for decades](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CIVPART). It peaked from 1990–2000, when nearly 70% of **working age** Americans were part of the labour force, meaning they were working or seeking work.

Here, Umair is referring to the labor force participation rate (LFPR) (and links to it on FRED). I will take a slight issue with him calling it ""working age"" Americans though--the [labor force](https://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm#L) includes all those 16 and older in the civilian non-institutional population. My 96 year old retired great-aunt is still included in the denominator of the LFPR, but not many people would consider her ""working age"". What most people call the ""working age"" labor force participation would be for those [age 25-54](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300060). It's a semantic issue, but I think it's one worth clarifying when you're audience likely has little to no formal economics knowledge. This is also important because at least *part* of the decline in labor force participation rates has been [due to demographic changes](https://www.frbatlanta.org/chcs/labor-force-participation-dynamics.aspx) (mainly the fact that a lot of people got old and retired). He also later uses some very funny rounding to imply the LFPR dropped by 10%, but the reality is more like \~4%.

He then switches to talking about the employment rate, where he fucks that up too.

>Just a quarter of working age Americans had good jobs pre-Covid. The rest? Another quarter had crap jobs, “low-income service jobs,” which in plainer English are go-nowhere McJobs, Uber drivers, and so forth. ***And the remaining roughly half of working age America wasn’t employed at all.***

This is just plainly false. Exactly how false depends on how we define ""working age"". If we look at the [employment-population ratio](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EMRATIO) (again, including all those 16 and older that aren't institutionalized), then roughly 39% of ""working age America"" didn't have a job pre-COVID. But if you think my great-aunt isn't working age (as I happen to believe), then we should likely put some better age parameters on this. If we look at the [employment rate of those ages 15-64](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LREM64TTUSM156S), then about 29% didn't have a job pre-COVID. If we define [working age as 25-54](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LREM25TTUSM156S) (hopefully keeping many full-time students and early retirees out), then it was more like 20%.

And just to explain this since many readers here aren't experts in economics, I think this is worth clarifying. Measures like the LFPR or the employment rate includes people that have *no desire to work* in the denominator (meaning most of those people that have no job aren't looking for one). Maybe they're a student, disabled, retired, staying home and taking care of kids, too busy posting misleading ""economics"" on Medium, or whatever else. Point being, there are many people that *aren't* working for perfectly fine reasons--that doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. Or maybe something is wrong, but you're going to have to look a lot deeper than ""Some people don't have jobs!"" to find out.

From ""[(How Social Democracy Liberated Europeans From) How Capitalism Exploits Americans](https://eand.co/how-social-democracy-liberated-europeans-from-how-capitalism-exploits-americans-9920464c25db)"":

>The numbers say that only 5% of Americans work second jobs — but again, that’s a poor representation of reality...  A better number comes from **Gallup**. How many people did they find work “multiple jobs”, counting the gig economy? Wait for it, the number’s kind of shocking. **About 40% of Americans work more than one job.** Wait — what? Does that sound like a rich country to you?

And one last time, Umair is incapable of reading. He's referring to [this report from Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/240929/workplace-leaders-learn-real-gig-economy.aspx), which does in fact say 36% of workers are in the gig economy (using a *very* broad definition of ""gig jobs""). But if you go to page 8 of that report, it has [this wonderful chart](https://imgur.com/a/85qcRy2). If you add up all the categories of two-job holders, you arrive at 22%, not 40%. Umair is counting people who had one gig job (and nothing else) as multiple-job holders.

>On January 6, 2004, Senator Charles Schumer and I challenged the erroneous idea that jobs offshoring was free trade in a New York Times op-ed. Our article so astounded economists that within a few days Schumer and I were summoned to a Brookings Institution conference in Washington, DC, to explain our heresy. In the nationally televised conference, I declared that the consequence of jobs offshoring would be that the US would be a Third World country in 20 years.

>That was 11 years ago, and the US is on course to descend to Third World status before the remaining nine years of my prediction have expired.

The price index calculated by the CB overstates inflation relative to other, better price indexes.  This ends up making actual income gains look like they shrink due to higher prices.

507,9oc9rm,2018-10-15,badeconomics,"Sowell: ""Minimum wage increases unemployment""","> Supply-and-demand says that above-market prices create unsaleable surpluses, but that has not stopped most of Europe from regulating labor markets into decades of depression-level unemployment.

—Bryan Caplan, quoted by Thomas Sowell, Basic Economics, Fifth Edition, page 220.

>Minimum wage laws make it illegal to pay less than a government-specified price for labor.  By the simplest and most basic economics, a price artificially raised tends to cause more to be supplied and less to be demanded than when prices are left to be determined by supply and demand in a free market.  The result is a surplus, whether the price that is set artificially high is that of farm produce or labor.

Sowell argues that minimum wage is the cause of unemployment, in essence, and that higher minimum wage leads to higher unemployment.  This is, of course, plainly not backed up by empirical evidence.

Several papers have examined the economics of unemployment and labor, notably *Population, Unemployment and Economic Growth Cycles: A Further Explanatory Perspective* (Fanati et al, 2003).  Fanati and Manfredi observe several things, notably that unemployment may increase or decrease fertility rates.  If welfare is sufficient that unemployment is favorable to fertility, higher unemployment tends to increase fertility rates, and thus higher unemployment rates can self-sustain.

Raising the minimum wage reduces job opportunities:  ceteris parabus, the same consumer spending must concentrate into fewer workers's hands.  The economy will of course respond in all kinds of ways; this is only the basic, one-variable outcome.

If welfare is sufficiently high, then fertility rates will increase, so suppose Fanati and Manfredi, sustaining this increased unemployment rate.

What if we raised the minimum wage so far that welfare is significantly lower than minimum wage, or otherwise increased that gap—such as by phasing out welfare well into lower-middle-income or providing a universal basic income or universal dividend?

Loss of employment would entail loss of means, negatively impacting fertility decisions.  This suggests a higher minimum wage leads, long-term, to reduced population growth and control of unemployment—which seems to be exactly what happens in many nations with high minimum wages and strong welfare states.

Labor isn't generally constrained by the supply of labor, either.  Later retirement, early entry into the workforce, and migrant labor all can move to fill labor demand; and a loss of labor demand will reduce the marginal benefits of immigrating into a nation (high unemployment tends to make immigrants look somewhere else for job opportunities, and nations stop accepting legal immigrant laborers).

In other words: the demand for laborers creates the supply of laborers; demand for jobs by workers doesn't create jobs.  Demand for goods provides revenue and a need for labor, which creates demand for laborers—jobs—and otherwise the revenue to pay those laborers doesn't exist, and the jobs cannot be supplied.  Thus the demand is for goods, which creates demand for labor, which affects immigration and fertility decisions to increase supply of labor.

The observation that great welfares increase supply of labor is not wrong; it's only contextual.  The observation that greater minimum wages increase supply of labor is patently-absurd, as population growth is affected by decisions based around the economics of supporting that population growth, and minimum wage artificially gates access to means—minimum wage increases, ceteris parabus, reduce the number of jobs available, thus reducing the number of people who can access resources, acting as a general constraint of resource availability.

Let’s start with this section of the article:

>As for the alarm about too many old people and not enough young, that reads like a weird science-fiction story — the old need caring for, and young people can’t take care of them while doing all the other jobs that need doing. Crisis!

>It sounds like full employment to me.

>Note that full employment as a concept carries political weight, because economists tend to say there is a “natural” unemployment rate of around 5 percent, and if this rate goes lower, it’s bad for … profits, basically. If unemployment dips below 5 percent, the thinking goes, the labor market tightens and the stock market gets depressed, because there is more competition for workers, and higher wages need to be offered to grab available workers, so profits drop, and inflation might occur, etc.

Some background information: [full employment means that the unemployment rate is equal to the natural unemployment rate](http://faculty.washington.edu/ezivot/econ301/301l5_1.htm), which *is* estimated to be around 5%. [Natural unemployment arises from difficulties in matching employees with employers](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/03/06/what-is-u/). People move between jobs, get fired or laid off, and sometimes are only just entering the workforce recently, and haven’t found a job yet. The natural unemployment rate is also known as the NAIRU, or the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. When the unemployment rate is higher than this rate, there’s a lot of people competing for jobs, and so wages fall, causing prices and thus inflation to fall as well. The opposite occurs when the unemployment rate is lower than the NAIRU: employers compete for workers, wages rise, and inflation rises as well. [This is described in the Phillips curve](https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2020/january/what-is-phillips-curve-why-flattened). However, as described in the linked article, this relationship has weakened in the US due to the efforts of the Federal Reserve to keep inflation low and stable.

In this case, what Robinson is describing is an aging population dipping below the natural rate of unemployment due to the increase in the number of old people. This doesn't make sense, because demographic factors change the NAIRU itself. Young people are unemployed at a higher rate than older people and are responsible for a larger part of the NAIRU due to how often they are only recently entering the labor force, or have gotten laid off. So, when the population ages, the NAIRU falls, because young people then make up a smaller share of the population.

What *does* happen when the population ages? In a previous version of this post I used the example case of Japan to show that it forces people to work more and retire later in life, but that’s primarily due to Japanese cultural standards that encourage work, which have existed for decades. (However, I will say that the aging population has probably reinforced those standards by creating a justification for them.) [What Japan does have because of its aging population is an unusually low unemployment rate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/business/japan-unemployment.html), because [the aging population is causing a labor shortage.](https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&context=geog_masterpapers) Additionally, it’s making it hard for the government to maintain its social security system.

Now, I’m going to go out on a limb and prax my way through the overworking part. If the global population declined due to lower birth rates, the workforce would shrink compared to the retirement age population. Consequently, people in the labor force would have to either become more productive, work longer hours, or retire later in life, in order to maintain the current standard of living. Increased productivity would be great, but the workforce can’t spontaneously become more productive when it’s convenient, and so longer hours and later retirement would ensue. Normally, you could solve this problem by encouraging immigration, but we’re talking about a global population decline: we can’t import more workers from Mars. We'd merely be shifting the problem around, which could dampen the effects in some places, but it wouldn't eliminate the problem.

Robinson is correct that [wages rise when the labor market is tight](https://www.epi.org/blog/evidence-that-tight-labor-markets-really-will-increase-labors-share-of-income-economic-policy-institute-macroeconomics-newsletter/). But if the population ages, [more of what workers produce will be focused on taking care of the elderly, diverted away from other things like education and infrastructure spending](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/05/02/two-solutions-to-the-challenges-of-population-aging/). This diversion of resources is already occurring in Japan.

>In other words, the precarity and immiseration of the unemployed would disappear as everyone had access to work that gave them an income and dignity and meaning (one new career category: restoring and repairing wildlands and habitat corridors for our cousin species)

I don’t have much to say about this except 1. there’s no reason to expect that unemployed people would either cease to exist or stop being unhappy with the fact that they don’t have a job, and 2. “dignity and meaning” is fairly subjective and there’s no reason to expect that people would have more of it if they’re overworked, retiring later, and directing more of their money towards the elderly.

>The 20th century’s immense surge in human population would age out and die off (sob), and a smaller population would then find its way in a healthier world. To make this work, their economic system might have to change — oh my God! But they will probably be up to that mind-boggling task.

Sometimes it’s best to take a step back from economic systems and think about what you have to work with. Populations that are older on average have fewer young people and more old people. The young will have to work more to provide for the old, or the old will have to work more, in order to maintain the current standard of living. There’s no convoluted escape from that fact involving the tax code or who owns what. As we’ve explored, that’s a big problem. Maybe if you perfected the law, you could accelerate technological growth and bring your fully automated luxury gay space communism dreams to life, but that’s not what the author is suggesting. (At least, I hope not, given how impractical that would be.)

I am declaring this a ~~non-~~ potential problem. Meanwhile, the world is faced with a lot of real problems that need addressing, including this article.

510,15ieos7,2023-08-05,badeconomics,Badeconomics is tone-deaf about the livelihood of Americans.,"I'm going to R1 [this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/15hi9nn/no_it_was_never_normal_for_one_person_with_a_high/). The crux the original post comes down to the meaning of ""support"". In any society individuals spend between 30-70 hrs/week working at home and in commerce. In the second half of the 20th century, this was very sexually dimorphic, [men performed ~5x as much commercial labour as women](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-weekly-hours-worked-per-person-by-age-group-united-states?time=earliest..2005), and women performed [~10x as much household labour as men](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/weekly-hours-dedicated-to-home-production-in-the-usa-by-gender). Ramey & Francis (2009) find women work a few more hours than men, but Aguiar & Hurst (2006) find the [reverse](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/hours-per-week-spent-in-market-and-non-market-work-by-sex-united-states).

This gradually, but in an anthropological sense rather rapidly, changed over the 19^th and 20^th centuries. Firstly, [because of the automation](https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/share-of-us-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances_1350.webp), secondly, because of the the increasing availability of outsourcing/commercialization of much home production (e.g. processed food, public school, etc.).

>First, take a look at the real median personal income in the US... the “normal” American has been making more and more money since 1974

While it is indeed true that median income has risen in the US, we need to think about this in terms of opportunity costs and counterfactuals.

- In two adult family households, having both adults engage in the commercial labour force brings about a whole bunch of new costs: childcare, another commute, possibly another vehicle, more commercially prepared meals, more taxes, increased capital intensity in home production (think washing machines), etc. This doesn't mean that there were *no gains* from the entry of women into the commercial labour market, but they're not as large as ""graph go up"" might seem to imply. 

- When we account for [education levels alone](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=17Avf), it can be observed that wages have underperformed output for every education level. 

- The age structure of the labour force is [shifting upwards](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/median-age-labor-force.htm) towards the period when earnings peak.

- When we look strictly at men without college education working full time, their wages have [unambiguously fallen](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=17AAm), and this isn't even accounting for ageing.

The argument usually made here is that productivity must have declined, I don't buy this. Wage's have underperformed productivity even for the sector of the economy that is allegedly driving output growth, and [rising productivity in one sector is expected to lift earnings in other sectors anyway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol_effect). 

---

All of this actually misses a big part of why so many people exhibit this frustrated attitude about cost of living. In particular medical care, education, vehicles, and housing have all become increasingly expensive relative to other goods and services (I don't even need to cite this one), and they're all considered ""essentials"". Unlike with ""essentials"" such as food and fuel (which have seen prices gradually fall), these are not frequent purchases that can easily be adjusted to price changes: you either need a lot of savings *now* (which young people generally don't have) or you need to lock in and commit to paying a fixed cost over time (it is very difficult to convince banks that *your* earnings will rise, even if it's statistically likely), which produces a lot of uncertainty and frustration.

And that frustration is justified. [There are lots of adults  who can't afford to live on their own](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2018/01/31/more-adults-now-share-their-living-space-driven-in-part-by-parents-living-with-their-adult-children/). I can't find a series for how many medical driven bankruptcies have changed over the years, but it's well established as a [leading factor](https://pnhp.org/new_bankruptcy_study/Bankruptcy-2009.pdf#page=3).

Finally, you cannot quite show that the poor in America have higher consumption than they used to to ""debunk"" the original post. In the eyes of most people, being dependent upon transfer payments to sustain consumption levels does not equate to being ""self supporting"", and so transfer payment increases that have offset growing inequality do not fully offset the psychosocial effects of that inequality.",pepin-lebref,t2_6dhue4kw,0.59,21,85

512,cnetce,2019-08-08,badeconomics,Are labour markets currently tight? How do we know?,"So the intent of this effortpost is mostly to clarify a couple concepts for people who may not have an extensive economics background, and hopefully give an overview of the main issues and arguments around the current state of the U.S./developed world labour market(s). Hopefully it will serve as a good refresher/basic reference for future discussions as well.

**What is meant by a ""tight"" labour market?**

There are several ways to define a tight labour market. For the purposes of this post, a tight labour market could be defined as one where the unemployment rate is low relative to its ""usual"" level. By that definition, the U.S. labour market is currently very tight, with the lowest unemployment rate since the late 60s ([Graph](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)).

**Indicators of a tight labour market**

A low unemployment rate is correlated with many other indicators; for instance, a high job openings rate:

The job openings rate is the ratio of job openings to total labour demand (job openings + current employment). So a high job openings rate means that employers have a hard time finding qualified workers to satisfy demand for their products. Usually, the unemployment rate and job openings rate are [inversely correlated](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=oArv), a phenomenon which is probably best visualised by a [Beveridge curve](https://www.bls.gov/charts/job-openings-and-labor-turnover/job-openings-unemployment-beveridge-curve.htm). *Usually*, this is expected to be a line or curve going from the upper left (tight labour market, low unemployment and high job openings) to the lower right (loose labour market, high unemployment and low job openings). As can be seen, there seems to have been a shift of the Beveridge curve towards a state with a higher job openings rate after the Great Recession, for reasons that are still under debate.

Maybe more importantly, a low unemployment rate tends to be correlated with accelerating inflation, also known as the [Phillips curve](https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/images/uploads/2018/Figure%205_20181015032933.jpg) ([another graph](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20171104_WOC123.png)). These Phillips curve were quite popular until the 90s, but as the graphs show, the relationship became much weaker afterwards. There are a number of theories that attempt to explain this: for instance, it's possible inflation expectations have become so well anchored that inflation is simply less responsive to changes in the unemployment rate than it was before.

**NAIRU**

A concept related to the Phillips curve is the NAIRU: Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment. Also sometimes called the ""natural"" or ""neutral"" rate of unemployment, this is the rate such that, if the actual unemployment rate falls below, inflation starts to pick up. Conversely, when the unemployment rate is above the NAIRU, inflation remains stable or starts decreasing. Note that the relationship may well be *non-linear*: maybe for an unemployment rate above the NAIRU, even significantly above, inflation is stable, but as soon as the unemployment rate falls below the NAIRU, inflation will start accelerating. Estimating the NAIRU is very difficult, precisely because the Phillips curve has become so flat in recent years, as well as the fact that the NAIRU can change over time.

**Why is inflation so low?**

This brings up a question, though: if the unemployment rate is the lowest in about 5 decades, how come inflation is still around 2%? Are we not almost certainly below the NAIRU? There a couple theories that have come up to answer this, but I'll concentrate on one in particular, which was the main reason why I decided to attempt writing this post: the theory that the unemployment rate no longer represents the proper state of the labour market, and other indicators may have become more relevant.

To better understand this theory, a good start is to look at the [labour for participation rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CIVPART). The long rise until the 90s is mostly due to [increasing participation by women in the labour market](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300002), but notice the fall after the recession in 2008. Remember that the unemployment rate is the ratio of unemployed workers *to the civilian labour force*: is it possible that the unemployment rate is low, not because there are few unemployed workers, but because those unemployed workers are classified by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) as being ""out of the labour force"", rather than ""unemployed""?

[According to the BLS](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm#unemployed), a person is counted as ""unemployed"" if: they don't have a job, they are currently available for work (not sick, at school, etc.), *and* have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks. So, it's possible that some of those workers who got laid off during the Great Recession simply feel they have no chance of getting a job and are not actively looking, even though they (given the high rate of job openings) they might have a reasonable chance of finding an opportunity if they looked. Those people would be classified as ""out of the labour force"" and would ""disappear"" from the official unemployment rate statistics, so to speak. This could explain the decline in the labour force participation rate, and also the lack of inflation despite the low unemployment rate: employers can still find workers by convincing people out of the labour force to come back and work for them.

**Counterarguments**

Personally, I'm not completely convinced by this explanation, for a couple reasons. To start with, the BLS actually ask people out of the labour force why they are not looking for work. If an individual answers that they simply don't think they would find a job if they looked, and that is the main reason for not actively looking for a job (as opposed to being sick, in school, retired, and so on), they are considered to be ""discourage workers"". And if an individual has been unemployed for less than 12 months or have acively looked for work in the last 12 months, they are considered to be marginally attached (discouraged workers are a subset of marginally attached workers). So, what if, instead of looking at unemployed workers as a percentage of the labour force, we looked at (unemployed workers + discouraged workers) as a percentage of (labour force + discouraged workers)? [Here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U4RATE) is the result: this rate is *also* low relative to its historical average. So discouraged workers can't be the explanation for the declining labour force participation rate. What about marginally attached workers? [No luck](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE) (edit: this rate, U6, also includes workers who work part-time for economic reasons).

The other reason why I'm not convinced by the story about a ""secret"" pool of labour hidden somewhere is that there are other reasons why the labour force participation rate is low, the biggest one being demographics. The U.S. population is getting older, and older individuals are less attached to the labour force than younger individuals. We can see whether this theory makes sense by looking at the [labour force participation rate for individuals 25 to 54 years old](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300060). It's about 2 percentage points away from its peak in the 90s, so it could grow; current civilian noninstitutional population 25 to 54 years old is [126 million](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNU00000060), so boosting the LFPR and assuming all of those workers are employed could increase employment by 2.5 million, or about 2% of the current employment level 25-54 of roughly [100 million](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS12000060). Not bad, but also not as high as some might think. The labour force participation rate of younger workers ([16-19](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300012) and [20-24](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300036)) is also low, although it's not clear how much of that is due to the recession and how much is due to the trend observed since the 1990s (probably correlated with higher college enrolment rates, although I don't have the data on hand). Finally (and despite the current wave of retiring baby boomers), the [labour force participation rate for individuals 55 years and over](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11324230) has barely been affected by the recession, so it's doubtful it could be significantly increased.

So, are labour markets currently tight? I don't think it's possible to decide with certainty one way or the other; personally, I think they are, but there are good arguments on both sides. But hopefully, after reading this, you will be better equipped to think for yourself about this issue.",smalleconomist,t2_1kuf7f,0.97,106,65

>The US will, of course, lose any such dispute in the kangaroo court defined via the TPP's ISDS process. Rather than pay, the anticipated default dynamic will come into play, and THE MINIMUM WAGE LAW WILL BE REPEALED, COMPLETELY, WHETHER IT'S $15/HR OR $7.25/HR.

(LOUDNESS not mine)

That (the US losing) is an assumption without *any* grounding in precedent, considering that the USA has 'never once lost an ISDS case'^2

And, to finish, I point loudly at the following paragraph from the USTR's 'TPP - Overall U.S. Benefits Fact Sheet' document:^3 

>The fully-enforceable labor standards we have won in TPP include the freedom to form unions
and bargain collectively; prohibitions against child labor and forced labor; **requirements for** acceptable conditions of work such as **minimum wage**, hours of work, and safe workplace conditions; and protections against employment discrimination. These enforceable requirements will help our workers compete fairly and reverse a status quo that disadvantages our workers through a race to the bottom on international labor standards.

# The Bad Economics of wtfhappenedin1971

Once in a while, I get asked about the website [wtfhappenedin1971.com][1] (let's call it **wtfh1971**). I first came across it when [Stephen Diehl asked me about it in our interview][2]. But apart from a r/badeconomics [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/sccs74/so_wtf_happened_in_1971/hu64fkd), the website never got the full course debunking I think it deserves. Let's fix that.

**What is this website?**

In 75 annotated charts, wtfh1971 unsubtly tries to convince you that [end of the Bretton Woods system][4] broke society. Then, of course, wtfh1971 shills bitcoin.

In 1971, you see, the US dollar stopped being convertible to gold. This is why... uh... people started divorcing more? I'm not joking, [that argument gets made:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_0977.jpg)

**An aside on the divorce rate**

Let's knock this one out of the way now: despite what people at the [mises institute][5] would have you think, not a lot of couples divorce because of bitter arguments on the convertibility of the dollar to gold.

The divorce rate increase since 1960 is related to the [no-fault divorce laws passing in the US][6] Before that, if a couple went to a court and said ""we hate each other, grant us a divorce, please"" the judge could legally say ""fuck you, you're still married, work it out"".

**Debunking wtfh1971**

Debunking Wtfh1971 is an unfair game. The website is the perfect example of the [bullshit asymmetry principle][7]. All wtfh1971 has to do is find a chart and put an arrow on it with MS paint, while I'm left explaining everything from why inequality is increasing, to how inflation works, to, apparently, the divorce rate.

Because of this, I'll separate the mistakes wtfh1971 is making into categories, and debunk those.

We've seen on here before [how a fixed money supply system like a gold standard or a bitcoin standard is a bad idea][8]. I didn't cover the obvious link to the divorce rate, but nonetheless maybe go read that because I'll try not to repeat myself too much.

# Theme 1: Productivity vs wages

The first kind of graph in wtfh1971 implies the decoupling between GDP growth and labor income happened in 1971. You see this in the first 10 graphs, [like this one:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_0540-1_arrow.jpg)

This is starting on the wrong foot. The idea that 1971 had anything to do with the productivity-wage divergence is a stretch because even [the EPI who made that graph put the divergence at 1978][9]:

[(chart)](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-9.47.36-PM.jpg)

In any case, it's worth discussing the productivity-wage divergence. *Productivity* is GDP divided by hours worked in the economy. *Wage* is the money you get in your paycheque. *Compensation* is wages + benefits (insurance, etc.).

There are several things going on at once in the wage-productivity divergence chart, so we need to unpack some labor economics.

### Compensation vs Wage

Some charts compare wage growth instead of compensation growth. Tracking wage growth over many decades [is a mistake in the USA.][10]

This is because [US Healthcare costs have grown at a ridiculous rate][11]. US Healthcare is paid through insurance. That insurance is tied to employment income because of an [idiotic tax deduction][12]. It's well known that [increases in healthcare costs are directly removed from wages][13].

So if you measure wage growth in the USA, it'll seem slow because wages are getting eaten up by health insurance.

The EPI isn't making this mistake, but other wtfh1971 [chart make this specific mistake:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-11.26.04-PM-1.jpg)

The ""relentless 50 year decline in wages"" should be labelled the ""relentless 50 year increase in healthcare costs"".

### Median vs Average Wage

Notice that **the EPI chart is plotting median compensation**. As we saw in the post on [the effect of automation on the labor market][14], wage inequality has been increasing. This means [the gap between the average wage and the median wage has been widening][15]:

[(chart here)](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-10.13.16-PM.jpg)

A leading theory says this gap started accelerating around the 1980s because of [skill-biased technological change][16]. Basically: new technology like computers is more empowering for those that are already well paid. This means well paid workers have increasing wages, while lower paid workers, especially in manual labor, have stagnant wages.

There are other trends suppressing wage growth at the bottom of the wage distribution. As noted by [Brookings:][17]

> the deteriorating value of the inflation-adjusted minimum wage, along with declining union membership, have lowered wages for many in the bottom and middle of the wage distribution.

Measuring median wage growth is indirectly measuring inequality growth, rather than actual wage growth over time.

### Nerdy measurement stuff

If you measure an economic trend over 50 years, chances are the number you're looking at is picking up all sorts of other trends along the way.

Terry Fitzgerald's paper [""where has all the income gone?""][18] shows that the divergence in household compensation growth can be explained in large part by measurement issues.

First, simply using a different measure of inflation (PCE vs CPI) will change the income growth measured by 8%.

Then, the change in household composition explains much of household income divergence. Married couples make more than singles, but there's fewer married couples since 1960. [Take this chart from Fitzgerald:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Chart5-large.jpg)

Fitzgerald explains:

> This result seems like a mathematical contradiction: How can all subgroups grow faster than the entire group? But there is no contradiction. The explanation lies in the changing household mix. Married-couple households have much higher incomes than other household types, and there has been a large decline in married-couple households. This decline depresses overall median income growth.

Uh, maybe wtfh1971 was right that the divorce rate has something to do with it?

### The gold standard has nothing to do with any of this

A lot of charts on wth1971 are based in misunderstanding the evolution of the labor market since 1980. First, remember **wage stagnation is, to some extent, real**. Mostly for the lower wage jobs. But the general date economists pick to date the start of the divergence is somewhere in the 1980s, not 1971. Let's helpfully [re-annotate the wtfh1971 charts:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-10.58.20-PM.jpg)

Stopping the conversion of the US dollar to gold didn't help invent computers or lead to exploding healthcare costs.

# Theme 2: Inflation Illiteracy

Another common one is charts just showing that wtfh1971 doesn't know what **""adjusting for inflation""** means. Here [is an example:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-11.35.11-PM.jpg)

The chart just shows that inflation is a thing that exists.

As we've seen in the post on [bitcoin/gold vs fiat money][8], low inflation isn't bad. Having stable inflation at 2% is pretty great, actually.

What's bad is deflation and especially **high volatility in inflation**. If you don't know if inflation next year will be 1% or 9%, the uncertainty will make you skeptical to finance long projects.

The 1971 switch to a floating currency permitted the period of low/stable inflation from [1980-onwards:](https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png)

Now compare this to [this plot from wtfh1971:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/10-year-bond-yield.jpg)

This **is not inflation adjusted data!** The wtfh1971 chart plots inflation rate and nothing else. Notice it tracks the 1965-2020 inflation rate from the chart above perfectly.

# Theme 3: House prices

Another common one is house prices. Take [this chart from wtfh1971:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/efkgav8wwaenvoc.png)

Apart from the fact that the trend starts in 1980 again, it's clear housing prices have diverged from wages.

Covering why house prices went crazy merits its own post, but we can agree that, like healthcare and college costs, housing prices in metropolitan areas have grown out of control. This has to do with some factors:

*   **People want to live in cities**. From 1950 to 2010, the number of US people living in [cities went from 50% to 80%:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Urban_and_rural_populations_in_the_United_States_US_Census_Bureau_1790_to_2010_OWID.svg_.png)

This means there's a lot more pressure in the housing markets of some particular metro areas. [People live in cities][19]. No one is complaining about housing prices in places people are not moving to. [Housing price growth is not evenly distributed][20]:

[(chart here)](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-13-at-8.56.29-AM.jpg)

*   **We aren't building enough houses in cities**. This is a discussion for another day, but in the cities people are moving to, we aren't building houses. This is especially due to NIMBY issues like [zoning & permitting][21]. Note that the paper I just linked is from 2002! Zoning being bad for housing prices should not be news to anyone.

Also, how taxation is implemented affects prices and construction. Repeat the holy prayer: There is no tax but the Land Value Tax, and Henry George is the last prophet. A good example of this is San Francisco, which has [been building fewer housing over time:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bay-Area-Housing-Units-Authorized_since-1967.jpg)

It should be a surprise to no one that a city which isn't building new housing units, but where people move to, the housing prices will increase.

*   **Measurement issues (again)**. As we saw, there's fewer married couples since 1960. Since people aren't living together, this means there's an increased need for *housing unit per population*. 

Also, we're not building the same houses we were in the 1970s. Much like the divorce rate affects measurement of wages, the kind of house being built affects measurement of home prices. We're building [larger houses over time, for fewer people:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/housing1.png)

One reason house prices seem so bad is that we're building bigger houses for fewer married couples. This is partly because the permitting and inspection process is much easier for a single family house than for a [5-over-1][22]. That said, the [price per square feet has been increasing nonetheless][23].

### Maybe they have a point here?

The interest rate has a large effect on the housing market.

We know housing construction is tied to the interest rate. Since construction has to be financed on a loan, there should be more construction when rates are lower. Of course that won't happen if home builders are bankrupt (see: 2008-2013) or if you're simply not allowed to build stuff (see: NYC, SF, LA, Toronto, Vancouver, etc.)

Housing price is also tied to the interest rate. People buy houses with a 25 or 30 year mortgage, and if the interest rate is lower, they can afford a more expensive house.

If the housing market was healthy, these factors might balance out. But metro areas are in a housing shortage. If you go back to my post on [bargaining power in the housing market][24], you'll remember that if there's a housing shortage, housing prices will follow the maximum price one can afford.

In that case, lowering interest rates means that for the same mortgage payment, people can afford a more expensive house. This means lower interest rates would increase housing prices, and transfer wealth from non-homeowners to homeowners.

Low interest rates increase speculative behaviour, because they let people gamble on financial outcomes over longer time horizons. A recent example is the cryptocurrency mania of 2021-2022, and how it effectively stopped when the federal [reserve increased interest rates.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-13-at-10.07.05-AM.jpg)

The housing mania in the early 2000s [was related to ""exuberant expectations""][25] - it's plausible that the low interest rates during that period accelerated housing price growth.

Now, remember that the interest rate has steadily decreased since the dollar [has become floating:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-13-at-12.16.39-AM.jpg)

It's entirely possible that over 5 decades, the interest rate going down has increased housing prices in areas with a housing shortage.

Houses are the one particular thing people finance over very long periods of time in their lives. It's not hard to conceive that low interest rates act as a long term wealth transfer from people who own the scarce thing to people who buy the scarce thing with a huge loan.

By the way: even if this were true, it wouldn't mean the solution to housing prices is to be found in messing with the interest rate. That's a bad idea. Increasing the interest rate to lower house prices would mess up all sorts of other variables in the economy (unemployment rate, inflation, etc.).

The solution to housing prices is to **build more fucking houses**.

# Theme 4: Autism causes Vaccines

The last, huge class of charts is ""numbers are generally going up"". Because lots of numbers have been going up since 1971, you can correlate anything you want if you don't do proper statistics.

A classic in the ""numbers go up so they're causing each other"" field of study is Andrew Wakefield's 1999 article that [claims the MMR vaccine causes autism][26]. Here's [the key chart in the article:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-13-at-10.20.56-AM.jpg)

Notice a few things:

1.  This is the original full resolution picture. The Lancet accepts absolute garbage quality plots, apparently.

2.  Putting arrows on charts and inferring causality is an analytic technique Andrew Wakefield and wfth1971 have in common

Again, a lot of things have been going up since 1970. Autism diagnosis, vaccination, cell phone usage, cancer diagnosis, whatever. We could also claim that [cancer diagnosis causes cell phones:][27]

[(chart here)](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cell_phones.png)

Whatever, go buy bitcoin, I'm pretty sure it solves all of this.

521,k0pb4d,2020-11-25,badeconomics,"I am, once again, asking libertarians to learn some ""basic economic theory""","So David Seymour, leader of the ACT Party, a libertarian party in New Zealand has said [some dumb things](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/11/labour-s-proposed-minimum-wage-increase-an-act-of-economic-vandalism-act-leader-david-seymour.html?fbclid=IwAR1hDkR4MIgFTfsthcDt2lIp84toe3D6WVGXdaAjWHhIGeAzljqxOhmGvXU) recently regarding the minimum wage. The key comments I’d like to focus on are the following: 

> Basic economic theory and empirical evidence show minimum wage increases would only serve to reduce the number of jobs available

> Seymour argues that if he's wrong - if minimum wages don't reduce the number of jobs available, and we can ""legislate our way to greater prosperity"" - left-wing groups should be advocating for a much higher minimum wage.

> ""Labour and the Helen Clark Foundation claim there's no cost to raising the minimum wage and that we can boost productivity and grow the economy by passing new laws,"" he said.

> ""If that's the case, why not advocate for a minimum wage of $50 an hour?""

Now, before we get into this, a few caveats are in order:

* I’m not claiming to know what the “right” level of minimum wage is, or suggesting that this specific increase in minimum wage cannot cause unemployment. I’d just like to explain why the “basic economic theory suggests…” argument doesn’t really work here, and explain why there’s nothing inconsistent with supporting a higher minimum wage, without taking it all the way to the extreme.
* Yes, mono means one. I am aware there is more than one employer out there. The reason why I’m choosing to use the monopsonistic case of labour markets is because it’s simpler, and even when we move onto oligopsonistic labour markets, the results are still similar. While there are some differences between each case, the key points I’d like to make are a result of firms having *some* degree of market power, rather than coming from the exact number of firms we have.

So, with that out of the way, we can crack into it. Now, if we were living in a world where labour markets were perfectly competitive, then raising the minimum wage past the equilibrium wage would unambiguously cause an increase in unemployment. However, if we consider a monopsonistic labour market, the picture is not so clear cut.

#**So, what is a monopsonistic labour market?**

Simply put, a monopsonistic labour market refers to the scenario in which there is one (after all, mono means one) firm who demands labour, and many perfect substitutes who supply it, for the prevailing wage.

#**So, how do monopsonistic labour markets differ from perfectly competitive ones?**

There are two key points I’d like to touch on here. 

*1.* First and foremost, there’s a large difference in the degree to which each agent can bargain between the two scenarios. Consider an example where I run a café, and am considering hiring an additional barista. I know that employing them will increase my revenue by $15 (which I’ll refer to as the marginal revenue product of labour, or MRPL), but I’m only offering a wage of $10 per hour. 

If there are an abundance of similar cafés around, which would experience the same increase in revenue as a result of hiring this person as I would, they would be willing to pay up to $15 per hour to hire them. So, when receiving my offer, this person’s options are (a) Accept the offer (unlikely, given there are people out there willing to pay them more for the same job), (b) Reject the offer, and go work for one of my competitors (slightly more likely, as they’re willing to pay them more for the same job), or (c) Reject the offer, and choose to sit at home instead (once again, slightly more likely than them accepting the job). If I want to hire this person, I’m going to have to pay the $15 that their labour generates for me, or somebody else will.
Now, suppose I’m the only employer in town. Suddenly, the only two options are (a) Accept the offer, or (b) Reject the offer, and choose to sit at home instead.

So the key import is this: Competition can bid the wage up to the MRPL. When there’s a lack of competition, firms still have to compete with the worker’s option of exiting the labour force, but without competing for workers with other firms, they can get away with paying slightly less than the MRPL. This mark-up they make on the MRPL (which is equal to MRPL – wage) results in profits for the firm.

*2.* Related to the last point on what competition does to the prevailing wage, in the case of perfect competition, firms act as price takers. Workers have a given MRPL, and firms must pay this amount if they want to attract workers. Therefore, when hiring an additional worker, the wage they pay them is the marginal cost of labour (which is important, as we know that firms maximise profits when MR = MC)

It’s slightly different in the case of a monopsonistic firm. Thinking back to the case of a monopoly covered in Econ 101 (which some would call basic economic theory), we saw they were price makers, in that their output decisions influenced the market price. If a monopolist was unable to engage in perfect price discrimination, selling an additional unit typically entailed them having to lower the price not just on that unit, but the ones they sold before that. Therefore, their marginal revenue is the price they sold an extra unit for, minus the revenue they lost out on when dropping the price on previous units sold. So what do we see on the flip side of that, when we have only one buyer? Pretty much the same thing. As the firm faces an upward sloping labour supply curve, when making decisions around how much labour to hire, they must account for the fact that in order to hire an additional worker, they must increase the wage they're offering to that employee, as well as the previous ones. Their marginal cost of labour is therefore the wage paid to the additional employee, plus the increase in wages now paid to other employees. As this results in a higher marginal cost of labour than in the case of a price taker, we see that the MC curve intersects the MR curve (the point at which they maximise profit, thus stop purchasing labour) much earlier than in the perfectly competitive case. In other words **firms with market power restrict their input or output, due to the impact they have on the market price.** Therefore, it’s not unreasonable to suggest that a price control which brings the price closer to the marginal cost (in a monopolies case) or marginal revenue (in a monopsonists case) may counteract this to some degree, increasing the equilibrium quantity.

#**So, what happens when we increase the minimum wage?**

To answer this question, it is perhaps easiest to draw a [graph.](https://imgur.com/2QpQIJS) We’ll let the y-axis represent the wage, and the x-axis represent the quantity of labour transacted. As mentioned before, the labour supply curve slopes upwards. After all, the firm must compete with the workers’ option to sit at home and do nothing, so in order to hire more of them, they must increase the wage. As the marginal cost of labour exceeds the wage, the marginal cost of labour curve lies above the supply curve. I don’t think it needs to be, but I’ve made the MRPL curve downward sloping. Now, the MRPL curve intersects the MCL curve at point A, so the amount of labour they wish to employ is given by L1. Looking to the point where this intersects the labour supply curve, they only need to pay a wage w1 to achieve this.

Now, what happens if we set a minimum wage, say w2? Well, it changes the marginal cost of labour. Refer to the new [graph.](https://imgur.com/sFqTZ7V) Up until point B in this new graph, a firm can hire an additional worker at the new minimum wage, while continuing to employee previous employees at the minimum wage (as it sits above the labour supply curve). So, the MCL curve is flat until it intersects the labour supply curve, at which point they must begin to pay above the minimum wage to entice new employees to work for them, where the MCL curve jumps up to where it sat prior to the increase in the minimum wage, giving us the curve MCL2. We see the new MCL curve intersects the MRPL curve at point C, so the firm will hire L2, at wage w2. In contrast with the first graph, we see that employment has actually increased, as has the prevailing wage. From the firm’s perspective, they were making some mark-up over employees’ MRPL, resulting in a profit for the firm. At the new minimum wage, *it still remains profitable to employee these people, just slightly less so*, hence they won't cut back on their hiring. The minimum wage has taken some of the firm’s profits, and distributed them to the employees.

As mentioned before, setting the price to be more closely aligned with the MRPL can counteract the effect of price-makers restricting their input decisions, and increase the total quantity in equilibrium. So, basic economic theory does not suggest that minimum wages always increase unemployment, in contrast with what David Seymour seems to believe.

#**So, why not an \*insert arbitrarily high number here\* minimum wage?**

As an example, we could look at a [graph.](https://imgur.com/Wh8kI5m) like this, where the minimum wage is set to w3, far above the MRPL for any given quantity. The resulting MCL curve is given by MCL3. Notice the as MCL > MRPL for any given L, it would cost the firm more to hire an additional worker than the revenue they would generate. As a result, any profit maximising firm would simply hire L = 0.

#**So, what have we learned?**

Well, it turns out that economic theory says that the impact of an increase in the minimum wage on employment is a little ambiguous. It depends on the degree of market power that firms have in the labour market, the MRPL, and where the equilibrium wage sits relative to the MRPL. The key to price controls not reducing output / input is that they must be closely aligned with the marginal cost / marginal revenue. So, if you’re hoping to increase incomes for people on minimum wage, it may make sense to increase the minimum wage to a certain level, but not take it to an arbitrarily high extreme.

[The OP.](https://i.redd.it/boiyuou5k9sx.jpg)

This post posits the thesis ""if you want more women to be in the STEM fields, and you yourself choose to go into some different field, then you have no right to make the claim."" Firstly the logic of the post is absurd because even if that women *had* entered into the stem field it isn't as if that would have a difference in the statistics and additionally whether or not she elected to go into STEM doesn't discount her normative claim about the way the world should be. 

Even discounting the OP's poor logic the OP is still wrong because he fails to address that one of the biggest problems facing women entering the STEM fields is the significant barriers to entry. It is clear, firstly, that there is a rather sever gap in the sheer number of men vs women in STEM "" In 2011, 26 percent of STEM workers were women and 74 percent were men."" ([Page 5](https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acs-24.pdf)). Secondly while the actual causes of the STEM gap are unclear, but [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1964782) is and [here](https://www.aauw.org/files/2013/02/Why-So-Few-Women-in-Science-Technology-Engineering-and-Mathematics.pdf) are broadly theorized to be because societal expectations, lack of role models and/or lack of ability to have children, it is clear that as a society we are biasing the STEM fields towards males broadly. To pull anecdotal evidence I went to a STEM public highschool and the gender ratio was roughly 70/30 (much to my chagrin). 

Regardless, it is clear that the reason women are not in STEM fields as much as men cannot simply be hand waved away by claiming it is simple because of the individual preferences of women that they aren't represented.

Now were getting into the *real* misogamy. 

Firstly let's preform some really unsophisticated analysis on the claim that women aren't smart enough. I don't see how that could remotly be true considering the IQ differences between men and women [aren't that diffrent](http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/Images/Sex%20differences%20on%20the%20WISC.jpg), the math SAT scores of men and women [aren't that different](https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/blogs/95726/2014/03/146332-148516.jpg?itok=lHtSbI-h), and even the GRE scores [aren't that fucking different

The more sophisticated response basically comes from the sources about, [I think this is the best](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1964782), but to reiterate the problem is not that women can't do the work for a stem degree the problem is with society and the way we treat women or tell them what they can or cannot do.

*I really need to get a better hobby.*

**V. Introduction to Part II:**

>*“And yet there lie in his hoards many records that few even of the lore-masters now can read, for their scripts and tongues have become dark to later men.”*  
\- **Gandalf**

Welcome back to [*making the internet very mad at me, part 2*](https://youtu.be/DnqHONJMoww) *(née* Why Hasn’t Middle Earth Had an Industrial Revolution?) where we explore why Middle Earth should or should not have had an Industrial Revolution.^(1)

In the [last part](https://featherlessbipeds.substack.com/p/why-didnt-gandalf-own-a-colt-45), while we mainly covered natural resources, we briefly discussed how scientific knowledge was probably not *sufficient* for the Industrial Revolution. The large lag times between the discovery of relevant scientific facts (for instance, the discovery that nature allows for vacuums) and the adaptation of those facts into inventions like the steam engine suggest that more things than just science were at play.^(2) Today, I want to look slightly more in depth at scientific discovery because, while it may not have been sufficient for development, it does seem *necessary*. 

But, before we can dive into that:

**VI. We need to talk about Isengard (and also Mordor I guess)**

>***“****But I don’t want to cure cancer, I want to turn people into dinosaurs”*  
\-**Sauron**^(3)

*“But what about Mordor!”, “You clearly didn’t think about the fact that Sauron is an allegory for industrialization”, “actually, Isengard was industrializing…”* 

A lot of people seem to think that I have made a fundamental mistake and that Middle Earth actually *is* industrializing and so my question is poorly put; I don’t think this is right. 

First of all, even granting the idea that both Mordor and Isengard are industrializing, that doesn’t actually respond to the question *“Why hasn’t Middle Earth had an Industrial Revolution?”*

Fundamentally, the question is about *why* they have or have not had one instead of *if* they have or have not, but I also generally don’t think any current industrialization is that relevant. Like, imagine a divorcee who buys his ex-wife flowers on what would have been their 25th anniversary. The ex-wife is being totally reasonable when she asks *“Why didn’t you do this 15 years ago”* and we don’t think a good response is *“Well, um… actually I’m doing it now, so your question is poorly phrased.”* The point is that you didn’t do something when you should have! Similarly, the defense that some sort of Industrial Revolution is happening on Middle Earth doesn’t really explain why it didn’t before. 

A second problem is, while I will concede entirely that Tolkien clearly intended the evil locations in LOTR to *represent*the Industrial Revolution, they don’t actually seem to be industrializing.^(4) Most people who pointed this out quoted passages noting the widespread deforestation and smog being loosed into the sky.^(5) The problem with this is that these are *potential effects* of industrialization but not actually direct evidence of it. To give you another tortured metaphor, It’s a bit like seeing someone unmoving and covered in a red viscous liquid and concluding a gruesome murder happened. Like it’s possible it was a murder, but it could also be someone having a nap after a hotdog eating contest. 

Let’s start with Isengard. Sure, they are burning a bunch of trees, but that’s not actually proof of industrialization. Last week we discussed that coal was relatively cheap compared to wood in England. The reason for that was that London had deforested most of the area around it *before* the IR!^(6) For all we know, Sarumon just really hates trees. More reasonably, it might be that the trees are being used as fuel in an extensive increase of non-industrial processes.

That is, Sarumon needs to equip an incredibly large army with armor, weaponry, and all sorts of other equipment. To do that he needs fuel for furnaces and forges as well as wood for use as a material. This is pretty explicit in the text, in Isengard *“The shafts ran down by many slopes and spiral stairs to caverns far under; there Saruman had treasuries, store-houses, armouries, smithies, and great furnaces. Iron wheels revolved there endlessly, and hammers thudded.”*^(7)

Sure, at first glance this sounds *industrial,* but furnaces and forges weren’t new technologies in the industrial revolution. Here’s a list of patents for new technologies in Britain broken down by sector during the IR^(8): [https://imgur.com/a/qMRPIkg](https://imgur.com/a/qMRPIkg)

Note how the vast majority of innovations aren’t in mining or smelting (and apparently a lot of the metallurgy patents listed here were actually about plating and tinning).^(9) Furthermore, it’s not like we have textual evidence that Sarumon is actually getting *better* at producing metal stuff, just that he is producing *more* of it. For all we know, all Sarumon is doing is utilizatizing a great deal more of existing technology rather than actually creating something new. The IR was not just a change in quantity of production, it was a change in quality and kind. There doesn’t seem to be great evidence of that here.

Of course, here are a couple of hints that maybe some mechanization or technological innovation is occurring. Sarumon is described as “a mind of metal and wheels; and he does not care for growing things,” and during the march of the ents on Isengard “he set some of his precious machinery to work.”.^(10) But this is really scant evidence to say that Isengard is industrial. That “precious machinery” is described to us by hobbits unfamiliar with the area and is really just opening the furnace vents to let out heat, not exactly the most innovative thing ever. What these ornate and complicated mechanisms seem like to me is a dictator inefficiently directing the labor of the society he controls towards complicated works with existing technology, not the product of an innovative society with high technological capacity.

Similarly, Sarumon’s takeover of the Shire at the end of LOTR is not really a great example of industrialization. When the Hobbits return to the Shire, they find that the has been a coup that overthrew the prior government and instituted an autocratic kleptocracy with Sarumon at the head.^(11) The main point people make when they claim that this is industrialization is that the new government knocked down the old mill and replaced it with a larger one “full o’ wheels and outlandish contraptions” that is polluting the river. This is, I think, slightly better evidence of industrialization. 

Using water mills to provide a source of power definitely was a part of the industrial revolution.^(12) But, if you read carefully, this mill is explicitly described as still only being used to grind corn.^(13) That is, this mill is just a better version of what mills were used for in Britain since at least Roman Occupation!^(14) Perhaps it portends the oncoming harnessing of power for various mechanical purposes, but it definitely isn’t evidence of mechanical transformation itself.

As for Mordor proper, I think the evidence is even worse here. Sure, we get descriptions of lots of forges and furnaces, but, again, this isn’t industrialization.^(15) Repeat after me, it isn’t industrialization unless it involves the development of new mechanized technologies, otherwise it’s just sparkling pollution. 

So, I swear to like Eru Illuvatar or whatever, if even one of you nerds decides to write a 22 page thesis in the comments about Mordor being industrial again I will come to your house and break all of your funko pops.

**VII. Science and Culture**

>*Of their original home the Hobbits in Bilbo’s time preserved no knowledge. A love of learning (other than genealogical lore) was far from general among them, but there remained still a few in the older families who studied their own books, and even gathered reports of old times and distant lands from Elves, Dwarves, and Men.*  
**- The Red Book of Westmarch**

So, anyway, science.

When I say science was necessary for the Industrial Revolution, I really mean something like “the product of science was necessary for creation of the various technological inventions and improvements that occurred during the Industrial Revolution”. What was the product of science? To hear Joel Mokyr tell it: *useful propositional knowledge.* 

What does that mean? Essentially, facts. Scientific investigation produces clear, concrete, and (largely) correct pieces of information like “The melting point of steel is X”, “Nitrogen improves crop yields”, or “The Beatles are overrated”. Inventors in turn take these bits of knowledge and can combine and innovate with them to produce technology.^(16) To return to a frequent example, the facts surrounding the properties of pressure were critical for the development of the steam engine. Without these various bits of discrete knowledge, it’s really hard, if not impossible, to make innovations. 

This is really a multi-step process that is worth breaking down into pieces: [https://imgur.com/a/PZJbWXt](https://imgur.com/a/PZJbWXt)

Here’s an example of how this process might go. Let’s say I’m a research scientist and I discover after rigorous empirical testing that, as a matter of physics, Tolkien fans are magnetically repulsive to members of their romantically preferred gender. I take my results and write them up in a journal article using standardized notation and practices for communicating facts. That journal article is then read by someone else who uses this previously unknown fact to create the world's first human-driven electromagnetic generator, singlehandedly solving the energy crisis and stopping climate change in its tracks. Each of those steps from discovery to the encoding of the fact being read by the inventor is necessary for a new invention to be made.

The Mokyrian explanation for the Industrial Revolution is, basically, that in the immediate run up to the time period, each step in this process became easier and occurred more, creating a much larger knowledge base than would have been present otherwise and allowing for new inventions and innovations to flourish.^(17)

What caused this change? The Enlightenment. 

More specifically: the Baconian program. Mokyr has spent a large part of his career documenting how, immediately prior to the enlightenment, there was a fundamental shift away from the neo-Aristotelian Thomist synthesis of the Medieval system towards a new empiricist approach to physics and science.^(18) 

The “Baconian Program” termed after Lord Francis Bacon, was, simplifying a bit, a (partially uncoordinated) attempt to generate a large body of general principles based on empirical regularities.^(19) For instance, Newtonian mechanics may be thought of as one of the largest contributions of “the program” in as far as it was a proposed set of regularities based on the observed instances of apples falling off of trees or whatever. This resulted in a much larger body of useful knowledge to draw on for invention.

It wasn’t just that there were more facts, they were also more accessible. There was an increased willingness to make research public and to do so in a regular manner (by standardizing things like notation and measurements).^(20) Furthermore, there was an attempt to increase distribution of these facts through the regular publications of scientific journals as well as large anthologies of scientific information (most famously Diderot and D’Alembert’s *Encyclopédie).*^(21) The result of this was that scientific knowledge was more available than ever.

Of course, this just seems like we’ve punted our explanation of the industrial revolution back one step. If enlightenment scientific advancement caused industrialization, what caused the enlightenment? Continuing with Mokyr’s explanation, the answer is culture.^(22) Specifically, the driver of this change in approach towards understanding the world was a newfound belief (among elites) that economic and technological change was both possible and desirable. 

This attitude drove increased amounts of attention and resources to scientific progress (directly as more people wanted to engage with science and indirectly as status rewards incentivized scientific discovery and patronage of scientists). 

So, to spell out the process being proposed here entirely, it goes:

**Culture** → **Science** → **Invention** → **Economic Growth**

We have pretty decent qualitative evidence of a cultural shift towards science. We also have excellent evidence of an increase in scientific discovery. We can even see the increase in science quantitatively.^(23)

There was an increase in scientific journals:

[https://imgur.com/a/pn7LQZw](https://imgur.com/a/pn7LQZw)

[https://imgur.com/a/4GfQ2Yd](https://imgur.com/a/4GfQ2Yd)

As well as scientific societies:

[https://imgur.com/a/FRJzBZh](https://imgur.com/a/FRJzBZh)

So there’s at least some evidence that Culture → Science. 

What about Science → Innovation? Here, I think the evidence is more mixed. 

To remind you what the causal mechanism is that was being proposed, it’s that scientific elites discover new knowledge which then trickles down to artisans and fabricants who then use that knowledge combined with their skill to create new inventions. So, first of all, we need evidence that artisans could actually access the new science that was being created.

Van Zaden (2009) provides us some evidence of this by looking at books over time Europe and finding that they became cheaper and more available.^(24)

[https://imgur.com/a/cxwsv6Z](https://imgur.com/a/cxwsv6Z)

[https://imgur.com/a/PTuF2kp](https://imgur.com/a/PTuF2kp)

Books were more accessible *and* more people were capable of reading them:

[https://imgur.com/a/XAXX9Eq](https://imgur.com/a/XAXX9Eq)

So that’s pretty good evidence that scientific knowledge would have been more available than ever. What’s the issue?

A couple of things. First, the Enlightenment was a European wide phenomena, but industrialization began specifically in England. If it was a large driver, then why didn’t other countries take off at the same time?^(25) I don’t think this is too big a worry for us specifically, as we are only thinking of science as a necessary condition rather than the sole driver, so we can allow that Britain had unique factors that drove early industrialization.

The second problem is that the evidence that inventors of new technology during the IR actually used scientific knowledge is simply mixed. That is, even if scientific knowledge was available, it may not have been used frequently during invention. Instead, some research suggests that innovation was a more isolated phenomenon generated mainly by ‘tinkering’ or trial and error until a successful device emerged rather than being constructed in accordance with predictions made by science. For instance, “Less than one-fourth of those had any schooling other than an apprenticeship”.^(26) It’s simply hard to see how to square the low rates of education with the idea of science as a driver.

But, of course, not having a formal education is not quite the same thing as not having access to science. Where does that leave us? I think, basically, we are in a similar spot to the Factor Price theory, where there is credible evidence both for and against, but the immense plausibility of the theory demands we at least treat it seriously.

**VIII. Do Elves go to School?**

>*It is told that in their beginning the Dwarves were made by Aulë in the darkness of Middle-earth; for so greatly did Aulë desire the coming of the Children, to have learners to whom he could teach his lore and his crafts, that he was unwilling to await the fulfilment of the designs of Ilúvatar.*  
**-The Silmarillion**

So, how does this story of Culture -> Science -> Invention -> Economic Growth fit in with Middle Earth?

Frankly, Middle Earth’s level of scientific innovation is abysmal. There are a few groups mentioned in the books (which again, I have not read) that we could think of as dealing with the sorts of academic inquiry we are interested in: the archives of Minas Tirith, the elven school of Lambengolmor*,* and, of course, the council of five Wizards. These all turn out to be incredibly backwards institutions with little interest in discovery or exploration of natural science.

Let’s start with the Archives. We are told that the collection in Minas Tirith has a vast collection of “hoarded scrolls and books.” and that at least a fair amount of staff are employed in maintaining and interpreting the collection. Indeed, when Gandalf is seeking knowledge about the one ring this is the first place he seeks out, suggesting it is a location of at least decent renown. But this is also a fundamentally backwards institution, in the words of Denethor *“If indeed you look only, as you say, for records of ancient days, and the beginnings of the City, read on!’*’ he said. *‘‘For to me what was is less dark than what is to come, and that is my care.”*. This suggests that the archives primarily serve as a repository for the wisdom of the ancients rather than as an active research institution dedicated to furthering current knowledge. And the archives are even bad at their job of maintaining existing facts! Gandalf tells us that *“And yet there lie in his hoards many records that few even of the lore-masters now can read, for their scripts and tongues have become dark to later men.”* The most extreme example of this is that a scroll that tells you how to identify the one ring, basically the Middle Earth equivalent of detailed instruction on how to build a nuclear bomb, has just been sitting around unread by anyone in the basement for centuries! This is not the sort of place we should expect productive science from.

What about the Elves? The best reference I could find to any sort of organization dedicated to knowledge gathering is yet another backwards looking collection of loremasters. The school of Lambengolmor, which is primarily composed of linguists and historians, seems to be the clearest example of an Elven institution dedicated to discovery of facts or wisdom. Notably absent is any sense of forward looking discovery, with instead a focus on compiling facts about what happened.

And so we come to the Order of the Wizards. For those who (like me) have not read the books you need to understand that while wizards in Middle Earth may appear to be a friendly collection of doddering old wise men, they are, in fact, an elite strike force of angels sent by lesser gods to prepare Middle Earth for war with Sauron.

As such, I’m not too surprised that we don’t get any direct evidence that they themselves are engaging in scientific research, but it is somewhat surprising that they don’t seem to even encourage it? After all, surely with the heavy emphasis on how Sauron is tooling up Mordor for war it would have been helpful to, say, spend some of the last 1000 years helping the Free Kingdoms learn how to make better steel or something? Alas, the Wizards seem to have a fairly anti-inquiry bent with Gandalf notably telling a (fallen) Sarumon that *“he that breaks a thing* ***to find out what it is*** *has left the path of wisdom.”.* This is in reference to Sarumon making a discovery about optics that white light can be split into multiple colors. Your basic platitudes are standing in the way of the invention of glasses, Gandalf! So, no scientific discovery or encouragement is coming from here.

I think these bits of evidence combine to paint a picture of a society that is fairly backwards looking with a culture that emphasizes holding on to the teachings of the ancients over new discovery. So, the low level of discovery seems to make sense given the cultural values of the Middle Earth. 

But, when interrogating the world building, I think we can go one step deeper and ask if this sort of backwards looking culture makes sense.

To do this we need a model of culture change. 

To start with, let’s think of society as consisting of a complex network of nodes.^(27)

[https://imgur.com/a/ljQNCeJ](https://imgur.com/a/ljQNCeJ)

Where each node represents a person and each line is a social connection between those people. Now let’s assume that each person has a set of beliefs, values, and preferences that we can group under the general banner of culture. 

For any given cultural item that someone has, we think there is a chance that they transmit it to someone else. So, in our model, if Frodo comes up with a new cultural idea, say “We should form a group in charge of geothermal-powered jewelry recycling.” then there is a chance that people exposed to the new belief (i.e. connected to Frodo) will choose to adopt it. If they do, the process repeats for those people’s connections and so on. 

There are a few factors that we might think make it more or less likely for beliefs to be spread. First, it’s not like all cultural properties are equally likely to be adopted. Think about it in real life, just because you tangentially know somebody who thinks that the Pentagon is actually just a really low polygon flying saucer doesn’t mean you are going to start thinking that. Various things bias upwards or downwards the probability of a cultural norm being adopted. For instance, for beliefs that clearly do not comport with observed facts we might expect some resistance to adoption. 

The second thing that might determine culture spread and change is the size and density of the societal network. Ideas can be adopted in two ways. First, they can be picked up from someone in the network. Second, someone within the network can be a *cultural innovator* who sua sponte comes up with something new. The more people you have in the network, the more likely you are to see the introduction of new ideas. Similarly, connecting previously unconnected networks allows for access to previously unavailable ideas. Furthermore, we should pay attention to the *density* of the network. That is, for any given node how many others is it connected to. This density of connection allows for much faster spread and prevents novel ideas from getting “gated” where all of the connections to the novel idea connect it and it therefore never gets a chance to spread. 

As an example here, the development of the printing press and national mailing systems in Europe allowed for the emergence of much larger and denser social networks among the elites in Europe. This allowed for the formation of what is termed *The Republic of Letters,* a social network for scientifically and philosophically inclined elites who were able to distribute ideas and discoveries amongst each other at a much more rapid rate than they would have been able to otherwise.^(28) 

So, to return to Middle Earth, the questions we should be asking are: Were there reasons that elites in Middle Earth should be biased against adopting pro-scientific cultural attitudes, how large were the social networks amongst elites, and how dense were the social networks among the elites. 

Let’s start with the latter two questions about density and size of the network. In essence, this is asking us to investigate communication technology in Middle Earth. In general, it seems to me to be quite poor (with a couple of exceptions). Some of our evidence for this comes from the fact that the Palantiri, the seeing stones which essentially function as a long range communication device, are so highly valued. That they are so rare and so highly valued indicates lack of an alternative but similar technology, suggesting no magical means of communication is common. As for more traditional means of communication… it’s complicated? As far as I can tell, the Shire has essentially a totally functioning postal system. We get explicit reference to Bilbo and Frodo receiving mail on a regular basis. This is fairly in keeping with other aspects we learn about the Shire’s government like the presence of mayors and a professionalized police force.

However, this network doesn’t seem to extend even to close neighbors like Bree, as when Gandalf needs to send a letter to Frodo from the Prancing Pony his best option is to just leave it with the proprietor who in turn attempts (and fails) to hire random laborers to walk it to the Shire? This suggests an abysmal lack of communication institutions interregionally. As far as I can tell, none of the other locations we visit have anything better to offer and the Shire seems unique in this property. This suggests we are looking at a world where, relative to our world in the 18th century, information spreads much slower and the average person is exposed to fewer sources of new ideas. Thus, it seems probable cultural shifts would occur at a much slower rate.

As to the third question about cultural spread, whether we think the residents of Middle Earth have reasons that make them more or less likely to adopt cultural attitudes that inculcate scientific discovery, I think this can go both ways. 

u/Username42 on reddit responded to my post last week and basically predicated the case in favor of a negative bias that I was going to make (and as I am lazy I am more than happy for others to do my work for me):

*This kind of cultural change would be much less likely in Middle-Earth than in our world because most of the great disasters in the history of Arda come from innovation going wrong. The unleashing of the Balrog and destruction of Khazad-Dum came from the dwarves pushing their mining and industrialisation efforts too far. The Numenoreans were highly militarised and are hinted to have more advanced technology than anywhere in the Third Age, and their ambition got them all drowned by the Valar. Celebrimbor developed new technology for Rings of Power but Sauron was able to exploit them and gain power over their bearers. Back in the First Age, Feanor's development of the Silmarils led to the Kinslaying and the War of the Jewels, and you could even argue that the introduction of sin into the world into the Ainulindale was Melkor attempting to innovate beyond the these presented by Illuvatar.*

*If you're an elite scholar in Middle-Earth, you're raised on stories of everyone who tries to develop anything radically new getting punished for their hubris, and even though it's thousands of years ago, there are many people in the world like Elrond and Galadriel who were literally alive at the time those events happened. It's not an environment that's conducive to someone like Francis Bacon becoming a cultural icon as he did in the European Enlightenment.*

I have a couple of quibbles here and there about the specifics (not sure the Dwarves specifically were increasing in technological capability and it leaves out that the main reason for the sinking of Numenor was the attempted invasion of Valinor) but I think the thrust of this proposition is right. We would expect the deep study of past failures resulting from attempts at development to create a deep resistance to technical progress among the elite. 

So, it would seem that Tolkien has defeated me once again. Perhaps Middle Earth is, in fact, internally consistent and these are, in fact, genre defining books worthy of praise rather than overpriced doorstops whose greatest contribution to literature was laying the groundwork for the literary genius that was *I'm a Behemoth, an S-Ranked Monster, but Mistaken for a Cat, I Live as an Elf Girl's Pet***.**^(29) 

I think this thesis overlooks a key element in favor of Middle Earth being pro science. Fundamentally, to think that Middle Earth should have a culture of stagnation, you have to accept that multiple lesser gods are just fundamentally, absolutely and irrevocably terrible at their jobs. 

Let’s back up. For those who aren’t in the loop on the finer details of Ardaian Theology, in the beginning there was Eru Illuvatar. Eru wanted there to be more than just Eru, so they made a bunch of disembodied spirits who were really good at singing to sing a planet into existence. Melkor, one of these spirits (and basically the Vader to Sauron’s Kylo Ren) was like *“Nah dude, you all want to sing some pansy-ass gospel music but I think we should sing some death metal*”. This led to strenuous disagreement. Long story short, big G God ends up sending a bunch of lowercase g gods known as the Valar to the physical world to help guide mortals.

Why am I regaling you with this? Because included among those lesser gods is Aule the Smith. Aule the Smith, is, surprisingly, the god of Smiths, Craftsmen, Invention etc. We are explicitly told in the text of the Silmarillion (which, again, I have not read) that *“He is a smith and a master of all crafts, and he delights in works of skill”*. And he isn’t just invested in old or traditional ways of crafting. The text (allegedly) tells us that he *“desired to make things of \[his\] own that should be new and unthought of by others, and delighted in the praise of \[his\] skill.”*

And apparently Aule is very invested in imparting his ideology! We learn that *“Of him comes the lore and knowledge of the Earth and of all things that it contains: whether the lore of those that make not, but seek only for the understanding of what is, or the lore of all craftsmen: the weaver, the shaper of wood, and the worker in metals”* This sure sounds like a god who might want to stick his thumb on the scale in favor of science to me! Aule is actually so on board with teaching people how to make cool stuff that he skips the queue and makes sentient life thousands of years ahead of when it was supposed to emerge on earth: *“It is told that in their beginning the Dwarves were made by Aulë in the darkness of Middle-earth; for so greatly did Aulë desire the coming of the Children, to have learners to whom he could teach his lore and his crafts, that he was unwilling to await the fulfilment of the designs of Ilúvatar.”*

So, this is where, after approximately 9,000 words of exposition, I can finally hit Tolkien with a couple of barbs. Because exactly what has Aule, a literal deity who wants people to learn craftsmanship and facts, been doing for the last 35,000 years?^(30) Clearly nothing useful given the abysmal state of Middle Earth. This, I think, is the fundamental flaw in the causal chain. We know explicitly that the Valar are deities with a positive interest in the flourishing of… humankind? Elfkind? Peoplekind? The group of sentient people that populate Middle Earth. Why are they doing nothing to kick Middle Earth out of this negative equilibrium of stagnation? Given that their benevolence is basically stipulated, I think the only option left is to assume incompetence. As surely this is not what Tolkien intended, I deem him a failure whose greatest legacy is the existence of *ElfQuest*.

**Conclusion to Part II:**

So, if you buy science as a necessary condition of industrialization, then I think you are stuck in a bind between thinking Middle Earth is internally consistent and thinking that it’s gods are like, good at their jobs. This maybe isn’t the biggest worry ever however. I mean look at Gandalf, he’s an angelic emmissary of one of the gods and his best plan for saving the world involves 2 hobbits going on the worlds longest and least supervised field trip. 

Having now covered resources, factor prices, and science but somehow my determination to engage in what is, if we are honest, a fundamentally pointless excercise is holding on by a thread. So join us next time where we ask: should Gondor expect a Spanish Inquisition?

524,gexb62,2020-05-07,badeconomics,"Technological Unemployment: Kurzgesagt, Lump of Labour and the Luddite Fallacy","Normally I'd shy away from the YouTube ""intellectual community"" because it's bad everything. However, for the sake of critiquing fundamentalists on both ends of the automation debate, I decided to give a go at [*The Rise of the Machines— Why Automation is Different this Time*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKi8HfcxEk) by Kurzgesagt (spoiler: it's not).

##Part I: ""Jobs"" aren't Exogenous

>Innovation made human work easier and productivity rose, which means that more stuff or services could be produced per hour, using the same amount of human workers.

The writers for Kurzgesagt acknowledge that output equals productivity times workers. So far so good. This can be expressed mathematically as Y/N ≡ A, where Y is output and N is the population, and A is the quotient of the former, aka **productivity**.

>This also created other jobs that were better, which is important because the growing population needed work.

The question is, why wouldn't it? For sake of simplicity, let's imagine a closed economy in equilibrium.^1 The aggregate demand of this economy can be modelled as

AD = c0 + c1(Y - T) + I + G where
 
I = -c0 + (1 - c1)(Y - T) + T - G

When we substitute that in for I, we get

AD = c0 + c1(Y - T) + (-c0 + (1 - c1)(Y - T) + T - G) + G  which simplifies to

AD = Y and if we divide this by the population again we get

AD/N = Y/N

What this means is that how much work we do is proportional to how much we consume.^2,3 Population has zero impact on the availability of jobs, and this is true probably even in the short run. In other words, an even decrease in the labour supply results in a proportional decrease in labour demand. A growing population does not need to ""find"" new work.

##Part II: Cars vs Computers

>In 1979 General Motors employed more than 800 thousand workers and made about 11bln USD; in 2012, Google made about 14bln USD while employing 58 thousand people.

Well where do I even start? Firstly, the American automotive industry was already fully matured by 1979 and, with competition from Europe and Japan, was just barely no longer reaping the economic profit it once had from running an effective monopoly on auto sales in the first two and a half decades after WWII. Google in 2012 by contrast, was no where near their peak. In fact, [Alphabet now employs more than twice as many people as it did in 2012.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273744/number-of-full-time-google-employees/)

Upon verification, the claims about earnings seem to be really funky. No sources are provided for the video, but their ""Google earnings"" for 2012 seem to actually be Google's revenue for Q4 2012, and the GM numbers don't seem to come from anywhere. I don't think Kurzgesagt is lying, it's probably just compounding of a translation error with bad inflation data (and maybe exchange rates). In real terms, [1979 GM had close to 5x the revenue](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/03/business/general-motors-reports-80-loss-of-763-million.html) of [2012 Google](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/revenue).

But the more important reason I point this out is why wouldn't we expect this? Kurzgesagt acknowledges that technology has causes specialization and a higher standard of living, so why wouldn't we expect higher capital, revenue, and profit per worker? That is what meaningful growth is after all.

Comparing two specific firms across industries is obviously futile, so to really dig into this point I'm going to go for occupations. I couldn't find any particularly reputable/academic sources on this, but it seems that the UAW peaked in 1979 at around 1.5 million members, and per the UAW itself, has around 400 thousand members today. By contrast, there are about 1.6 million [Computer Programmers](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htm) and [Software Developers](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm) **alone**. So actually yes, the tech industry more than replaced the automotive industry.

>It's not enough to substitute old jobs with new ones, we need to be generating new jobs constantly because the world population is growing... but since 1973, the generation of new jobs in the US has begun to shrink.

The supposed job growth before the 90's was merely a formality. At the beginning of the 19th century [there was enough domestic labour needed for a typical household to equate to a full time job](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/03/Share-of-US-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances-with-working-hours-2-750x525.png). While the state might not consider them to be active in the labour force, the women who were doing the vast majority of that labour were carrying out an economic activity, it is work. However, [by 1970 this had been reduced to just 18 hours](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/03/Share-of-US-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances-with-working-hours-750x525.png) for a two person household because of automation- not even a part time job. In accordance with what we'd expect from neoclassical models, those women increasingly started to get commercial pay rolled jobs during their new found free time, which resulted in them showing up as part of the labour force.

##Part III: Labour isn't a Griffen Good

>A San Francisco company offers a project management software for big corporations which is supposed to eliminate middle management positions. When it's hired for a new project, the software first decides which jobs can be automated, and precisely where it needs actual professional humans. It then helps assemble a team of freelancers over the internet. The software then distributes tasks to the humans, and controls the quality of the work, tracking individual performance until the project is complete. Okay, this doesn't sound too bad. While this machine is killing one job, it creates jobs for freelancers, right? Well, as the freelancers complete their tasks, learning algorithms track them and gather data about their work and which tasks it consists of; so what's actually happening is that the freelancers are teaching a machine how to replace them.

This seems like a straightforward ""labour is an inferior good"" argument until we actually unpack what is being argued here: Essentially, this ""machine"" (technology) is lowering the cost of labour for a given output, increasing the efficiency of labour. The writers then assert without evidence that this will decrease the utilization of labour by firms. If labour is an inferior (which it isn't, but we'll get back to this) perfect substitute (which it isn't) for capital, this *might* be the case. However, since this technology is actually changing the marginal rate of technical substitution between labour and capital by making labour relatively more efficient, the cost minimizing solution for firms to maintain output would actually be to reduce their use of capital!

##Part IV: Actually, Humans are Horses (sorta)

Settle down settle down, I can already hear the people in the comments exclaiming that [labour force participation has increased](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CIVPART), that people will [readjust their skills for an automated world](https://economics.mit.edu/files/9835), and that [humans will still have comparative advantage in at least something](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/6gw9vu/the_rise_of_the_machines_why_automation_is/ditjwyk/).

All of these are true, and none of them mean that labour isn't possibly an inferior good.

It's important to understand that a few people do end up being left unemployable (or at least, far less employable) by technological advancements in a way that education simply cannot makeup for. In 1850 when most people farmed and [few knew how to read anyway](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/literate-and-illiterate-world-population), being predisposed to dyslexia did not matter. In a world where virtually all jobs require the ability to read and write, [this is now a significant barrier to occupational success for those people](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/development-and-psychopathology/article/psychosocial-correlates-of-dyslexia-across-the-life-span/17318B091DC5E96E6062C1FD3E4FB2FE) It's entirely possible (though not certain) we could see a similar impact on people predisposed to dyscalculia as we move into the 21st century and mathematical skills become very important.

As stated earlier, it is somewhat of a myth that it was atypical for women to work before the 70's, it just wasn't counted in the labour force. Men, for whom it has always been the norm to do wage/commercial labour, have had their labour force participation [substantially decline](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300001), but a significant part of that is the due to greatly expanded tertiary education participation and the increasingly large retired population. Yet, [even middle age males](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRAC25MAUSM156S) are less likely, albeit moderately, to work than in the past. What causes this? I don't know, and it's actually pretty widely debated among economists. It could be that we've become institutionally more accepting of [working age men doing that informal, unpaid work](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/06/05/growing-number-of-dads-home-with-the-kids/) that women used to dominate. It could be automation, or it could be any number of accounting and social factors that haven't been considered.

>(Despite) the US population growing by over 40 million, there was no growth at all in the number of hours worked in 15 years.

This is true, people who do work are working less, but also [as we get richer](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdppercapita-vs-annual-hours-worked?time=..). For people in developed countries, labour is an [inferior good](https://www.jstor.org/stable/135120?casa_token=2VybzKyoJkYAAAAA:SEcbS90cDL6tXh3e73xGSvzJtKIuQycASDHo7rzTP9NZ1DPmZVGgyzdkvMPtd2Uz46H7ZtYUe_l6VV9T5dETXJ5sTSIPg7ZEfyBd_AFjTPHsHzFnCcqWKw&seq=7#metadata_info_tab_contents)^(4). This doesn't mean that people want to work and can't get it, but rather that at some point, the time it takes to buy even more consumer goods just isn't worth it for people, and we're starting to hit that point in the places like the US and Europe. Further, this i a good thing as long working hours strongly associated with [bad psychosocial and health outcomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5285313/).

In conclusion, automation good, YouTube ""educational"" channels bad.

525,fejncq,2020-03-06,badeconomics,Bernie Sanders' financing plans do not add up.,"First post, go easy on me

Released a week ago [here](https://berniesanders.com/issues/how-does-bernie-pay-his-major-plans/), Sanders outlines his strategy to fund his proposals.  However, I see several gaps in his funding plan:

&nbsp;
### M4A baseline numbers

He estimates that healthcare spending under M4A will cost $47.5 Trillion total: $30 trillion in existing government spending + $17.5 trillion in new spending.  This runs counter to the three independent studies I've seen on the estimated costs of M4A:

* [Urban institute: $32 trillion](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/99151/estimating_the_cost_of_a_single-payer_plan_0.pdf)
* [Mercatus: $32.6](https://www.mercatus.org/publications/government-spending/costs-national-single-payer-healthcare-system)
* [Center for Health and Economy: $34.67 trillion. Alternative scenario with a more generous benefits: $47.55 trillion ](https://healthandeconomy.org/medicare-for-all-leaving-no-one-behind/)

Even [Sanders says it will cost 30-40 trillion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/postlive/wplive/sen-bernie-sanders-says-medicare-for-all-would-cost-30-to-40-trillion-over-10-year-period/2019/07/16/3c9052b9-9f1e-47ed-bc4e-50e9d7007f36_video.html) when asked.

Where is he getting his numbers? He links two studies, one is [centers for medicare and medicaid services study on projected cost increases](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsProjected), which does not include any of the 10 year numbers he uses.  The other study is from the Lancet discusses cost savings to the country, and not the cost to the government.

These numbers do not take into account the uninsured (""Uninsured spending on healthcare cannot be estimated or projected due to data limitations"").  They also count sources of revenue for government programs that wouldn't exist under M4A, such as $4.8 trillion for current Medicare out of pocket payments, and $2 trillion for Charity Funding.  It seems pretty clear that this oversimplified math does not take into account even close to the full costs compared to the status quo.

&nbsp;
### Employer payroll taxes

While I see no indication that these numbers are inaccurate, they are at least somewhat misleading, as [economic consensus](https://web.archive.org/web/20100713154141/http://www.americanbenefitscouncil.org/documents/bush_taxbenefits_1pager.pdf) generally accepts that the overwhelming majority of payroll taxes end up being borne by employees, not employers.  So while this will likely raise the expected revenue, they will do so on the backs of workers, not corporations.

&nbsp;
### Health tax expenditures

Sanders plans to raise 3 trillion by ""Eliminating health tax expenditures, which would no longer be needed under Medicare for All.""  I'm not clear what he means by this, but under the assumption that he's using the same definition as everyone else, he seems to be saying that we'll be able to generate additional revenue by ending the tax exemption for health insurance premiums.  Considering he'd also essentially be ending insurance premiums, I'm not sure where this 3 trillion in taxes is coming from.

&nbsp;
###  Preferential rate on capital gains

His plan to end and increase the preferential rate on capital gains is estimated around 2.5 trillion, almost two orders of magnitude higher than the $60 billion estimate of the revenue maximum from [this paper from upenn](https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2019/11/21/policy-options-increase-tax-rates-on-capital-gains-amp-dividends).

&nbsp;
### Repealing Trump tax cuts

He also claims 3 trillion by increasing top federal corporate income tax rate to 35 percent (repealing the Tax Cut and Jobs Act).  The studies I can find on this from [the JCT](https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=5055) and [tax foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/final-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-details-analysis/) show that the actual cost to the government over 10 years to be between $448 billion and $1.071 trillion (or $1.47 trillion with static scoring), far less than his claimed revenues.

This is not even getting started on [how bad economists consider corporate taxes to be](http://www.nber.org/data-appendix/w19757/CorporateTaxPaper.pdf).

&nbsp;
### Financial Transaction tax

Sanders estimates revenues of $2.4 trillion from a financial transaction tax.  The CBO [scored a smilier plan](https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/2018/54823) and found that it raises significantly less revenue than Sanders estimates, which is in line with historical results, [such as the one attempted by Sweeden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_financial_transaction_tax).

&nbsp;
### Wealth tax

Sanders estimates receipts of $4.35 trillion, far less than the [$2.6 trillion estimated by the tax foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/wealth-tax/). These taxes are generally difficult to enforce and have some serious externalities, which is why [Europe largely abandoned them](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/02/26/698057356/if-a-wealth-tax-is-such-a-good-idea-why-did-europe-kill-theirs).  There's also the likelyhood they this tax is [unconstitutional](https://np.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/e6lsn1/smaug_hardly_why_billionaires_are_not_dragons/f9t7lug/) especially with the current makeup of the supreme court.

&nbsp;
### Missing completely from this funding plan: his Jobs Guarantee

Sanders is missing a few other spending proposals in this funding plan, such as his jobs guarantee, which could cost [as much as 30 trillion dollars by itself](https://www.city-journal.org/bernie-sanders-expensive-spending-proposals)",akcrono,t2_f1p79,0.83,474,419
526,rmw5wh,2021-12-23,badeconomics,The /r/economics FAQ on automation is clearly nonsensical and bad economics.,"The FAQ is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_automation) and in part 2 states:

""The industrial revolution itself shows why the lump of labor fallacy is wrong.

Before the invention of the steam engine, more than 95% of humans were employed on farms, whereas today this number is around 2%. The remaining 93% of the population didn't disappear or go out of a job. Instead, automating farm work freed up the labor force to be put to more productive use over time. Some young laborers went to school instead of working on the family farm, while others started working in factories. Over time, the labor force reallocated away from agriculture and into manufacturing and services.

Similarly, as tasks are automated in the modern economy (such as manufacturing tasks) workers will shift their time into other tasks like the growing service economy.""

Let's break this down. 

""Before the invention of the steam engine, more than 95% of humans were employed on farms, whereas today this number is around 2%.""

Okay, let's take this figure of 95% at face value.

> The remaining 93% of the population didn't disappear or go out of a job.

Didn't they? What percentage of human are employed at all today? Let's look shall we?

From [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.IN) we can see that global labour force consisted on 3.474 billion people in 2019 and from [here](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/#table-historical) we can see that the global population was 7.713 billion people. This gives a value of 45% for the percentage of humans employed today.

So, the author of the automation FAQ on /r/economics would have readers believe that the percentage of humans employed has dropped from over 95% to 45% today without any workers going out of jobs.

As a mixed economy that leans towards capitalism, goverment assistance in America for things like [housing](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2017/04/13/430424/2008-housing-crisis/#:%7E:text=The%20Financial%20Crisis%20Inquiry%20Commission,do%20not%20have%20these%20requirements) will be [controlled by the free market](https://jacobinmag.com/2018/11/capitalism-affordable-housing-rent-commodities-profit)

This leads to many instances where people who need assistance won't even get it. Instead money is wasted giving it to those who wouldn't need such assistance to begin with. And almost all of these disparities just so happen fall along racial lines.

Let me first set up how geographic monopolies of private defense will arise in Libertopia.

Consider Firms A and B. They are both private defense agencies. They compete with each other in some geographic area (say, Freedomopolis) for customers. They have two choices: they can either attempt to price discriminate and charge monopoly prices, or compete with each other. Firms A and B essentially have each half of the city to themselves, spread out over the entire area.

Given the oddities of demand, they can essentially split the city in half and price discriminate on both sides, or they can continue to compete and neither have a large section of the city to themselves. However, if one attempts to split the city in half and the other competes, the company attempting to split the city in half gets nothing.[ The payoff matrix looks like this.](http://i.imgur.com/Gr1SPYY.png) I've done the best responses for you, and they're circled.

We have two equilibria. We have the ""AnCap"" equilibria and the ""PDAs are states"" equilibria. Implicitly, AnCaps think that we will be at (Compete, Compete) forever.

This doesn't make a ton of sense to me. Why should we be at that equilibrium? It would behoove PDAs to simply split up Freedomopolis. There is no agency that can stop them from colluding. But once these PDAs have split up the city, why are they not simply states by another name?

So then we have this claim as to why this monopolization won't happen.

>They have a choice in choosing another provider.

Okay, so now we have a new entrant question. [Consider this game tree.]( http://i.imgur.com/a8bYl9C.png)

This implicitly covers the objections such as:

>It means the company has to survive potenitally massive losses for up to several years before any conceivable profit could occur

We can see from the game tree that the Entrant would not enter the market, because the Entrant knows that Firm A will fight upon entry. Firm A, upon fighting, will win because of its superior size. However, it will take a loss, and thus doesn't maintain the original payoff of 3. But, the Entrant loses out big time - the Entrant dies after Firm A drops a JDAM on their HQ on the corner of Rothbard and Block in Freedomopolis. Thus the mere threat of fighting - which Entrant knows will happen - stops Entrant from entering the market. Thus, customers no longer have any outside options.

From here on out, I'll just use some more verbal argumentation.

>Violence is expensive, plus then their customers/shareholders find out they're violently attacking their competitors and they lose business, or the CEO gets fired and they stop attacking people.

Alternatively, waging war is profitable in the long-run. Investors who want a payout for establishing a government might loan money to this company. There is also no reason to believe a priori that these companies will be publicly traded on some stock exchange. Lastly, customer's need not have a choice - threat of violence can be enough to keep people stuck in their contracts.

Furthermore, if violence is expensive, this should mean that any PDA that wants a customer to stay a customer can threaten a rival PDA with violence to stop them from poaching customers. It is odd to assume that violence is expensive, thus PDAs will cooperate - instead, since violence is expensive, this will solidify control over customers as PDAs want to avoid conflict and thus carve out certain customer bases for themselves (going back to my PD/PD solution).

>If companies care about long-term profits then they should also be concerned about making sure their customers are happy and healthy and the environment in which they operate is sustained.

This is not true at all. A PDA that acts as a monopolist is no different than a state. States routinely create extractive institutions (yeah, borrowing from Acemoglu and Robinson, sorry) that do very little for citizens ruled by the state. A prime example would be the Soviet Union.

As soon as a PDA becomes a monopolist, any libertarian argument against the state applies to the PDA. But apparently if we call the PDA a ""business"" we can throw all libertarian critiques of the state out the window.

>It means the company has to survive potenitally massive losses for up to several years before any conceivable profit could occur, and virtually every other security company and customer of the company would know it.

So what if there are years of massive losses? So long as the company will be the victor over the long run, short-run costs now make up for the long-run benefits. Think of these losses as simply going into debt for short time.

I wanted to take a closer look at his healthcare policy.

I'm not a healthcare economist or even a real economist (I'm a filthy (((banker)))/finance guy) but I do enjoy shitposting, so here goes. His full plan can be found here: https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/healthcare-reform

>Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to.

In terms of lowering healthcare costs, it seems to me that repealing the individual mandate would increase costs across the board. Assuming that insurance companies are still required to cover those with pre-existing conditions, the people who aren't participating in healthcare markets would primarily fall into two categories: 1) the very healthy/young, who don't need healthcare and 2) those who can't afford it altogether (especially without the tax credits).

With the first group not participating, you're basically maintaining the total costs of the insurance pool (numerator) while shrinking the people participating in the pool (denominator). If you're spreading the same costs among fewer people, premiums would have to increase for the people who actually need/use insurance. Both groups of people will still need healthcare services, but likely won't have any way to pay for them when they need them. When the healthy 25 year old barista gets hit by a car, the costs emergency room visit will fall to the taxpayer through charity care or bankruptcy. There is a similar argument for health insurance as there is for car insurance, and health care costs can rack up just as quickly.

Without the inclusion of people with preexisting conditions by law, insurers will choose to not insurance individuals who will cost them money, and these people will either have to a) fall out of the insurance market, and be a burden to the taxpayers as they required medical services they are unable to pay for, or b) come into a government insurance scheme, where they are paid for by the taxpayers.

>Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up.

This sounds great in theory – if you let everyone compete across state lines, each state will have more competition and drive prices down. In reality, while it might reduce the variance in plans across states I would imagine costs are staying the same, you might have some overhead savings, but doubtful there would be enough to move the needle since most insurance companies have de facto overhead rate caps from the ACA already.

The true outcome would probably look more like another highly regulated industry that went through a similar process in 1997, banking. In 1994 the Reigle-Neal Interstate Banking Act was passed with an effective date in 1997. Since then, we've seen massive amount of consolidation in major banks to the point of creating a few superbanks supplemented by some regional banks that are a fraction of the size (http://2oqz471sa19h3vbwa53m33yj.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bank-consolidation.jpg and http://online.wsj.com/media/snl3q.gif). Is there any reason to think insurance companies wouldn’t follow suit?

>Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldn’t Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it.

This whole bullet seems to lack cohesiveness. Full deductibility of health insurance premiums doesn't do anything to make it more affordable for poor people, who are likely already not paying federal income taxes anyway.  Additionally, there are myriad expenses that businesses are allowed to deduct that individuals are not, so why call out health insurance specifically? Why can't I deduct my grocery and transportation expenses as well? 

Additionally, allowing individuals to deduct premiums is likely going to increase premiums in the long run. If someone is paying $5,000 a year in non-taxed income right now, they should also be willing to pay $6,000 a year at a 20% tax rate. Since this is going to be the freest healthcare market on earth, prices will likely adjust over time as the number of insurance companies moves closer to oligopoly.

>Allow individuals to use Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Contributions into HSAs should be tax-free and should be allowed to accumulate. These accounts would become part of the estate of the individual and could be passed on to heirs without fear of any death penalty. These plans should be particularly attractive to young people who are healthy and can afford high-deductible insurance plans. These funds can be used by any member of a family without penalty. The flexibility and security provided by HSAs will be of great benefit to all who participate.

I actually like this idea on the whole, but it does nothing to help make medical coverage more affordable for poor people. If you can barely make ends meet, you certainly can't afford to take additional money out of your paycheck to save for medical costs you aren't even sure you're going to need! 

>Require price transparency from all healthcare providers, especially doctors and healthcare organizations like clinics and hospitals. Individuals should be able to shop to find the best prices for procedures, exams or any other medical-related procedure.

This makes the incorrect assumptions that the only factor people put into healthcare decisions is price. In reality, people are likely to want to keep their current doctor for existing needs, and utilize referrals of friends and family for new needs. Since medical care is not a uniform good, people will continue to discriminate based on perceived quality as they likely already are. People have the options to use free clinics in major cities and other inexpensive options (like the nurse practitioners who operate at CVS/Walgreens) and still choose to use family physicians who cost more. 

On top of that, the insurance company is paying the majority of the cost, so price discrimination is nearly non-existent for people among providers in their coverage network. If all doctors are going to cost me $35 per office visit, I don't really care if the insurance company is paying $100 or $200 additionally. Cost sharing type plans help, but PPO plans wouldn't see this type of discrimination. Personally, if I had to get open heart surgery I would opt for a surgeon with a great reputation and top-notch training at a well-respected facility, not the bargain basement guy operating out of a converted law office. Especially since my costs are essentially fixed.

> Block-grant Medicaid to the states. Nearly every state already offers benefits beyond what is required in the current Medicaid structure. The state governments know their people best and can manage the administration of Medicaid far better without federal overhead. States will have the incentives to seek out and eliminate fraud, waste and abuse to preserve our precious resources.

Block granting won't do anything to reduce costs by itself, it just sticks the state taxpayers with the bill. If/when they run out of money then they either have to reduce services or reduce provider payments, both of which are anathema to The Best Healthcare Plan©. It is also non-responsive to changing needs, which could negatively affect areas undergoing large structural changes in their economies at a rapid pace (like, oh I dunno, states with declining employment bases like the Rust Belt). A few big factories closed in your state unexpectedly this year? Sorry, you get what you get. 

States already have tremendous flexibility to alter their Medcaid plans to meet the needs of their citizens, without the Ryan-esque threat of cuts hanging over their heads. Knowing that Ryan plans to decrease Medicaid funding by ~50% by 2023 won't push states towards providing better, cheaper care for the citizens who need it most.

> Remove barriers to entry into free markets for drug providers that offer safe, reliable and cheaper products. Congress will need the courage to step away from the special interests and do what is right for America. Though the pharmaceutical industry is in the private sector, drug companies provide a public service. Allowing consumers access to imported, safe and dependable drugs from overseas will bring more options to consumers.

This one I'm actually kind of unsure of. It's one of those things that sounds great to a layman, but I don't know enough about the economics of the generic drug market to intelligently make a conclusion. It seems that Trump's team thinks of generic imports as a panacea for lowering drug costs, but I suspect that there are reasons it has not been implemented other than lobbying that it has not been implemented.

As it stands, we pretty much have a generic drug ready the first day a patent expires in the US, so unless he is talking about scrapping patent law I'm not sure what he's getting at. Hopefully somebody who is better informed can help me out here.

534,98ubc1,2018-08-20,badeconomics,Bad Work Week Economics in BadEconomics: The “Productivity/Workweek Length Myth” Myth,"Several weeks ago our dear subreddit saw a well-received [post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/8ygkfc/existential_comics_and_the_productivityworkweek/) critiquing celebrated philosophy comic creator and Twitter socialist Existential Comic’s [claim]( https://twitter.com/existentialcoms/status/948646228614463488?lang=en) that working hours have not declined as productivity has risen. The assertion was countered by a handy [chart]( https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/AWHNONAG) from the St. Louis Fed, which as /u/VodkaHaze points out, pretty clearly shows that over the last fifty years (though admittedly, [not over the last fifteen years]( https://imgur.com/a/fdib5Xa)), the *average* work week has massively dropped. 
However, I argue that this situation is not as straightforward as it 
seems, and I present the following points: 

**Much of the decline reported in the original post took place in the first part of the last fifty years; within the last fifteen years, the work week has indeed stalled**.

**The use of the average work week is misleading: a massive increase in part time work has drawn the average down, and if we look just at full-time employees, the work week has not just flatlined, but increased significantly over the last fifty years.**

**The modest decline in the average work week coincided with a massive increase in female labor force participation, so that the *per capita* paid work week increased significantly.**

---

The first point is fairly easy to highlight. If we focus on only the last fifteen years or so in the linked St. Louis Fed data, [we can see]( https://imgur.com/a/fdib5Xa) that the average work week has not declined, on the aggregate, since 2003, when the downward trend of earlier decades stopped. In 2003/4 the average sat at around 33.7 hours/week; after a fairly substantial dip during the recession, the average returned to about 33.7 by 2012 and has more or less sat there ever since. Indeed, ignoring the effects of the recession things seem to have completely flatlined. Existential’s assertion therefore holds some water even when generously looking at just the average numbers.

In fact, a significant sociological literature has developed around this topic. Sociologist Juliet Schor, for example, has published [an entire book](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/230106) on  “the unexpected decline of leisure”, where she finds that work times have significantly *increased* for full-time workers. Importantly, this book was published in 1993, studying the period during which according to our FRED graph, *work week length was declining the fastest*. Instead, Dr. Schor found that in the previous twenty years, the work year had actually *increased* by **nearly a month**. This study took into account not just raw hours, but also items like vacation and sick time taken, which are not accounted for in the FRED statistics, while looking at full time and part time work separately (something I discuss in the next section). This is on top of other trends, like [rising commute times]( https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2017/12/20/yes-your-commute-really-is-getting-longer/), which have further decreased leisure time for Americans. 

Secondly, using the raw average, as /u/VodkaHaze did, is somewhat misleading. Over the period the FRED data covers, we have also seen a [massive increase](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/part-time-employment)^1 in part-time employment. This issue has been discussed by [other scholars]( https://www.jstor.org/stable/25072473?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) and in the [popular press]( https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/the-rise-of-part-time-work/), and is generally well established. Importantly, this increase isn’t just a result of full-time workers transitioning into part-time work. Rather, the exploding number of part-timers were largely drawn from groups not traditionally in the labor force, for example [the elderly]( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/20/more-older-americans-are-working-and-working-more-than-they-used-to/) and most significantly, women. 

This brings me to my third point: the massive influx of women into the labor force over the period this data covers. Sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild of Berkeley cites the following numbers in her *The Commercialization of Intimate Life* (pg. 217):

>American women have gone into work in extraordinary numbers. In 1960, 28% of married women with children were working. More mother than nonmothers now work. In 1948, 11% of married women with children aged six and younger worked outside the home. In 1991, 60% did. Today over half of all mothers of children one year and younger are in the labor force.

These numbers hold up for single women as well. But Dr. Hochschild focuses on women with children for good reason: her text presents evidence that female entry into the workforce either comes at the expense of unpaid home labor needed to keep the household running and children socialized, or is now paired with it, with many women now working the sociologically infamous “second shift” where women bear the burden of most housework even as their hours of paid labor equalize with men. The point is that this is not an unused labor reserve being drawn into the workforce: we’re either giving up on doing important [social reproduction labor]( https://www.plutobooks.com/blog/social-reproduction-theory-ferguson/)^2, or taking on an additional paid shift on top of the unpaid and unmeasured work we already do. 

The bottom line is this: **Looking at the working week as one long downwards trend since the days of the infernal mills is obscuring the full story. While work hours have certainly declined since the 19th century, they have *increased* in the last fifty years, as full-time workers put in significantly more hours while sections of the population that historically did not perform wage labor enter both full and part time work. Even the average has flatlined in the last fifteen years. Existential’s tweet is therefore rooted in empirical fact.**

^1 My apologies for this source, BLS was down when I was writing this. Discerning readers will notice that this source lists absolute numbers rather than proportions, perhaps weakening my point. My response is that looking at these absolute numbers, we can quickly calculate that while the part-time workforce has increased some 175% since 1970, total US population has increased (according to Google) by about 60%. The part time workforce has both proportionately and absolutely increased over this time period. 

^2 This topic has its own rich history beyond the purview of this post; social thinkers at least as far back as Marx have suggested that capitalism mobilizes paid labor at the expense of unpaid but nevertheless socially essential reproductive labor (where reproduction refers not to biological reproduction, but to the social reproduction, or socialization, of persons). This proposition has led to some interesting movements over the years, for example a feminist proposal in the 1970s that housewives be paid by their husbands for their domestic work.

*   **Raw Score** (upvotes - downvotes) is bad because a comment with many votes might have a large score but a relatively low % of users who upvoted it. A comment with 4500 upvotes and 4000 downvotes would be scores above a comment with 400 upvotes and 0 downvotes.

*   **Average Rating** (upvotes / [upvotes + downvotes]) is bad for the opposite reason -- posts with very few votes will have either a perfect or terrible score (due low sample size and sheer luck) and the overall ranking will vary wildly. Posts with many votes will tend toward their real score, which is generally less than perfect, so they won't be at the top.

*   Reddit's **""Best""** scoring method calculates the 95% statistical lower confidence bound of the upvote/downvote ratio. Read his blog post if you want the math. Better yet, I pulled up the [actual reddit source code][4] for you to see how it's calculated.

If you want to see what the ""best"" score looks like, I plotted the output for a post with a 85% upvote ratio from [0 to 100 votes](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Capture-300x196.png)

We see that the score does converge to its true score, but it takes about 25 votes for it to get there. Below that number of votes, the comment has an artificially lower score due the best formula puinishing small sample sizes.

### Feedback Loops

Here's an observation: *A comment sorted at the top gets seen by more people*. But the converse is also true -- comments sorted at the bottom won't get seen by many readers, if any. 

Feedback loops aren't mentionned in Evan's blog post, but they were on the mind of the designers if they wanted to avoid the ""early comments stick at the top"" problem. This is still a problem. Almost all comments posted after a comment has reached critical mass in the top ranking will have a hard time getting the ~25  with their score by simply never gathering a sufficient sample size of votes to have a chance to be read by anyone. 

Here's some more sources to convince you: the paper I linked in the introduction finds on average 30% of discussion in a reddit post [is under a single top-level comment][2]. Other researchers find that manipulating the first vote on the post to be an upvote/downvote [has a large effect on final score][5]. The popular r/AmItheAsshole subreddit ran [its own little study](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cszj7a/60minute_contest_mode_is_here_to_stay_please_read/) and found that running all new posts in ""contest"" mode leads to better discussion quality.

The effect of this feedback loop is that the distribution of votes on comments follow a rough power-law distribution, even through the distribution of quality of comments clearly doesn't. This means the discussion quality on reddit is worse than it should be.

### A metric is not a ranking method

We discussed what metric to use for ranking here, but let's remind ourselves that ""descending ordering"" is just one way to rank a list of scores among many.

The best way to fix a feedback loop problem like this is by using an [exploration-exploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) framework. There are plenty of ways to do this, all of them giving new comments a chance while keeping the statistically ""best"" comments mostly at the top. [This blog](http://simplemlhacks.blogspot.com/2013/04/reddits-best-comment-scoring-algorithm.html?m=1&_sm_au_=isVNQSf0N1FVqstN) explored the topic and finds the [Thompson sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling) method performs best.


**TL;DR:** Reddit's method of ranking comments sucks. They should use some sort of exploration-exploitation method on it to make sure new comments have a chance of being at the top.

---------------------------------------------------------------

1.  I won't stop putting quotation marks around it. It's not ""the best"" scoring method and having it call itself that makes it too big for its britches and makes me want to take it down a notch.

2.  Go read MWG and come back to me -- determining how we rank things above other things is literally the mathematical basis of all of economics. It's also a subfield of game theory. Also you're banned.

## Introduction

We will begin by giving a survey of recent work in the incel dating market problem. We then give
a brief overview of the models in question. Next we provide a model reduction in order to demonstrate that our model is at least as powerful as a previous one and we show a violation
of incel assumptions in our model. Finally we discuss problems with the model and future work.

## Previous work

There has been some previous [4] work  done on modeling dating markets under the
assumptions held in incel models which seek to show that incel models are internally inconsistent.
The goal of the MamboMentality model is to show that under their specified mechanism that the strategy 
for women is truthy, a violation of an incel assumption. Other work
[9] [8] [7]
has shown empirically that in online dating users are typically fairly truthful of their self
representations. These studies have also tended to show that there are asymmetries in what male
and female users are hoping to receive, suggesting that the payoff functions for the two groups
are different.

There has also been significant interest in recent years in adapting classic matching problems to modern dating.
There is work [6] suggesting that dating in general is not in fact stable and so
the Stable Marriage Problem has some deficiencies in modeling dating markets.
Furthermore, even in the classic SMP Huang [3] showed that a group of men or
proposers may improve their overall utility by misrepresenting their preferences and this
cheating will not decrease the utility of any other men.

## Exposition of models

### Incel model

We will assume the following properties of an incel model based on previous empirical work.
[5]

1. Women gain value only from how much utility is transferred to them
1. Women will not play the truthful strategy in any mechanism
1. Women display high levels of promiscuity
1. Women are unintelligent and selfish
1. Women hold privilege over men, they receive better outcomes

### MamboMentality model (MM)

We first give an exposition of the MM model and incel assumptions.

The MM model can be represented as a complete bipartite graph with a part of men, [;M;], and a part of 
women, [;W;], where [;|W| = 1;].
We'll denote the set of signaled values that men receive about women as [;S\_m;] and
the set of signaled values that women give of themselves as [;S\_w;], and the unknown payoff function
[;V: M \times S\_m \times S\_w \to \mathbb{R};].
[;V;] is monotonically increasing in [;S\_m;] and [;S\_w;].
Note that [;|S\_m| = |S\_w|;] as the signal each man receives about a particular woman is the same
and each woman may only send one signal about themselves to all men.
The set [;S = S\_m \cup S\_w;] is also known globally to all people in the network.
Finally we have a cost function [;b: S\_m \to \mathbb{R};] representing what a man 
must pay if they are matched with a woman given the signal received by men for that woman.
This function is also known globally.
A man [;i;] will only date a woman [;j;] if their expected payoff is higher than their cost,
[;E[V(i, S\_{m\_j}, S\_{w\_j})] > b(S\_{m\_j});].
Ultimately, a man is matched with the woman if the woman receives the highest cost from
that man.

The model seeks to show that the woman's signalling strategy is truthful which violates an incel 
assumption.
This matching problem is reduced to a problem of auctions and it is shown that the auction mechanism
is truthful, implying that an incel assumption is violated.

There are some deficiencies in this model however. Firstly, it requires that [;|W|=1;], in other
words that there is only one woman over whom all men must compete. This is likely untrue in real
life dating markets. Furthermore, it requires an integral matching over the network. In actual
dating markets it is unrealistic to restrict all men and women to only date one person. Furthermore,
by our given assumption women are promiscuous and so are unlikely to take a single partner though
this assumption was not made in the original MM model.

### Stable Fractional Matching Problem (SFMP) model

We give a refinement of the MM model by showing a reduction to stable fractional matchings as given
by Caragiannis et al in 2019. [1]

We expand upon the model by relaxing the [;|W| = 1;] condition. We further relax the condition that
the result must be an integral matching across the parts. This is done as dating is not necessarily
a one to one relation and a man may date multiple women and a woman may date multiple men. We
do not require an integral matching as people may divide their time amongst those whom they are dating.
Furthermore the relaxation from ordinal preferences in classical SMP to cardinal preferences in
SFMP also maps more closely to the MM model. Here preferences are not given in a ranking but rather
by some expected transfer of utility. Because incel models are primarily concerned with
heterosexual relationships we assume that the [;M;] and [;W;] sets are bipartite and we will assume
wlog that [;|M| = |W|;] via the standard SMP reductions. We also assume that our cardinal preference
sets are full via the standard reductions.

## MM [;\leq;] SFMP

## Violation of incel assumptions

Now we seek to show a violation of incel assumptions in our SFMP model.

It is known that the classic Gale-Shapley algorithm for solving SMP does not give a truthful mechanism
for women and as shown above a coalition of men acting non-truthfully can improve the outcomes
of some men without hurting any other men. Thus we cannot rely upon properties of SMP and
Gale-Shapley to show a violation of the truthfulness assumption.

Because [;S\_m;] is taken as given, the women's only strategy is to modify [;S\_w;]. Thus it will
be sufficient to show that one woman cheating cannot improve her outcome.

#### Theorem
> Women cheating by misrepresenting their own signals will not improve their outcomes.

#### Proof

Clearly this violates the incel assumptions: if women act selfishly and deceitfully they are worse off
and yet we assumed that women are better off than men. These assumptions cannot all
hold in the given model and so we have a contradiction.

## Discussion and future work

There are some holes in the SFMP model that may be refined with future work.

The SFMP model does not account for the fact that there is a search cost not only to discovering
the vertices in the other part of the graph but also to discovering the distribution of values
gained from signals read from these vertices. Accounting for this and optimizing a search strategy
would likely involve utilizing a model such as a multiplicative weight updated resource distribution
or a regret minimization resource distribution model. This problem may also be considered as a prior
free optimization problem in the style of Devanur, Hartline, and Yan 2018 [2].

It should be noted that SFMP is hard and relaxing the stability constraint [;y;] by an
[;\varepsilon;] factor gives a [;1 / \varepsilon;] approximation in polynomial time, which is the best
possible if [;P \neq NP;]. It is unknown if these conclusions hold in the approximation case.

We have also restricted our functions on the domain of non-negative rational numbers due to the 
definition from Caragiannis, it is unknown if these results hold on the full set of real numbers.

Thankfully the other users in the thread (e.g. [1](https://np.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/f8814a/d_null_no_result_submissions/fijxp5k/), [2](https://np.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/f8814a/d_null_no_result_submissions/fil6b5n/)) did a good job in their replies, but I wanted to throw out a different perspective using simulation. Code is in R. 

Here are the libraries you'll need, and let's set a seed for reproducibility:

    library(DesignLibrary)
    library(tidyverse)
    set.seed(02202020)

Let's use `DesignLibrary` to generate 1,000 super straight-forward RCTs: n = 100,^1 equal probabilities of assignment to treatment and control groups, a control group mean of zero and standard deviation of 1, an ATE of 0.2, and the correlation between treatment and control outcomes is 1. Can't get any simpler than this!

    design <- expand_design(two_arm_designer, 
                         ate = 0.2, N = 100)

    simulations <- simulate_design(design, sims = 1000)

It's pretty easy to estimate our parameter of interest, 0.2, even without doing any fancy meta-analysis or anything like that.^2 [This is what our full distribution of studies will look like.](https://i.imgur.com/TQJPVYQ.png) The blue line is our estimate of the parameter of interest based on the data we observe, and the black line is its true value.

    mean(simulations$estimate)

    ggplot(simulations, aes(x=estimate)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 2/30) + 
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(estimate)), color=""blue"", linetype=""dashed"", size=1) +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 0.2), color=""black"", linetype=""dashed"", size=1) +
    labs(x=""Estimates"", y = ""Count"") 

So far so good... but wait, what happens if we do not report null results? The OP was unclear about what exactly they meant by negative results, so let's take two conceptualizations. 

First, suppose we only observe (publish) statistically significant results (p-value <= 0.05). What do you think will happen to our estimates? 

Well, it turns out we cannot estimate our parameter of interest without the full distribution of studies. [Here is what splitting up our distribution looks like in this case.](https://i.imgur.com/yB7tSjl.png) The mean of our ATEs from *only* the studies with a p-value <= of 0.05 is almost 0.5, represented by the red bars and the red dashed line, far greater than the true value of 0.2, represented by the black line. As an aside, unsurprisingly, the mean of our ATEs from *only* the ""unpublished"" studies is an underestimate of ~0.13, represented by the blue bars and the blue dashed line.

    sims_sig_bias <- simulations %>% mutate(filter = if_else(p.value < 0.05, ""Publication Bias"", ""Unpublished""))

    mean(sims_sig_bias[sims_sig_bias$filter == ""Publication Bias"",]$estimate)
    mean(sims_sig_bias[sims_sig_bias$filter == ""Unpublished"",]$estimate)

    ggplot(sims_sig_bias, aes(x=estimate, color=filter, fill = filter)) +
    geom_histogram(position=""dodge"") +
    geom_vline(data=sims_sig_bias, aes(xintercept=mean(sims_sig_bias[sims_sig_bias$filter == ""Publication Bias"",]$estimate)), color = ""red"", linetype=""dashed"") + 
    geom_vline(data=sims_sig_bias, aes(xintercept=mean(sims_sig_bias[sims_sig_bias$filter == ""Unpublished"",]$estimate)), color = ""blue"", linetype=""dashed"") +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept=0.2), color = ""black"", linetype=""dashed"") +
    labs(x=""Estimates"", y = ""Count"") + 
    theme(legend.position=""none"")

Now suppose we only observe/report/publish results with estimates that are bounded away from zero regardless of their statistical significance?^3 Will that solve the problem?

[As you might imagine: no.](https://i.imgur.com/dCPJp7F.png) Using only our ""published"" studies, our estimate of the parameter of interest is ~0.24, closer—but still an overestimate. The estimate using only the ""unpublished"" studies is wrong as well, of course: here we estimate close to a zero effect.

    sims_mag_bias <- simulations %>% mutate(filter = ifelse(estimate >= 0.1, ""Magnitude Bias"", ifelse(estimate <= -0.1,""Magnitude Bias"", ""Unpublished"")))

    mean(sims_mag_bias[sims_mag_bias$filter == ""Magnitude Bias"",]$estimate)
    mean(sims_mag_bias[sims_mag_bias$filter == ""Unpublished"",]$estimate)

What do we take away from this? We mostly all know that publishing *only* statistically significant results is bad, about p-hacking, about the replication crisis, etc. This is the point that I am responding to for the purposes of the RI (lots of people ignoring RIII recently!) Borrowing from [this blog post](https://declaredesign.org/blog/2019-01-08_significance_filter.html)—which inspired this post and is essentially another way to look at this same issue:

Two distinct problems arise if only significant results are published:

* The results of published studies will be biased towards larger magnitudes.
* The published studies will be unrepresentative of the distribution of true effects in the relevant population of studies.

But, as these simulations and the blog post also show, publishing *only* null results will lead to bias as well. It's best to not condition publication on results at all, so that we can observe the full distribution of studies.

544,fodkit,2020-03-24,badeconomics,"The cotton boycotts in Xinjiang are pointless - You can't boycott a fungible product, especially not cotton","[According to the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/western-companies-get-tangled-in-chinas-muslim-clampdown-11558017472), a major cotton mill in Xinjiang- Huafu Fashion has been using forced labor supplied by the Chinese government in Xinjiang. Huafu Fashion supplies a large number of well known brands such as Gap and Adidas with cotton and processed cotton products such as yarn.

&#x200B;

Huafu Fashion is a vertically integrated cotton company who owns a number of cotton farms and mills both inside and outside China. They supply a number of brands with raw cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton fabric. In Xinjiang, [Huafu Fashion operates a number of cotton farms](http://www.e-huafu.com/mobile/index_389.aspx) and factories producing cotton products.

&#x200B;

The press and consumers have [begun to pressure brands](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50312010) who have been implicated in doing business with Huafu Fashion, demanding that they boycott the company for using forced labor. Quickly popping over to /r/malefashionadvice shows that there exists quite a bit of outrage and that consumers believe that they should pressure their favorite brands into moving away from suppliers who have been implicated in employing forced labor.

&#x200B;

However, a closer examination of how the cotton industry operates would show that demanding your favorite brands to boycott suppliers who employ forced labor is economically pointless. Having a small handful of brands move away from a supplier due to their usage of forced labor isn't going to meaningfully impact the suppliers, nor provide serious disincentive for them to continue using forced labor.

&#x200B;

Now I’m here to discuss economics and supply chains here. I do understand that some people might find it morally appalling to personally wear clothing that contains cotton grown by companies with poor labor practices. In that case, pressuring your favorite brand to move away from suppliers implicated in labor scandals such as this one could possibly reduce the amount of cotton grown unethically in your clothing (however, even then it is highly unlikely, more on this below).

&#x200B;

Of course, I’m not in any way, shape, or form condoning forced labor. I am however, here to explain why boycotts do not noticeably harm the suppliers that use forced labor. Or in other words, I'm here to criticize slacktivism, as if writing a letter to your favorite designer is going to materially harm those benefiting from abusive labor practices and abhorrent policies.

&#x200B;

**What is a fungible good? Is cotton fungible?**

&#x200B;

A fungible good is a good that is essentially interchangeable. Every unit of this good is more or less the same as every other unit. The important thing to discuss of course, is the degree of fungibility. Cash is a perfectly fungible good, every bill or coin of the same denomination is the same. Some goods are also highly fungible, like gold or sugar. Other goods like clothing are significantly less fungible, GAP chinos and Levis jeans are not the same, and are not interchangeable. Therefore, pants are generally non-fungible. Of course, almost no good is perfectly fungible, and very few goods are perfectly non-fungible. After all, if you don’t care about appearance and only wear pants to avoid indecent exposure charges, pants are fungible to you.

&#x200B;

[The US Customs and Border Patrol defines fungible](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/nafta/guide-customs-procedures/other-instances-confer-origin/fungible-goods) as:

&#x200B;

>fungible goods are goods that are interchangeable for commercial purposes, and have essentially identical properties

&#x200B;

Because fungible products are literally interchangeable, for taxation and import reasons place there is no need to differentiate between place of origin:

&#x200B;

>When a producer mixes originating and non-originating fungible goods, so that physical identification of originating goods is impossible, the producer may determine origin of those goods based on any of the standard inventory accounting methods (e.g., FIFO, LIFO) specified in the Uniform Regulations. These provisions apply equally to fungible materials that are used in the production of a good.

&#x200B;

Here’s a good example provided by Customs and Border Patrol to illustrate:

&#x200B;

>Company Y of Mexico supplies clips to airplane manufacturers throughout North America. Some of the clips Y supplies originate in Mexico and others are made in China. All of the clips are of identical construction and are intermingled at Y's warehouse so that they are indistinguishable. On January 1, Company Y buys 3000 clips of Mexican origin; on January 3 it buys 1000 clips of Chinese origin. If Company Y elects FIFO inventory procedures, the first 3000 clips it uses to fill an order are considered Mexican, regardless of their actual origin.

&#x200B;

Or in other words, there’s a bin of clips, 3000 of which are from Mexico, 1000 of which are from China. If you go to your supplier and purchase 3000 Mexican clips, customs treats them all as Mexican clips, even if some of them are actually made in China. This is possible since the clips are fungible.

&#x200B;

Cotton is fungible. Sure, there are a variety of grades of cotton that trade at different prices, but cotton is a commodity that is publicly traded on the commodity markets, and to cotton buyers, different bales of cotton of the same grade are essentially identical.

&#x200B;

The US government’s official possible on Cotton is that it is a fungible product. And that one bale of cotton is like another. In 1955, when debating the Mutual Security Act of 1955, [it was argued that it is pointless to differentiate where cotton is from and who produced it](https://books.google.ca/books?id=wZ1OAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA231&lpg=PA231&dq=is+cotton+fungible&source=bl&ots=WHWWDHudn0&sig=ACfU3U2os-VWQBGzIM5s8jBNqfAoHZjjlg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiPyqSz-LPoAhWLZs0KHb9lAT4Q6AEwDHoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=is%20cotton%20fungible&f=false), because it is a fungible product.

&#x200B;

To take it one step further, its not like customers can differentiate between cotton from different suppliers. Cotton is very, very commonly mislabeled. The cotton industry trade group, the Better Cotton Initiative, [doesn't actually verify the physical origin of cotton](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/nov/19/egyptian-cotton-sheets-luxury-controversy-target-walmart). Instead, the cotton industry uses a “claim units” system to track cotton sourcing from different suppliers. Like clips in the example above, it doesn't matter who physically supplied the cotton, you can only advertise the cotton is from a supplier if you have the ""claim unit"" for it.

&#x200B;

Or in other words, imagine a yarn factory purchases cotton from two cotton farms, 3000 tons from supplier A and 3000 tons from supplier B. The yarn factory can treat the cotton as completely identical, store them in the same bin and everything, they have 3000 tons worth of claims from supplier A, and 3000 tons of claims from supplier B. A buyer can purchase 1500 tons of yarn made from Supplier A's cotton, and they'd get both the yarn and the claim units. The cotton in these 1500 tons don't have to physically be from supplier A, it could be from supplier B, after all, cotton is fungible.

&#x200B;

Now if a different buyer comes and says they want to purchase 4000 tons of yarn spun from supplier A's cotton, the yarn factory cannot fufill this order while complying with BCI's system, since although the yarn factory has 4500 tons of cotton left, and the cotton itself is identical, the yarn factory doesn't have enough claim units from supplier A to sell 4500 of yarn from supplier A's cotton.

&#x200B;

**Why is the Huafu Fashion boycott pointless?**

&#x200B;

As we’ve established earlier, Cotton is a fungible product. If you pressure your favorite brand to stop buying cotton from certain suppliers and switch to a different source, a different brand will buy the cotton instead.

&#x200B;

Let’s look at the state of Xinjiang's cotton industry. Xinjiang is a big producer of cotton, as it supplies around 84% of China’s cotton, and China produces around 22% of the world’s cotton. So we can calculate that Xinjiang produces a bit under a fifth of the world’s cotton.

&#x200B;

Xinjiang is home to a huge number of cotton farms. I cannot get the specific number of them in Xinjiang, but [according to the China Cotton Association](http://china-cotton.org/index/introDataList/1), there are 3400 cotton farming companies in China (a huge number of them must be in Xinjiang) and 24 million people in China farm cotton. Due to the sheer size of the overall cotton industry, forced laborers only comprise of a small percentage of the overall cotton growing workforce.

&#x200B;

When you pressure your favorite brand to boycott suppliers who have been caught using forced labor, your favorite brand might switch to a different supplier who adheres to more ethical employment standards. However, a different brand that doesn’t care will simply purchase the cotton instead, the companies that employ forced labor are fundamentally unharmed.

&#x200B;

Remember, the Xinjiang cotton market is a market with a lot of different buyers and a lot of different sellers. Supplier relationships are highly fluid, and large buyers routinely source from a number of constantly changing suppliers. This suggests to me that there exists little friction in switching between different cotton suppliers.

&#x200B;

When you write to your favorite brand, and demand that they boycott cotton from Huafu Fashion (or any other supplier implicated in a labor scandal), some other brand that doesn’t care will simply move in and purchase cotton from them instead.

&#x200B;

Remember how earlier I was talking about the claim units system? There's actually a very good chance that even if your favorite designer is refusing to purchase cotton from Huafu, their clothing still contains Huafu's physical cotton. After all, in cotton sourcing, the cotton is not physically tracked, it is the claim unit that is tracked.

&#x200B;

Imagine this scenario: you wrote to your favorite designer about boycotting Huafu. The clothing company then tells their supplier that they would no longer want fabric produced from Huafu's cotton.   However, the fabric factory is a large factory that processes cotton from a number of different cotton suppliers, one of which, is Huafu.

&#x200B;

If the fabric company doesn't physically separate the cotton from different suppliers, and just treats it as fungible, the cotton from all the different suppliers could be mixed up, and when the fabric factory sells the finished fabric to the clothing company, they could just attach claims units from a different supplier. So even though according to cotton industry tracing practices, you aren't getting Huafu's cotton, who knows really?

&#x200B;

**Edit 1: On how cotton is actually traded in Xinjiang.** 

&#x200B;

Ok, so I decided to dig into the specifics about cotton trading and look at how cotton changes hands in Xinjiang. There exists essentially two different ways of buying cotton, on exchange and off exchange. 

&#x200B;

Off exchange is pretty easy to understand: you call up the farm, you pull your truck up, hand over the money, and get the cotton. So where you get your cotton depends on which farm you source it from. Your BCI claim units come from the cotton farm itself if it is BCI certified. 

&#x200B;

On exchange, the system becomes very obfuscated. The exchange is called [the CNCE](http://www.cnce.cn/) (China National Cotton Exchange).  A cotton supplier can either hold onto the cotton in their own warehouse or ship the cotton to the exchange warehouse. 

&#x200B;

Buyers and sellers bid to determine the price of cotton on the cotton exchange. Today the market clearing price is 12450 RMB for a tonne of cotton. If you want to sell cotton, you get paid that amount per tonne, and if you want to buy cotton, you pay that amount per tonne (minus the cut the exchange gets). 

&#x200B;

But wait, what if you want BCI verified claim units of something like ""BCI verified Xinjiang cotton"" or something like that? Well remember how BCI and other cotton trading organizations treat cotton as fungible? Claim units are traded separately. 

&#x200B;

So think about it like this:

&#x200B;

A typical cotton supplier makes one kind of product: cotton. BCI certified cotton suppliers make two kinds of product, cotton and BCI claim units. 

&#x200B;

All cotton companies who decide to trade on exchange get the same market clearing price for cotton. Cotton companies who follow BCI production guidelines and get BCI claims then sell their BCI claims separately. 

&#x200B;

If you are a company that produces cotton ethically (both environmentally and labor relations), you can get BCI certified to produce BCI claims. However, only 14% of the world's cotton is BCI certified (and certification rates are much higher in areas where cotton is more mechanically produced). Certification rates in Xinjiang are much lower. 

&#x200B;

Assume at the exchange the market clearing price for cotton is $x/ton, and the price for BCI claim units are $y ton. A clothing company who doesn't care for how the cotton is produced will pay $x/ton for cotton. A clothing company who advertises that their cotton is produced ethically will pay $x+y/ton for cotton. 

&#x200B;

Similarly, a cotton farm that isn't BCI certified gets $x/ton per ton of cotton they sell. A cotton farm that is BCI certified gets $x+y/ton per ton of cotton. 

&#x200B;

Now here's the thing, [Huafu is BCI certified](http://www.e-huafu.com/pppj/index_305.aspx), but BCI certification is per cotton gin, and differs per facility. Assuming that BCI didn't just get bribed to look the other way, I'm assuming that Huafu's farms without forced labor are BCI certified, while Huafu's farms with forced labor are not. 

&#x200B;

Or to put it in mathematical terms: If Huafu produces A tons of cotton without forced labor (and BCI certified) and B tons of cotton with forced labor, assuming they sell the cotton on exchange, their revenue for cotton would be:

>(A + B)x + Ay

If Huafu used no forced labor, their total revenue will be:

>A(x+y)

&#x200B;

So as long as the exchange price of cotton is above Huafu's costs (which of course it will be, since Huafu is using forced labor, I assume it is a lot cheaper than their competitors). Forced labor will be profitable for them.

&#x200B;

**A market based solution to the forced labor issue:**

&#x200B;

A Market based solution could be possible under the current system if the demand for ethically produced cotton is so high, the value of cotton transfers to the BCI claim away from the raw cotton itself. 

&#x200B;

Again, assume cotton is $x/ton, and the price for BCI claim units are $y ton, there needs to be so much pressure on the price of cotton, that $x is below the production costs of cotton even with forced labor, and that ethical producers of cotton can turn a profit when they gain revenues of $(x+y)/ton.

545,e1o788,2019-11-25,badeconomics,"/r/politics cheers when economists say forgiving student loans would boost the economy. Which economists? What exactly did they say? Who cares, because the commenters don't.","Reddit post: https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/e1fmtm/economists_say_forgiving_student_debt_would_boost/

Original article: https://news.wgcu.org/post/economists-say-forgiving-student-debt-would-boost-economy

Headline:

> Economists Say Forgiving Student Debt Would Boost Economy

This was flaired with ""site altered headline"", since the original site headline is now slightly different:

> Forgiving Student Debt Would Boost Economy, Economists Say

The comment section of /r/politics is frothing at this news: *of course it would.  More spending money for ~~me~~ college graduates means more money spent in the economy = better economy.  Airtight.*  The comment section of the thread, sorted by top, is filled with these replies reiterating this point in many different ways, from more respectable but incomplete arguments that the transfer of wealth would be a net good, to individual anecdotes, down to the usual lopsided caricatures of reality.  Unfortunately, the article's headline is incredibly misleading.

I'm going to preface this with saying that I'm not an economist, so I'd appreciate any correction or addition to this.  I tried to avoid making strong blanket statements on certain topics, particularly the notion of home ownership and tax rates, because I don't want to open myself up for criticism on a point not relevant to the badecon taking place here.

***

The first problem with the article's headline is the ""economists"" themselves.  When I saw the headline, I thought ""interesting.  Which economists?""  Anyone with this attitude is, by now, used to disappointment; the article cites only two people.  One is [Lawrence Yun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Yun), currently the National Association of Realtors chief economist, and the other is [William Foster](https://events.moodys.io/moodys-speakers/foster-william-en), vice president of Moody's Investor Service, a credit rating agency.

Yun's talking points, at least as stated in the article, revolve entirely around how student loans affect home ownership.  Surprise: higher student loans means lower home ownership.  He also states that homeowners have a much higher net worth than renters.  *Shocking.*

The idea that owning a home builds wealth is pretty common, but observe that Yun's statements in the article don't touch anything not related to home ownership.  It's to be expected - he is representing a realtor's organization, so of course his concern is home ownership - but this needs to be kept in mind when discussing the issue of student loan forgiveness.  More important than all this, however, is the following tidbit (emphasis mine):

> **He's not endorsing any particular plan**, but he estimates that broad loan forgiveness would push up the number of home sales quite a bit.

He didn't even endorse the plans being lauded by the commenters of the article.  Who knows what statements he made about the downsides of student loan forgiveness, since the article isn't talking about them.  Yun's non-endorsement is touched on in one subordinate clause, but his points about the upsides of loan forgiveness span multiple paragraphs.  I tried googling his name and ""student loan forgiveness"" to find what his position might be on it more specifically, but all I found was the exact same article posted to at least 5 different outlets, with literally no changes between them.

Foster's points in the article about student loan forgiveness have a much larger breadth; he discusses how forgiving student loans would result in a massive boost in GDP.  He also states that forgiving student loans would let college graduates buy homes, and that owning a home is ""the most powerful way for most working and middle class people to build wealth.""

First, I want to take a moment to appreciate a large bit of irony: when I found this article on /r/all, I found it at the number 2 spot with about 18 and a half thousand upvotes.  Right above it, with over 21 thousand, was [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/e1gtlk/everything_is_not_fine_nobel_economist_calls_on/) article, with the usual sensationalist ""we need to rework the entire global economy"" comments.  Both those articles have almost doubled in upvote count since I found them, read the article, took a shower, and started typing this R1.  Go ahead and let that one sink in.  GDP is useless, until its growth is associated with something I like, in which case now it's a good thing.  I'm sure ""Reddit is not one person"" is a natural reply a lot of people have, but honestly at this point it's obvious that many Redditors latch to ideas they like first and bring the reasoning later.

Foster's first point is almost a tautology.  Of course forgiving student loans would increase GDP.  Debt payments from students don't count as an increase in GDP, but most likely whatever they would spend it on otherwise would.  GDP is not a perfect measurement (as Joseph Stiglitz, an actual Nobel economist, said in the other aforementioned article), and maximizing it without regards to whether what is being done to maximize it is not productive or useful.  Even worse is maximizing short term GDP without regards to long term GDP.  If forgiving student debt increases consumer spending now, but the taxes levied to make up the difference results in an end reduction in investment, will the GDP stay unaffected?  His second point about housing is a pretty common idea, but it's still a narrow view of the issue.  But Foster's apprehensions about student loan forgiveness aren't listed until the very end of the article, where he talks about, you know, the huge downsides to student loan forgiveness.  I'll go over this more in a bit.

The biggest takeaway anyone reading this should have is that when an article says ""experts say X"", there is a huge leeway as to who the experts are, what their focus is, and what they're actually saying.  In this case, they referred to two economists with arguably biased interests/perspectives, selectively took claims and quotes from them, and used them to imply that those people were making a point they weren't.  What should be represented as ""these two guys with some good insight believe that X plan has Y upsides but Z downsides, so be cautious"" was instead interpreted by tens of thousands of Redditors as ""pretty much all the experts agree that X is a fantastic plan and only the bad guys in the world don't want it so they can keep twirling their evil mustaches"".  I'm not an economist, so I'm not claiming that Yun or Foster are committing bad econ; I'm reserving my criticism for the article's author, its publishers, and the Reddit commenters going all in on the headline.

***

Now I want to talk more about the general idea of student loan forgiveness and its downsides.  Where should I begin?

Student loans aren't particularly special in their regards to increase GDP; almost **any** loan forgiveness is going to increase GDP, as long as the money that would otherwise be spent on those loans is spent in areas that are measured by GDP (e.g. consumer spending).  Forgiving (or buying, then forgiving) credit card debt, mortgages, car loans, loans for medical bills, business loans, or literally any other form of debt would increase GDP.  That doesn't automatically make it a good thing.  What does make student loan debt different is the sort of person who has it: college graduates make much higher income than non-graduates.  I mean, I can give you [1](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2017/high-school-graduates-who-work-full-time-had-median-weekly-earnings-of-718-in-second-quarter.htm) [2](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/) [3](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/research-summaries/education-earnings.html) sources for this, but honestly why bother.  This is common knowledge; people who graduate from college make more than those who don't.  A wealth transfer towards some of America's highest earners is not really necessary; if you're so concerned with stopping the robber barons and billionaire class from exploiting the poor, why not cancel credit card debt instead?  People choose to go into debt to go to college as opposed to working right out of high school or going to trade school, but often times people in credit card debt were in unfortunate scenarios in life where they felt they had no other option.  Cancelling car loans would probably help millions of people who rely on it to get to their job, with some of those people living paycheck to paycheck.  It's quite likely that, if you're so concerned with increasing GDP, the people who would benefit from these earn less money, and these people have a higher [marginal propensity to consume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_propensity_to_consume).  College graduates with a sudden extra amount of income are more likely to invest it.  These sorts of investments, ironically, are painted as unproductive or even exploitative in the comment section of the article.

There are a number of potential replies to this, so I'd like to touch on them:

* *There aren't big downsides to student loan forgiveness.  Creditors are wealthy already, and don't need the money; college graduates do.*

 Student loans are a source of income for the government and are an asset owned.  [There is over $1.5 trillion of federal student debt](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=SLOAS,#0); if you were to forgive this whole amount in one go, you would greatly increase the deficit.  Even if the government can print money and levy taxes, it cannot do so without consequences: you can't ignore the deficit with the reasoning that ""it's the government, so it's OK"".  Is it different?  Certainly, but that doesn't mean you can just flat out not care.  If you're thinking that we should tax the rich to pay for it or that college should be free anyway, see the points below.

* *College should be free in the first place.*

 * Education does not grow on trees - it is expensive for a reason.  Educating someone is resource intensive.  If you make something like that free, the resource becomes over-utilized.  Imagine if the government paid everyone's gas bill.  You know what would happen?  Cars would pack the roads, we'd run out of gas, and ironically, people not well off enough to afford a car gain nothing from it.  Massive forgiveness of student loans encourage more people to take out student loans, and making college free encourages everyone to go, even if they don't need to or shouldn't.  Not everyone needs to be college educated.

 * Something being paid for by the government isn't free with no asterisks - it has to be paid for somehow.  The methods of paying for it would all require, in one form or another, much higher taxes, and while those taxes can be distributed in a number of ways, there isn't a way of doing it without negative consequences.  The question becomes whether the tax combined with free college is a net good or not.

 Observe that neither of these points is a rejection of the idea that the government should subsidize education, college or otherwise.  It's just stating the fact that it is not free, and trying to reduce the cost too far will result in over-utilization.

**EDIT**: I'm way late with this, but I should say this particular bullet point was not thought out well.  There are countries that have free higher education and make it work, so my implication that free college is economically bad was mistaken.  I will leave it unedited, though, as the main point wasn't so much about tuition-free college as about what ""free"" means and the potential consequences.  I apologize for this - especially the vague claim about ""over-utilization"" - but I think the point of this section, as well as the rest of the R1, still stands.


* *The super-wealthy should be taxed to pay for universal college.*

 Progressive tax rates are a pretty common idea, but like anything it can go overboard.  The richest Americans don't store their income in giant piles of cash that sit around and collect dust; they're stored in assets and investments.  If the wealthy are taxed too much, it reduces the investment made in the economy and consequently reduces job and economic opportunities - or alternatively, it leads to them simply moving abroad.  I understand that this sounds eerily similar to ""trickle down economics"", which is not what I'm advocating - higher income brackets should certainly have higher tax rates.  But that doesn't make them an infinite pile of cash just waiting to be taxed for whatever you'd like.  Budget plans still need to be grounded in reality.

***

The biggest irony in this whole situation is that the middle class and above are the ones who have to gain from this sort of policy, and not America's poorest.  Think about the sort of person saddled with car payments or credit card debt.  Some of them, naturally, might just be people who had money but made poor decisions.  However, a lot of those people are lower class workers who need their cars to go to work, or needed to go into debt to put food on the table.  Why not buy this debt from creditors and forgive that instead?  You could argue it would result in better off people taking advantage of it, but how couldn't this argument be given to the stereotypical liberal arts major, who got a degree before thinking about how they would pay for it?  At the end of the day, it's rent seeking, plain and simple.  It's a transfer of wealth from taxpayers to a specific group that already has higher income prospects.

Many of these people might justify themselves by proclaiming that they support a UBI or universal healthcare as well, but that just adds to the question as to how on Earth they intend to pay for those on top of this program.  Do you really think everyone richer than you is just a giant bag of money that can be mined through the government with no consequence?

I'd like to go through some of the comments on the article now, to see how this headline was discussed.  It's mostly just a repetition of the above ideas, strung together.  The [top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/e1fmtm/economists_say_forgiving_student_debt_would_boost/f8ord4m/):

> The middle class having more money means they will spend more money.  The super rich having more money means they will have a bigger balance in their savings account...

Again, they don't have giant savings accounts just sitting with gold coins to swim through.  They invest them, which are converted to job opportunities or economic enterprises.  Besides, you want more spending money in the economy, lower class Americans have a higher MPS - you should favor a program that benefits them and not college graduates.  The [top reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/e1fmtm/economists_say_forgiving_student_debt_would_boost/f8osis4/) to this comment is even worse:

> It’s really worse than that if you think about it.  Middle and lower income people will recirculate the money.  Rich people use the money to buy more of our collective resources and then profit off of them. It actually makes the problem worse every time we do this. They’re not “hoarding the money,” they’re hoarding what they buy with the money, which is the means of production.

This person is trying to conflate middle and lower income earners as much as possible.  Beyond this, wasn't one of the article's biggest arguments for debt forgiveness to promote home ownership?  You know, to build wealth over time?  What was that called again?  ""We don't want the super rich investing because it's just going to lead them to steal from our labor - *we* should be the investors instead.""  And if you genuinely believe that the concept of an investment as a whole is a scam that should be done away with by way of dismantling the entire economy and basing it on one that has failed every time it's been tried, I'm afraid the refutation of this is outside of the scope of this R1.

Here's another [broken window](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/e1fmtm/economists_say_forgiving_student_debt_would_boost/f8os04t/):

> Things I would do if student loans were forgiven and Medicare for All was adopted: Hire someone to clean my house. Hire someone to mow my lawn. Hire someone to fix my basement. Hire someone to add a second bathroom.  Notice a trend?

 I do notice a trend.  You'd use the money you now have to hire people for luxury services like cleaning and lawn mowing that might otherwise be hired by someone else instead.  But it's fine, because it's *you* who gets to have the nice things.

Many of the other top comments are, predictably, either [anecdotes of how it would help them](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/e1fmtm/economists_say_forgiving_student_debt_would_boost/f8ons15/), [reductive jokes](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/e1fmtm/economists_say_forgiving_student_debt_would_boost/f8onhjx/), and your typical generational conflict comments ranting about boomers.  I just think it's sad to see so many people from a purportedly smarter and more rational part of society justify blatant rent seeking when it benefits them.  Part of my bias might come from the fact that I am from the bay area, where a $1 million house is quite cheap, but seeing people rant about billionaires so much when they're trying to buy a house - already a sign that you are well off - just reeks of hypocrisy.",bromeatmeco,t2_eq4se,0.92,1065,274

[The main problem is that a UBI of only $12k/year is prohibitively expensive and would suck up 70% of the US budget.](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-06-06/universal-basic-income-is-ahead-of-its-time-to-say-the-least) Of course there are some savings, since we could eliminate social security, and move medicare to premium support, since after all the UBI was supposed to replace all other forms of social welfare. And keep in mind, this is for a UBI of only $12k/year which is less than what social security currently pays to the average retiree. A more ""reasonable"" UBI of $20k/year (and a Brazzers subscription included) would consume 116% of the national budget.

Of course I haven't addressed his point yet about cutting back other expenditures. Let's look at hypothetically implementing UBI in the country of Denmark, which is near the revenue maximizing point of the Laffer Curve. According to Bernie Sanders it's socialist utopia with all the high taxes, high spending, and low corporate welfare an American liberal could want. (Denmark actually very neoliberal but that's beside the point) [Denmark taxes 48% of GDP per year, compared to 25% in the US.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending#As_a_percentage_of_GDP) [A UBI equivalent of $20k/year per person in Denmark would consume 90% of all tax revenues.](https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm). Remember, that implementing such a UBI would involve cancelling all public pensions, social security, government health care programs, with just 10% of tax revenues left to spend on the military, schools, roads, courts, prisons and other vital government functions.

>Victim blaming, and taking a ""we know best"" approach is terrifying. They are openly insisting that they know what people need better then the people who are asking for what they need. Piling on the mentally ill, and drug addicted is adorable, given that they've done literally nothing to resolve these issues in the first place. Using it as an example for why a policy which might actually help them would actually fail them is out of touch, at best, and maliciously psychotic, which is more likely.

Now we arrive at the big question: are economists maliciously psychotic shills or just out of touch hentai-connoisseurs? No just kidding: [would giving unconditional cash payments to drug addicts, the mentally ill, and the homeless generate long term benefits for their ](http://www.drugandalcoholdependence.com/article/S0376-8716(09\)00050-7/abstract?cc=y=)welfare? And conversely, [would offering conditional cash payments (on work, treatment etc.) promote greater welfare gains?](http://www.bmj.com/content/315/7110/703.short) 

The first study was a RCT between cocaine users and sober individuals. The first part of the experiment demonstrated that when given unconditional cash payments (the participation payment) the cocaine users performed much worse. The second part of the experiment demonstrated that when given cash incentives to perform well, the cocaine users performed better than the sober individuals. In the second study I cite, patients who were paid to comply with medical treatment were more likely to comply in 90% of the literature reviewed. Therefore, giving unconditional cash payments to the drug-addicted is probably worse than giving payments conditional on treatment.

>P.S. I upvoted this article because people need to see how insane the wealthy pornstars have become. They are not capable of responding rationally. This is the face of your society. Irrational nutjobs with more wealth then sense.

[The wages of Brookings Senior Fellows are about $100k/year](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Brookings-Institution-Salaries-E21334.htm). That hardly qualifies as uber-wealthy. Also the irony is definitely lost on OP after he accuses his opponents of being irrational, sociopathic shills when presented with a reasoned argument against his beliefs.

BONUS:

>I read the top response and all the others they were a big bunch of BS. And none of them addressed the essential problem that economics is going to have to solve and our current system will crash and burn if we don't solve it. That would be that according to the latest oxford study in the US alone 47% of jobs are going to be automated away over the next twenty years. That's an underestimate, because that doesn't consider knock on effects like the jobs that depend on the jobs that were automated, like cleaning out the semen of sex robots that replace prostitutes. It also doesn't include the effect of globalization either. So I would say unemployment is going to be much higher than 47% maybe even a little higher than 50% by the end of the next 20 years. The great depression happened when we had around 30% unemployment. If you would like to argue that new jobs will replace these jobs then I challenge you to tell me where these jobs will come from and how the average joe will get them. I'd also like you to keep in mind that over 90% of the jobs available today are the same jobs available 100 years ago.

Highlights:

* Predicts greater than 50% unemployment due to automation
* Declares jobs lost to automation won't be balanced out by new jobs created through efficiency gains. Worse, suggests automation will actually destroy existing jobs further down the supply chain.
* Asserts that 90% of current jobs existed in an essentially unchanged form 100 years ago.

Someone showed me [this tweet](https://twitter.com/ExogenyKarl/status/1400627529598353408) that links to a substack post screeching about wokeism at the Fed. [This is an astonishingly bad article](https://archive.is/wucdE). It is greatly depressing that some of my friends who do not study economics took this article seriously. 

He's complaining about the [New York Fed's current web page](https://www.newyorkfed.org/) ([archived version](https://archive.is/QFIw5)). 

Its long and rambley but this paragraph summarizes his main thesis:

>This then begs the question: what happens when such crypto-communism is allowed to creep into our once hallowed institutions? **What happens when Marxists become our central bankers? The financial system loses all credibility and crumbles**, of course. Trust and independence must be earned by meritocracy, competence, and institutional restraint; they are pissing it away for nothing, save for some warm fuzzy feelings. **Stuff like this has absolutely destroyed the credibility of other countries many times over**, and **if the U.S. stays on this path, I am not sure how the IMF can credibly advocate for monetary independence overseas**. You tell them to stop giving political handouts to political clientele, they'll just point to America and say you're doing exactly the same thing. **The end game here is that USD will fall, the empire implodes, and Chicago becomes Chengdu. China is laughing at you**.


So China is going to invade Chicago or something because the Federal Reserve Bank of New York decided to say that racism is bad. Aight. Lets get this R1 started.

He has a bunch of issues with the web page. He starts out with complaining that there's nothing about monetary policy on the page:

>Navigate to newyorkfed.org, and rather than anything relating to monetary policy, you will be met with the following [impenetrable statement](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/images/v4/home_page/featured_photo/speical-nyfed-statement-fp.jpg?h=640&w=1280&la=en) front-and-center on the landing page

But there are things related to monetary policy. You don't even need to scroll down for this. [There are 3 different monetary policy announcements right there](https://imgur.com/d683YcX). First one is about [winding down an emergency lending facility](https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/markets/2021/20210603). Second one is announcing [a specific kind of open market operation for treasuries](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_210527). Third is about an [open market operation for mortgage backed securities](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_210525). To be fair, most people do not know how monetary policy is conducted in the United States beyond ""its when the Fed buys and sells bonds"" but given the qualifications in his twitter bio I feel like he should have been able to identify these announcements as monetary policy related based on the titles alone.^1 
 
Okay I'm being snarky right now I know he probably didn't mean that literally. But this is related to another point he brings up about the Fed's mission:

> By extending their dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment to a triple mandate (“no more white males!”), the Fed has made the fatal mistake of falling for mission creep: the gradual or incremental expansion of an intervention, project or mission, beyond its original scope, focus or goals. 

Basically he thinks that the Fed making [this statement](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/images/v4/home_page/featured_photo/speical-nyfed-statement-fp.jpg?h=640&w=1280&la=en) about racism is somehow extending the Fed's original mission. But its not. Monetary policy is an important part of the Fed's mission yes. But the Fed does other things as well. It is an important financial regulator and it is also a very important *research institution*. If you do not understand how the Fed in its capacity as a research institution can help us ""understand and find solutions to the numerous forms of inequality that communities of color experience"" then just click on the link to the [""Economic Inequality"" research series](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/heterogeneity-series) that's right next to the statement he's complaining about. The Fed's relationship with banks all across the nation puts it in an ideal position to conduct research like [this for example](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2021/05/who-benefited-from-ppp-loans-by-fintech-lenders.html) which is about how well PPP loans issued by fintech lenders reached minority communities. 

The point I'm trying to make here is that this is just the New York Fed exercising academic free speech. There is a fundamental contradiction in this post. He's fearmongering about cancel culture curtailing speech when all the Fed is doing is conducting research related to racial discrimination. The Fed is uniquely capable of conducting certain kinds of research and that includes much more than monetary policy. 

Moving on. 

>Why have we allowed this mission creep to occur? The most obvious, and mostly correct answer, is that — fueled by a Democratic Whitehouse and vindictive anti-Trump backlash — the political zeitgeist demands it. 

The Economic Inequality research series actually started in October 2019 - during the Trump administration. I tried to find a primary source for the main statement that he's spending a ton of time writing about but the best I can find is [this Facebook post from June 2020](https://www.facebook.com/newyorkfed/photos/1706795382794199/). Also during the Trump administration. I could also point out that the Federal Reserve Banks are pretty independent from the president and not under Joe Biden's direct control but whatever. 

>An even simpler explanation might be that Central bankers have big egos and like to feel important; interest rates have been stuck at zero for the past decade, they are sitting in their cubicles with their thumbs up their collective asses, and so they sought out new powers out of some misguided notion of needing to feel useful.

Vulgar Keynesian/MMT nonsense. [Monetary policy remains effective at the ZLB](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/g78bho/the_single_family_homes_sticky_24_april_2020/foti6t2/). Maybe not as effective but its not like the Fed is sitting around looking for things to do. 

The article goes on to point at other pieces of evidence because I guess he was done milking this one statement for so long. I don't really care to engage this its just twitter threads by Caudia Sahm and Doleac and also some blog posts. What I do want to engage is this weird attack on Lisa Cook because its actually something of substance. The Biden administration is talking about nominating Lisa for the Board of Governors. Chris has an issue with this:

> So, who is Lisa Cook? Just a random economist at Michigan State University who has shamelessly leveraged her skin color and genitalia into gaining the backing of several key White House officials as the probable choice for President Joe Biden’s next nominee for an open seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Just how unqualified is she? Glad you asked. **Please go look at her [CV yourself](https://lisadcook.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Revised-CV-PDF-Edits-0521.pdf), which shows that based on merit she's not even qualified to be a visiting staff economist at the Fed, let alone serve on the Board of Governors**... She’s not even a macroeconomist! This isn’t her area!

Lets take a look at that CV. 

- She has a PhD from UC Berkeley. [Literally a T5 grad school](https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.econdept.html). Senior economist at the CEA and the Treasury department. Professor at MSU. That's #31 on the same rankings list. This is a ton of experience.
- Based on education alone she is already more qualified than 4 current members of the Board of Governors **including the current Fed Chair**:

- She has published more papers than I care to count right now. 
- Chris claims she's not a macro-economist. Her research does seem mostly focused on discrimination and cliometrics. But I can identify at least 5 papers here about fiscal policy during recessions, finance, and more specifically financial crises. Does finance count as macro? I mean sometimes yea I'd say so. But even if its not macro, its certainly relevant research for the Federal Reserve. Financial regulation also matters. 
- Eichengreen was her Phd advisor and he's based as fuck. 

I spent like 3 hours writing this thing and I feel gross for engaging with it in good faith.

549,xqmtac,2022-09-28,badeconomics,The Poverty Rate Was Not 50% in 2014,"Hello, I have returned, this time with an actual somewhat serious post instead of 10k words of rambling about Gandalf's weaponry collection. 

I just finished reading through *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism* and am, frankly, unimpressed. I thought the book generally was [poorly argued and had a loose relationship with fact](https://featherlessbipeds.substack.com/p/no-google-isnt-literally-stealing). This was relatively surprising because of the praise it has received:

The Guardian thinks that *Surveillance Capitalism* is the “first definitive account of the economic…condition of our age.” The Financial Times thinks it’s a “masterwork of original thinking and research.” It received positive reviews in The New York Times, The Intercept, The New York Review, The New Statesman, The LA Review of Books, and the Wall Street Journal. It is blurbed by an extraordinary amount of luminaries. Zadie Smith thinks it's the most important book published this century. It merely made the Guardian’s list of the top 100 books this century — admittedly, this was a weird list, including a Young Adult novel that bravely asks the question “What if white people were discriminated against instead?” Perhaps *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism’*s most impressive achievement is that it topped the list of Barack Obama’s best books of 2019, despite the book's own scorching indictment of the Obama Whitehouse’s relationship with Google. 

I'm not going to go into all the details because the issues I had with it go beyond just economic facts and quite a few are normative rather than positive, but it is worth highlighting several positive claims the book makes about the economy that are suspect.

&#x200B;

**I. Debatably false claim that 30% of people in the UK are excluded from routine social participation** 

The author writes that “Research in the UK showed that by 2013, poverty fueled by lack of education and unemployment already excluded nearly a third of the population from routine social participation.” 

Having checked the study she cites (while I am all for making fun of the British economy) that is not what it says. The study, in fact, does find a negative relationship between income and social participation, except for the bottom third of the income distribution, where it is essentially flat (except for the poorest, who, oddly, have a slightly higher rate of participation). The study makes no finding about the causes of poverty (i.e. that education and lack of jobs are the reason) and makes no finding that the bottom third are entirely excluded from routine participation (indeed the word routine does not appear in the study and the operationalization of social participation is through religious participation, political mobilization, and a  neighboring index that includes measures of attitudes like ""a willingness to ask for advice from someone in the neighbourhood"" noneof these are necessarily ""routine"") merely that they all share a reduced level of participation. 

To be fair, the statement just says that they are excluded, not that they are entirely excluded, but conjoining it with the word routine does seem to suggest that the participation levels are near zero, [which is not the case](https://imgur.com/a/UApA5wB)

*The Study Cited:*

“Emanuele Ferragina, Mark Tomlinson, and Robert Walker, “Poverty, Participation and Choice,” JRF, May 28, 2013, 

 [https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/poverty-participation-and-choice](https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/poverty-participation-and-choice)

**II. The US Poverty Rate was \~50% in 2014**

The Author argues that “By 2014 nearly half of the US population lived in functional poverty, with the highest wage in the bottom half of earners at about $34,000.” The author cites two reports on this. Both reports place the poverty rate at \~14% using multiple different measures of poverty, that is not nearly half.

Of course, Zuboff is slightly hedging here by qualifying it as “functional” poverty. I still don’t think we can arrive at an interpretation of this as true. The share of Americans who have an income that is double the poverty line is still way under 50%, per her own citations. A further oddity is that the reason Zuboff brings up this fact is to decry the disintegration of the social safety net. But, transfer payments and in-kind benefits, notably, are not captured in wage measurements, making that 34,000 wage number not necessarily the one you would want to look at. 

Additionally, I can't actually seem to find the 34,000 wage number in either study she cited, but maybe I am just missing it.

**III. Google is not subject to legal constraints**

The Author claims, in reference to Google, that “No moral, legal, or social constraints will stand in the way of finding, claiming, and analyzing others’ behavior for commercial purposes.”

Assuming that one considers financial penalties an impediment to one's way, laws have stood in Google's way at several points, here are two:

**IV. China does not use economic data to send people to reeduction camps**

The Author, in reference to the Judgement Defaulter's List used by the government to track failure to repay debt in China writes that ""“No one is sent to a reeducation camp, but they may not be allowed to purchase luxury goods. ”

This is misleading as the Chinese government is currently using predictive data analytics that include banking records to send members of minority populations to reduction camps [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/china-using-big-data-to-detain-people-in-re-education-before-crime-committed-report/article38126551/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/china-using-big-data-to-detain-people-in-re-education-before-crime-committed-report/article38126551/)

The article we're going to look at today is *[""Expansion and Ascription: Trends in Educational Opportunity in Canada, 1920–1994""](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2387073)* by Wanner (1999).

**RI:** A sociologist wrote it

That's it for this week! Next week we'll be showing why empirical results are too feeble to effectively disprove a priori theorems derived from undeniably true axioms.

...

...

...

...

...

...You're still here?

Well shit, I guess I'll have to give it a serious go. In his article, Wanner pores over a large dataset from Canadian surveys to test if parent's socioeconomic status, gender, first language spoken (remember this is Canada) are predictive of ""how deep"" into the education system a child will go (using OLS and logit models). 

The paper might be in a Sociologists' review, but it's effectively econometrics and the findings are important because they act as evidence of the educational system's effectiveness at helping economic mobility.

Wanner follows the sociologist Mare's (1981) model where each level of education is seen as a ""stage"", and students will decide using a cost benefit analysis at each level if they should continue with their education.

The paper finds that gender and language inequality in education have been practically eliminated in the 20th century, but that economic class inequality in education persisted, despite massive investment in the Canadian education infrastructure.

Importantly, the paper finds results that agree on all counts with an important study by Shavit and Blossfeld in 1993, which find there is no trend in the effect of socio-economic background on higher education. 

As levels of education increase in the model, there's a steep decline in the ""mother's status"" and ""father's status"" predictors' values in the regression. 

While rich parents' kids will pass high school more often, they're not going to grad school much more than poor kids. Not to repeat myself, but these findings are important as far as policy recommendations go, because they obliquely imply that the investment in higher education infrastructure is inefficient. 

**RI:** This paper might have been given a pass, except for the fact that it was written in 1999 and James Heckman and Stephen Cameron wrote [this](http://athens.src.uchicago.edu/jenni/econ312_2003/Life_Cycle_1998.pdf) masterpiece of a paper in 1998. The Heckman paper is about unobserved differences in the Mare model we talked about above.

To explain this, lets assume the Mare sequential model where at each level of education you're faced with the decision of working your way to the next level or not. You make a cost benefit analysis taking into account not only the value you will get from subsequent education, but also the likelihood you will pass the next level of education. 
This likelihood we can refer to as a student's ability (or motivation), which a student can observe but the researcher obviously can't. What Cameron and Heckman show is that not accounting for this unobservable variable causes omitted variable bias and invalidates the results of your regression.

In simple terms, the deeper level of education we look into, the more we get a sample that self selected for higher ability. People who know they don't have the ability to go for a certain level of education likely won't attempt it. So the result that Wanner(1999) and Shavit and Blossfeld's (1993) found where the predictors decline in value as the level of education increase is entirely explainable by the unobserved ability variable (which increases with level of education and corrects for self selection bias).

As such, Wanner's article above gets the official stamp of BadEconomics.",VodkaHaze,t2_89d6j,0.94,32,16
552,5yimtf,2017-03-10,badeconomics,Bad Controls: The Controllening (with math!),"We have debated the issue with ""bad controls"" in the past, and today's post on GWG reminded me of the topic. This is not really an RI, but I've been working through a parametric example / model of bad control to better understand the problem, and I figured maybe it could be of interest to others, although it's somewhat technical. Hopefully the mods won't mind too much. Alternatively you could say I'm RIing myself (slightly).

(tagging /u/besttrousers and /u/commentsrus who may be interested)

The model is inspired by [Montgomery et al. (2016)](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/post-treatment-bias.pdf), who also have some further references to the literature on bad controls (apparently this topic is known in other fields as post-treatment bias). Compared to them, I'm using continuous rather than binary variables and different notation.

So imagine the following statistical model:

* T is a binary 0/1 random variable, ε and η are random normal shocks

* T, ε, η are mutually independent, exogenous and everything

* outcome y is given by y = β{y,0} + β{y,T} * T + β{y,x} * x + ε

* covariate x is given by x = β{x,0} + β{x,T} * T + β{x,ε} * ε + η

Interpretation: betas are coefficients. T is a randomized binary treatment (say, teaching randomly chosen coal-miners programming). An outcome y (e.g. earnings after some period) depends on treatment T, unobserved ""skill"" ε (could stand for intelligence or motivation) but also on some additional covariate x (e.g. how much time does the coal-miner spend on self-study after taking the course). The covariate in turn can also depend on treatment, skill and some orthogonal idiosyncratic shock η. We may expect that taking the course makes one more likely to study programming also in free time, but also that those with higher skill will be more likely to self study.

The model is not cast directly into a potential outcome framework, but hopefully we can agree on how to define the causal effect of treatment on outcome:

* β{y,T} is ""partial"" causal effect, i.e. change in earnings if we had the person take the course but kept self-study time fixed

* β{y,T} + β{y,x} * β{x,T} is ""composite"" causal effect, i.e. overall change in earnings caused by taking the course, including the effect of increase in self-study

Which is the ""true"" causal effect? It really depends on what we care about. Sometimes it's the overall effect that matters, but  we may be also interested in the partial effect (after all, if the whole effect of the course worked through motivating workers to study on their own, maybe there are cheaper ways to do that).

Moving on to the main result, let's say we have large data sample with observations on (y, x, T). What will we estimate when we regress y on T (and intercept)? And what happens when we regress y on both x and T?

* regressing on T and intercept only, the coefficient on treatment will be (in plim sense) equal to β{y,T} + β{y,x} * β{x,T}

* regressing on T, x and intercept, the coefficient on treatment will be β{y,T} - β{x,T} * (β{x,ε} * Var[ε]) / (β{x,ε}^2 * Var[ε] + Var[η])

(~~I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which reddit is too narrow to contain.~~ Simulations seem to confirm. Proof is left as an exercise for the dear reader.)

What these nasty math formulas mean is that:

* regressing on T only will correctly estimate the composite effect (after all, T was randomized)

* regressing on both x and T will *not* correctly estimate the partial effect if β{x,T}!=0 and β{x,ε}!=0 (essentially, X is endogenous, and if correlated with T, endogeneity will contaminate also estimate of coefficient on T). It would however estimate the partial effect consistently if either β{x,T}=0 or β{x,ε}=0.

To sum up: bad control problem is legit in the sense that even if we want to estimate the partial causal effect, adding more controls will not correctly estimate it if those controls are themselves affected by treatment and endogenous. Neither is there guarantee that it will give us closer estimate that the composite effect, since the bias and its sign depends on several coefficients.

OTOH, if we truly want the partial causal effect (like if we want to isolate pure discrimination component of GWG), not controlling for covariates is not the answer either. The correct solution would be to instrument for x, but that's easier said than done.

Four months ago, a user asked r/Physics about whether or not they looked down upon economics, given that in his experience at a Spanish university, it was the case that physicists dismissed economics as something easy and trivial.

While some responses were both respectful and insightful, there were unfortunately many others that did not exactly have such characteristics.

**Economics is a BS discipline that is not actually a science**

>The previous commenters who said physicists and mathematicians laugh at economists a bit because their models are total bullshit and get to make all kinds of assumptions to arrive at a model that has no basis in reality is pretty spot on. The fact that is actually true about economics demonstrates why it’s less rigorous than physics or math (or biology, chemistry). The hard sciences cannot just take random things as assumptions, everything that is assumed must be observable or demonstrable in experiments and explained by a theory (and for physics, a set of equations). Math has to PROVE everything via deductive reasoning.

I challenge the user to name one basic tenet of economics that is not supported by empirical evidence.

>It’s fairly obvious that the first principles of economics have not been flushed out because no one can create an economic model that actually predicts markets or economies of scale any better than flipping a coin.

Basic supply and demand along with industrial organization, game theory, etc., go a long way in explaining market structures/outcomes.

>It’s not treated like a hard science because politics interferes with it and injects it’s bullshit into it constantly. We’re getting to the point now where politics is injecting its bullshit into everything, including the social sciences and biology via the pharmaceutical and medical care industries. If it starts happening more frequently and make it’s way into physics and math, it will strangle progress there just like it had in economics.

The assertion that politics has not influenced the hard sciences at all is quite difficult to defend when one considers history and current events.

As for the claim that progress has been strangled in economics, it encourage the user to read the [latest research highlights](https://www.aeaweb.org/research) released by the American Economic Association. They can be quite insightful!

>One of the reasons economics gets crap is because some of it is earned. Classic Chicago School econ is less and less supported by evidence, with behavioural econ getting much more play. Yet despite example after example where behavioural economics explains how people actually act as economic agents, there are still.people who hold Chicago School perspectives as the truth. It'd be like being a physicist that didn't support relativity or QM because they were in the Newton School.

For one, I am assuming that they mean neoclassical economics, and perhaps specifically rational choice theory since they are comparing it to behavioral economics. Schools of economic thought such as the Chicago School of economics are not really a thing anymore.

Next, while it is true that behavioral economics sometimes does better at modeling economic behavior  than rational choice theory, it is the case that for much of the time, rational choice theory is still adequate at explaining the decisions of economic agents.

Simply dismissing rational choice theory just because behavioral economics is sometimes ""better"" would be akin to throwing out Newtonian physics because of general relativity and quantum mechanics.

>Physics is the Queen of sciences because enough time and money can resolve theories completely. Economics is the dismal science because it's experiments cannot be repeated, leaving many competing theories unresolved.

Although it is unfortunately not as common as it should be, [replication](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20171031) does indeed occur in the field of economics.

It should also be noted that economics was originally called the ""dismal science"" by Thomas Carlyle, a 19th-century pro-slavery writer who expressed dismay at the fact that political economy often led to conclusions against the institution of slavery.

T**he Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences is not a** ***real*** **Nobel Prize**

>Ah do you mean the propaganda award (Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences) that economists have concocted to look like science.

The award was created by the Sveriges Riksbank in commemoration of the central bank's 300th anniversary, not by an international cabal of economists conspiring to gain legitimacy.

>Not even that, the prize is, like most things in economics, simply crude capitalist/neoliberal propaganda. Economists made up this fake Nobel Prize to look like science.

The majority of Nobel Prize winners have won for ideas/thoughts that are not exactly associated with ""capitalist/neoliberal"" ideology. Their claim is just as ridiculous as Peter Nobel asserting that two-thirds of the winners have gone to stock market speculators.

**Economists are neoliberal hacks who support the economic status quo**

>Capitalist apologists who firmly believe in the red scare propaganda and consider the ""Free"" Market to be an infallible supreme being.Moreover, they consider Marx either the devil himself or simply an idiot. Of course without ever having read a single sentence of his texts.But the most important thing is that they think capitalism is the best possible economic system. For them the history of mankind has ended with capitalism. People who completely seriously believe the unbelievable bullshit of Francis Fukuyama, Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek or Ludwig von Mises and think that it is the greatest wisdom. Oh and not to forget that they hate and fear socialism/communism/Marxism with religious fanaticism. Other economists are as rare as unicorns.

Economists are perfectly willing to accept that market policies are not always optimal while also not letting Marx live rent free in their heads.

And out of those four figures, practically none of them are ""worshipped"" by economists, with only some of Friedman and Hayek's ideas still being seen as relevant (and Friedman much more so than Hayek).

Also, I have the strange feeling that the user thinks about socialism much more than economists do...

>Pretty much everything about economics is political, whether economists deny it or not. Economic models are usually presented as apolitical to hide the fact that they are highly ideological. For example, increasing unemployment is advocated by most economists to fight inflation and is the program of most central banks. It hardly gets more ideological and political. This nonsensical neoliberal propaganda is everywhere and it is part of the mainstream economics which understands/sells this as scientific facts. Today, economics is only a tool to legitimize neoliberalism. Everyone I listed above is not policy makers but famous economists of mainstream economics. Their models and ideas are considered by most economists as some kind of holy writ and the pinnacle of economic sciences, although they are largely pseudoscientific. Well, but string theory is not used by most physicists to argue that the following fact is good and right for ""scientific"" reasons:  
>  
>[Distribution of wealth - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth)

Pretty much every economist advocates for a delicate balance between inflation and unemployment, which aligns with the goal of every competent central bank. It is asinine to suggest that they are somehow obsessed with lowering inflation as much as possible.

I do not think there is a single economist who treats those four figures and their work as some sort of holy bible...

As for their claim about wealth inequality, the [majority of economists](https://www.kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/inequality/) do think that it is a problem. And many of the panelists who voted disagree/uncertain did so because they perceived the factors *causing* inequality to be the problem, not inequality itself. Of course, there are disagreements over what are the exact causes, or over which cause is the most important, but the gravity of the issue is not at dispute.

>A very clear example that economics is at best just astrology for clueless politicians, and at its worst just an excuse to make tbe rich richer, was visible after the credit crisis in the Netherlands in 2008. Clueless PM Mark Rutte sought economical advice and from the economical community two opposite advices were given. A. This is the time for the goverment to support the people and (small) companies. B. Austerity. Fuck the people. Clueless Mark, being tbe rightwing little shithead he is chose B and dunked the Netherlands in an unnecessary long recession, actually one of the longest in the western world. The fact that an economical community can pretend to be a science and then, when needed, can be 50/50 split on what the best course of action is, while everybody has access to all macroeconomic information, shows that it is bogus and not science.

Countercyclical fiscal policy is seen as a reasonable course of action by most economists, especially when monetary policy has been exhausted. It is not a 50-50 split at all. Now, it is true that there is dispute over when exactly to execute such policy, and over whether or not the increase in debt outweighs the short-term economic stimulus, but the user fails to present this nuance at all.

Economic consensus has been reached on many other issues as well, as explained in the FAQ.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq\_methods/#wiki\_can\_economists\_reach\_consensus\_on\_any\_issue.3F](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_methods/#wiki_can_economists_reach_consensus_on_any_issue.3F)

>Econ teaches you how the status quo is correct and natural. It is the opposite of science and thus far easier to do and make money in.

The idea that economics merely defends the status quo is ridiculous. The [recent research](https://arindube.com/minimum-wage-research/) [into the impact of](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/137/1/267/6355463) higher minimum wages is just one single example of how economic thinking has shifted over time.

As for the claim that economists make more money than physicists, salary data from the BLS shows that physicists actually make more money than economists do.

Welcome to my first RI. I am but a lowly not-even-undergrad and have no formal economic education (this will change soon), so criticism is very welcome and I'm sure it will be needed. You can look forward to a not very sophisticated argument on my part.


>You could make a good argument that our problem is an oversupply of workers.


You could also make the argument that wumbo has no alts (am I doing this right so far?).

>Our immigration rate has almost halved since 2009, but we are still maintaining very high immigration at 1.4%. The government probably can't do much to raise this (and shouldn't - though it wants to for reasons I'll explain). It *should* be looking at lowering it. 

These “reasons” are to increase house prices, apparently. I don't even know how to RI that.


>Here's why.


Oh shit waddup, I'm ready.

>Young people in this country are struggling to find work. That's worrying because we are in a rapidly aging population.


Youth unemployment in Australia in June 2016 was 13.2%, a little below the average of 13.5% since 1978. This isn't too terrible, especially since Australia is in the middle of a transition from a heavily resource based economy (which was a significant source of much of our economic gains throughout the 2000s until early this decade). There has been a mild trend upwards since 2009, about 1% higher now than it was then.

>In a languishing job market, where wages aren't growing


For the record, Australia's Wage Price Index grew 2.1% year-on-year to the June quarter, whereas inflation was 1% for the same period. There have been some quarters over the past two years or so where real wage growth has been limited, but these are fairly isolated, and don't represent the overall trend (from a few years to a few decades long).


>too many skilled immigrants (and barely skilled immigrants) are filling the jobs that would otherwise be filled with young people - who then need to subsist on welfare. There is little economic gain in this beyond further inflating the housing bubble.


To the claim that immigrants (skilled and unskilled) fill jobs that would otherwise be filled by young people: immigrants and natives do not directly compete for the same work. In other words, they are imperfect substitutes, as they have different skills, not least in language, and seek different jobs - generally immigrants seek jobs that natives don't want to do or where there is a skills shortage. It is generally more advantageous to hire a native due to their cultural and language skills, amongst other reasons (racism). (On a more basic level, I what makes him think that immigrants in their “30s and 40s” have an equal skillset to those in the early 20s?) This is evidenced by [Ottiovani and Peri](https://www.google.com.ar/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w14188&ved=0ahUKEwiM8uChhu_OAhVCiJAKHdmmCvsQFggZMAA&usg=AFQjCNEDsjdj_EuMDT4Sg_LsNN-TQnkXhg) who show in the long run, even low skilled immigrants have a positive effect on low skilled natives’ incomes. In the short run, there is some wage depression for natives which can be rectified with redistribution, a sentiment reflected in the low skilled immigration [IGM Poll](http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_5vuNnqkBeAMAfHv). (their high skilled immigration poll shows overwhelming support for it). Peri studies the [effects of immigration on productivity](http://www.nber.org/papers/w15507.pdf), which are vast and lead to an overall improvement for employment. [Boubtane, Coulibaly and Roult](http://ftp.iza.org/dp5853.pdf) find that, “using annual data over the period 1980-2005 for 22 OECD countries… in any country, immigration does not cause unemployment.”

>Now, that fucker is *going* to burst someday. You could make a solid argument it's already peaking (which usually lasts 12-18 months).


I really don't know much about the housing market so I can't comment on this but...


>A bubble is great for profiting the people who economically lucked out because they happened to be property owners when it began (in this case, the Boomers)


… the soak the boomers rhetoric makes me think that OP doesn't either. I seriously doubt his opinions are based on evidence. It's simple rhetoric. The whole post screams this.

>Alas... Our government loves immigration because it is a bandaid; it keeps the housing bubble from bursting *just that little bit longer*.


See above, immigration is loved because it has [generally positive effects on the economy](http://www.nber.org/papers/w12497.pdf), and is an effective medium term growth strategy. This is especially true for skilled migrants and natives (which is what the post is concerned with, rather than low skilled immigration).


>We also need to encourage births (which again needs to follow young people getting established, employed and financially secure) because immigration *cannot* replace births as a population sustainment measure - it just fucking can't.


TIL brown people are infertile.


>As our economy contracts, adding more and more and more immediate arrivals to occupy a finite number of jobs is not a solution


The economy is growing. Not sure how you can just state something so blatantly wrong? And jobs are not finite. How come unemployment has not massively risen with population growth (largely due to immigration)? Does this mean there have been… more jobs? Shiiiit.


>it's idiotic, myopic and it will come back to bite us in the ass.


As evidenced already, this is wrong especially in the long run. Immigration comes back to kiss us on (possibly in) the ass.

OP does suggest a targeted immigration scheme, which as far as I know isn't bad economics. But we already have them, in the form of the General Skilled Migration and 457 Visa programs. There are probably tweaks that could be made to improve skills targeting.


Other comments from the thread:


>The problem is just that there isn't enough work any more. More and more automation coupled with a growing population means less and less jobs. Immigration adds to the problem, but it isn't the cause, and halting immigration will slow the problem, but won't solve it.


Won't bother citing papers here because the overwhelming and very well-researched consensus is that technological change is the only consistent source of productivity growth, which in turn is the only consistent source of long term wages and living standards growth. Automation will displace some jobs in the short run, but will ultimately be a Kaldor-Hicks improvement, giving way for the government to make it a Pareto improvement through redistribution. Often disruptions of this kind have avoidable negative impacts because governments are too incompetent; they will need to improve skills in the economy, an area where government consistently underperforms, and aim redistribution at those hurt. I use the same argument for free trade. In addition, automation complements labour and raises demand for it through increased output due to productivity improvements. I think history is evidence enough for my point.


>I can't see an easy solution to this. A business owner has two options if they want to compete and make a profit; pay fewer employees to work more hours, or underpay more employees.

Labour is not the sole cost to business.


>The private job agencies will fix this problem. Any day now.

Proceeds to disagree with the definition of rent seeking.,"A thread is posted to SubredditDrama with drama involving landlords. Naturally, this leads to an argument in SRD about landlords. The badecon begins [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/bzeq5k/op_thinks_that_his_landlord_is_extorting_him_and/eqs6y8n/), where a user asserts that renting out properties is rent seeking. This is a pretty understandable misinterpretation of the term 'economic rent.' However, this leads a user to point out that this is a misunderstanding of the term. Said user is downvoted, and where it gets interesting, as another user responds with a [definition of rent seeking](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/bzeq5k/op_thinks_that_his_landlord_is_extorting_him_and/eqs9ce4/) that very explicitly says that renting properties is not in and of itself rent seeking. From here, the argument evolves into [whether or not landlords create value and/or perform labour](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/bzeq5k/op_thinks_that_his_landlord_is_extorting_him_and/eqsdluq/), with some users pointing out that landlords do indeed create value/perform labour. There are several long argument chains here, but they all can be basically summed up by the above, so we'll focus on that.

RI: So what is rent seeking, and why is this bad economics? Rent seeking is a process in which one aims to increase their share of wealth while creating no new wealth. Common examples of this behaviour include regulatory capture, where regulations and policy are changed to artificially increase profits, and monopolistic markets. This leads us to question whether or not landlords create wealth. It can be tempting to assume that the answer is no, as it is not immediately obvious that landlords are creating wealth by maintaining properties. However this ignores two simple facts. The first is that depreciation exists. A car with 90 000km on it is less valuable than a car with 25 000km on it due to wear and tear, necessary repairs, etc., which we can generally refer to as depreciation. Landlords maintain properties and act against depreciation, thereby preventing the reduction of wealth, which is functionally the same as creating new wealth.

The second is that the land landlords lord over is more valuable by having properties rented on it and maintained. This is [pointed out](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/bzeq5k/op_thinks_that_his_landlord_is_extorting_him_and/eqslp88/), however it falls on deaf ears. Ensuring tenants and their apartments are maintained, processing new tenants, ensuring safety and security, etc., all make a property more valuable than if the property was not maintained. A pretty simple way of thinking about this is asking yourself whether or not a property would be more valuable maintained and managed than if it were not. Try not to strain yourself doing that.

This is not to say that it is impossible for a landlord to engage in rent-seeking behaviour. Regulatory capture, as I stated before, is rent-seeking behaviour, and if a landlord for example were to have zoning laws changed so that their apartment complex was the only one allowed, that would be rent-seeking behaviour. However, despite the fact that the two words are spelled the same way, economic 'rent' and property 'rent' are not the same thing.",StarkDay,t2_vdpras,0.97,257,140

[So there are two claims being made here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/61qwss/the_fiat_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/dfhehe3/):

1. A $15/hr minimum wage nationally in the U.S. would be too high (as shown by evidence).

2. MW should not exceed half of median wages (as shown by evidence).

The bad economics is current literature on the subject doesn't show either of these points. AFAIK there are no empirical studies on a MW (in the U.S.) comparable to $15/hr, because it's never been done. [Current research on MW is contentious](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_minwage), though slowly moving toward acceptance as having negligible effects (previously being viewed as an ineffective price floor).

I've generally recieved less than favorable responses when I've asked for citations, /u/laboreconomist3 was nice enough to provide several. Of those I could review (I don't have a copy of ""The Natural Survival of Work"") *none* addressed excessive minimum wages, $15/hr., or the guideline of 1/2 median wages. This last proposal comes from an article for a think tank, which was [another response in the same thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/61qwss/the_fiat_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/dfha4hr/) I have a [link to the paper here.](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/state_local_minimum_wage_policy_dube.pdf)

In order, a review of the first poster's citations:

* [Why Does the Minimum Wage Have 
No Discernible Effect on Employment
?](http://cepr.net/documents/publications/min-wage-2013-02.pdf)

This article from the CEPR think tank provides a nice overview of current literature on minimum wage. Interesting tidbits from academia is they largely focus on one industry (food service) and mostly one demographic, teenagers. Already this raises issues for drawing broader conclusions as effects within an industry or demographic may be correlated for other reasons. It could be raising the minimum wage to $15/hr would signal a large decline in the restaurant industry while promoting other sectors as is seen with winners and losers in free trade or automation.

But I digress. The overview of academic work and meta analysis finds negligible, near zero effects on employment. There is some contention from one meta-analysis, Neumark and Wascher's but has questionable rigor and bias:

>""The  Neumark  and  Wascher  review,  however,  is  considerably  more  subjective  and  arguably  less relevant to the United States than the two meta-studies discussed earlier. Only 52 of the 102 studies reviewed by Neumark and Wascher analyzed U.S. data. Of these, Neumark and Wascher designated 19  as  ""most  credible,""  **five  of  which  were  their  own  studies.**19The  Neumark  and  Wascher  (2006) review  also  excludes  several  important  papers  that  were  not  published  until  after  the  review  was completed,  including  the  important  contributions  of  Arindrajit  Dube,  William  Lester,  and  Michael Reich (2010) and Sylvia Al
legretto, Dube, and Reich (2011) (to which we will return to below).""

Emphasis added (page 6, PDF page 8 of 30). None of the separate papers reviewed addressed excessive minimum wage increases, but instead focus on different aspects of employment effects given past increases, which typically are on the order of ~10% of past MW. The remainder of the article focuses on mechanisms in response to wage increases, so called ""adjustment channels"".

* [The Effects of a Minimum-Wage Increase on Employment and 
Family Income](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44995-MinimumWage.pdf)

This is a study put together by the CBO to look at the potential effects of increasing minimum wages to $9/hr. and $10.10/hr. It seeks to model outcomes in employment and income for such changes, and is *not* directed as assessing a $15/hr. MW or creating guidelines for an optimal MW. The projection itself is very tenuous, with the projected effects of the higher MW being, ""...in CBO’s assessment, there is 
about a **two-thirds chance** that the effect would be in the 
range between a very slight reduction in employment and 
a reduction in employment of 1.0 million workers..."" Emphasis added. Although a generous reading can conclude from this source a higher MW increase leads to more disemployment effects it is not strongly supported. The CBO made their calculations (page 21, PDF page 25 or 43) using past research on teen elasticties which is subject to [skewed conclusions.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Funnel_Graph_of_Estimated_Minimum_Wage_Effects.jpg) 

The CBO also concedes having adjust data of short term effects to make long term projections. See Page 23, pdf page 27 of 43 for a list of issues between past research and their desired projection.


* [Minimum Wage](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/minimum-wage)

This last link is just a survey of economists asking their *opinions* on two aspects of MW laws for a change to $9hr. Like anything else having to do with MW its inconclusive, at least for effects. Oddly enough majority opinion supports increases despite effects, which means even those who thought it was harmful to some degree still supported the increase.

* [Proposal 13: Designing Thoughtful Minimum Wage Policy at the State and Local Levels](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/state_local_minimum_wage_policy_dube.pdf)

This is what often gets tossed around as the rule of thumb for prudent MW increases. What's of interest is that it's not a peer-reviewed work, and it simply takes a historical baseline as target. It's a very status quo argument, and while it may make sense as a conservative approach to ensure an increase known to be safe it does pose challenges from evolving standards of social equity. To further clarify my last point imagine if the gender pay gap of the past were addressed by such an approach. We would not see rapid increases in pay for women because that was beyond current experience, and so then would instead find the average disparate pay to men's median wage and seek to maintain that ratio. Dube does recognize this issue.

I suspect it also has a natural appeal as the poverty threshold for OECD statistical purposes is defined as [1/2 median household income.](https://data.oecd.org/inequality/poverty-rate.htm) Appealing as it may be for convenience this still fails to ground MW increases by empirical data.

In fact this paper in its conclusions states his proposal more cautiously, and even provides a citation for negligible effects well above his own guideline:

>""The proposed increase of the minimum wage to half the full-
time  median  wage  does  go  somewhat  above  the  range  from  
which we can draw the best empirical evidence. This obstacle is 
difficult to avoid given the rather low levels of minimum wages 
since 1980. A number of additional factors make it reasonable 
to apply the existing estimates when evaluating this proposal, 
however.  First,  an  increase  in  the  minimum  wage  from  41  
percent  to  50  percent  of  the  median  full-time  wage,  while  
substantial, is still cautious. It maintains the ratio within both 
historical  and  international  bounds.  Second,  existing  U.S.  
evidence  that  suggests  small  employment  effects  is  based  on  
a number of states (e.g., Nevada, Oregon, Vermont) that have 
all  raised  their  state  minimum  wages  to  levels  that  surpass  
46  percent  of  their  median  full-time  wage.  **Finally,  evidence  
from the United Kingdom suggests that raising the minimum 
wage close to the median full-time wage is not associated with 
sizable effects on employment (Manning 2012).**""

Emphasis added (page 9, PDF page 9 of 13).

In rebuttal I offer [this editorial by Krueger](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/opinion/sunday/the-minimum-wage-how-much-is-too-much.html?_r=0) of Card and Krueger fame, who is cautious as a matter of opinion, but is clear current research is inadequate to address such a question (it's worth noting Krueger has published no more research on MW since the mid 90s as noted in the CEPR article). Specifically he notes:

>""...but a $15-an-hour national minimum wage would put us in uncharted waters, and risk undesirable and unintended consequences.""

and

>""But $15 an hour is beyond international experience, and could well be counterproductive.""

The correct statement, and here Krueger is quite right, is that we don't know what would happen given a substantial increase in the minimum wage. There just isn't enough evidence, probably because such increases tend to err on the side of caution i.e. small increases. I respect his opinion, but as a matter of empirically derived evidence the question is unresolved.

Finally in support of my argued conclusion that a $15/hr minimum wage is uncharted territory we have the parting line from BE's own FAQ on the matter:

>""For larger increases in the minimum wage such as a 15MW, there is not good data to describe the potential impacts and larger employment effects are possible.""

For me this issue comes across as a thought experiment gone wrong; a return to laffer curve thinking. ""Well a priori there should be diminishing returns for ~~tax~~ MW increases, and at some point those should be so great as to make such an increase cause more harm than good."" And like the laffer curve we face the same measurement problem, where a ""reasonable"" person's opinion of what is ideal gets substituted for hard data.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
As an aside I can't help but think the community perception of this ""rule"" as being well grounded parallels with groupthink. Borrowing from another field experiencing a similar systemic problem I use the example in Lee Smolin's ""The Trouble with Physics"" were he recounts confusion over whether string theory has been proved finite (at the time of his writing it had not). In his account even non-string theorists accepted such a view though no paper had ever made such a claim. Like a bad game of telephone a weaker formulation was repeated until the stronger statement became conventional wisdom.

&#x200B;

Quickly the erudite discourse which reddit is known for was in full sway, and some of the comments piqued my interest.  

&#x200B;

""Often because of poor education or lack of proper contraceptives.""

""And being poor you get more help from the government per kid. If your  worker class then having more kids is a death sentence. For upper middle  class it’s a dynasty. Then rich people usually try to have 3-4 kids and  keep it at that. The only people I see having 5+ kids are dirt poor  people or high middle class""

""Or welfare systems that pay out more depending on the number of kids you have.""

""Poor people don't plan well, part of why they are poor.""

""Can't afford contraception but can afford kids 🤔""

&#x200B;

These, sometimes contradicting, points are as hollow as the heads of the people uttering them, but I have heard similar remarks so frequently that I wanted to take the time to explain why this line of reasoning is an example of Bad Economics.

&#x200B;

I think it would be useful to summarize these points into 2  main arguments that these comments are making, and that I will be addressing.

&#x200B;

1. Welfare encourages more children, i.e. have more children is a result of a coldly calculated cost-benefit analysis, where the person in question is only interested in the extremely lucrative welfare check
2. People in poverty having more children is a result of some lack of intelligence and/or morals, and this lack of intelligence and/or morals is probably related to why they are in poverty in the first place

Not only are these points largely contradictory, they are also both wrong. 

&#x200B;

For the first argument, the 1990's saw huge changes to the welfare system in the USA. Out of concern that this very sentiment, that welfare encouraged some families to have more children, some states instituted some form of a ""family cap"" where after having X children a family would receive fewer, or no more benefits per a child.

As [this Brooking's article](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/is-there-an-effect-of-incremental-welfare-benefits-on-fertility-behavior-a-look-at-the-family-cap/) states, the family cap policies were not the result of any changing birth rates. This allowed the authors to treat the family cap policies as exogenous, and so they could use the states instituting this rule as a quasi-experiment. They find no impact, suggesting that welfare does not play a role in family planning. [Other reports](https://www.cbpp.org/research/family-income-support/temporary-assistance-for-needy-families) are similar.

&#x200B;

As for the addressing the second argument I want to quote some small sections of [Theodore Schultz's Nobel Prize lecture](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1979/schultz/lecture/), and I encourage people to read the whole thing. 

""Historical perception is also lacking with   respect to population. We  extrapolate global statistics and are   horrified by our interpretation  of them, mainly that poor people   breed like lemmings headed toward  their own destruction. Yet that   is not what happened looking back at  our own social and economic   history when people were poor. It is  equally false with respect   to population growth in today’s poor  countries.""

...

We   have learned that poor people are no less concerned about    improving their lot and that of their children than those of us who have incomparably greater advantages. Nor are they any less   competent  in obtaining the maximum benefit from their limited   resources. The  central thrust of this lecture is that population quality and  knowledge matter.""

Here ""quality"" is tantamount  to human capital. In short Shultz is addressing the same issue here, saying that it is not because of some lack of intelligence, or a moral failing that people in poverty have more children. Although it is true that [developing countries have higher fertility rates than developed countries](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/december/link-fertility-income), the meaning ascribed to this fact usually lacks ""historical perception"", as Shultz called it, and often involves throwing out the basic assumptions we would otherwise employ if we were talking about more well-off people.

&#x200B;

[The St. Louis Fed](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/december/link-fertility-income) offers; higher costs for raising a child in developed countries, differing rates of infant mortality, children taking care of their parents when they are older in developing countries as being potential reasons for the difference in fertility. 

An analysis in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/04/upshot/up-birth-age-gap.html) says ""Women with college degrees have children an average of seven years later than those without"" one possible reason being that women with a degree have a higher opportunity cost for starting a family as early as women without a degree. 

&#x200B;

In short, although there are of course factors that given the right data we can analyze empirically that impact birth rates, the idea that welfare would play an overwhelming role is debunked. Furthermore this idea, and the argument that the higher rates of fertility in developing countries, or amongst people in poverty in general, is evidence of some lack on their part is nothing more than the same lazy reasoning that Shultz had hoped we would leave behind decades ago.",Traansposition,t2_jm05txpp,0.91,183,45

It's actually a case of [badeconomiception based off this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/qsoen0/tiktoker_reinvents_the_principalagent_problem/). Your humble narrator responded to a comment stating:

>Anyone making more money will be more motivated to work at full potential.

I voiced mild disapproval for these reasons: beyond a certain level of low income, peoples productivity is untethered to salary/hourly compensation. I can get the argument that minimum wage employees don't get paid enough to care, and that being paid below a certain level means you can't afford things like stable transportation and child care which makes you a less productive employee. Let's just pick an arbitrary salary level for the sake of illustration. 

A worker making $30k per year can afford a stable life, and is working in job 1. Their benevolent employer raises their pay to $45k to continue to work in job 1. The worker thinks to himself ""wow, now that I'm making 50% more, I'm going to work 50% harder.""

Said no one, ever.

This cargo cult mentality belies the fact that there is a relation between compensation and productivity. According to supply and demand from econ 101, a job posting offering more money will receive more applicants than a job posting with less, ceteris paribus of course. The employer will be able to select better candidates that are naturally more productive because more people are applying -> the statistical probability of a hireable candidate goes up with an increasing pool of applicants (ceteris paribus). 

A good example was that I was in the job market a few months ago, I got 5 job offers, and I took the one that offered me the most money. I am of course completely reliable so when I tell you that the hiring company is benefiting from having hired me you should believe me. Those other companies didn't fork up the dosh so they're left with significantly inferior employees.

And that's when the argument started. 

I received a comment that:

>Even if you were to pose a commission based wage (which attempts to utilize this) you can't actually gauge the proposal that a person is naturally more productive out of a series by which you exclude others, or said another way, you never get to actually find out who is the most productive for the role because you only hire one out of the 100. You can't validate your choice is the best choice.

At face value there's truth there. No one is going to claim that every person was the best suited candidate for their role, but even at the level of an individual company and certainly across the entire labor market of a country the size of the US, if you hire the 3rd most productive rather than the 1st most productive candidate out of 250 candidates it doesn't matter at a material level. We're quickly approaching the edge of sanity here though. 

>Even if you were to pose a commission based wage

User claims that salespeople that are compensated up to 100% based on how much revenue they bring into a company are not being compensated on how much value they derive for the company. This kind of feels like when ""Fight for $15"" people go on Fox News and the retort is ""well why not just make minimum wage $250?""

>For instance very few people in most places would apply to be a CEO because they understand that they actually have no business running a company no matter the size meanwhile almost no one feels intimidated about working in a warehouse presuming basic physical ability therefore you aren't scooping the cream of the crop up with high wages at all.

User claims that you need to force people to be CEOs but people are lining up for warehouse jobs. Current headlines from newspapers seem to indicate that there is a [truck driver shortage](https://qz.com/2086977/there-is-no-truck-driver-shortage-in-the-us/) but I personally have never heard of a CEO shortage.

At this point I thought user just misunderstood what I said, it was a flippiant comment that I wrote while using the facilities so perhaps it would be easier to frame the same argument in an example. A company needs to hire developers to build features so they go into the labor market to hire. Some developers aren't productive enough, so they wouldn't get hired at all, some developers are great but outside the price we're willing to pay, and some are just right. Raising the wage offered would attract that great dev. It's goldilocks and the three inverted binary trees, I'm sure you the audience get what I'm referring to. 

In this I also point out that he's making the assumption that hiring is random. Whether you have 100 applicants or 1000 applicants if you choose one at random you're going to have the same statistical outcome. I explain that in general people hire candidates that they feel are a good fit, so if you're only hiring the top 10% of candidates, whether they only attract 10 or 100 starts to matter.

Referring to the warehouse, I point out that a warehouse would find more applicants and be able to choose better applicants if they increased hourly from $14/hr to $21/hr. 

In reference to referring to some dev candidates being more productive than others:

>How do you know this? I mean that word by the way, ""know"".

I receive a fairly long explanation on how it is impossible to assess any candidate on any ability to do any job. People lie you know? Secondly, how would a company evaluate how productive they are over a given period of time? It's not like you can just put a dollar value on it. 

>In fact in the warehouse example the 14 vs 21 might intimidate weaker people [...] This is a real problem by the way.

We now have scientific proof that offering more money in job ads results in less candidates applying.

Now I've hired a fair number of people over the years, and one of the things I do if the ad isn't getting enough applicants is raise the wage offered. It works 100% of the time to the point where I've never even considered that people could see a posting that was underperforming and not even consider raising pay. 

So at this point it's like... why? But I still persevere. You can assess the value of a feature that a developer builds by testing the market, focus groups, whatever. Almost every product that exists today underwent some evaluation on profitability before the company committed millions of dollars on building it. It's 2021, Jeff Bezos is out here calculating how many shits his drivers are taking and how that impacts how many rockets he can build.

>But in the case of your coders you might actually find that people who produce, according to your valuation, $200 code might say, ""I am not worth 120k, I am only worth $100k"" and simply opt out upfront never applying to begin with.

Guys, the biggest issue facing the labor market right now is that workers are undervaluing their labor to the detriment of the companies that employ them.

His argument for companies apparently using a random number generator as the hiring process:

>Most hiring is done through HR [...] doesn't actually guarantee the filter works well.

Look homies, go through my post history. I hate how dumb HR is with a passion, but there can be good HRs out there, somewhere, and it's a far cry from ""HR intentionally picks bad candidates for the hiring manager to interview"".

In reference to a company determining if a feature is worth building:

Brookings argues that Universal Basic Income won't solve poverty and would suck up the federal budget. Of course, UBI (in some form) is supported by a variety of figures from both the left in the right, so OP could have made a logical, well-reasoned post about how giving money away is the key to solving poverty. Instead, he accuses his opponents of being wealthy sociopaths and neoliberal shills.

>Right out the gate we start with a logical fallacy. We are not limited to these two options. These two options are being presented to us as the only two options because it is the only two options wealthy sociopaths are willing to consider. Removing subsidies for corporations, scaling back military funding, raising taxes on the wealthy, these are not mentioned, because the wealthy are not interested in even acknowledging the possibility.

[The main problem is that a UBI of only $12k/year is prohibitively expensive and would suck up 70% of the US budget.](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-06-06/universal-basic-income-is-ahead-of-its-time-to-say-the-least) Of course there are some savings, since we could eliminate social security, and move medicare to premium support, since after all the UBI was supposed to *replace* all other forms of social welfare. And keep in mind, this is for a UBI of only $12k/year which is less than what social security currently pays to the average retiree. A more ""reasonable"" UBI of $20k/year would consume 116% of the national budget.

Of course I haven't addressed his point yet about cutting back other expenditures. Let's look at hypothetically implementing UBI in the country of Denmark, which is near the revenue maximizing point of the Laffer Curve. According to Bernie Sanders it's socialist utopia with all the high taxes, high spending, and low corporate welfare an American liberal could want. (Denmark actually very neoliberal but that's beside the point) [Denmark taxes 48% of GDP per year, compared to 25% in the US.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending#As_a_percentage_of_GDP) [A UBI equivalent of $20k/year per person in Denmark would consume 90% of all tax revenues.](https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm). Remember, that implementing such a UBI would involve cancelling all public pensions, social security, government health care programs, with just 10% of tax revenues left to spend on the military, schools, roads, courts, prisons and other vital government functions.

>Victim blaming, and taking a ""we know best"" approach is terrifying. They are openly insisting that they know what people need better then the people who are asking for what they need. Piling on the mentally ill, and drug addicted is adorable, given that they've done literally nothing to resolve these issues in the first place. Using it as an example for why a policy which might actually help them would actually fail them is out of touch, at best, and maliciously psychotic, which is more likely.

Now we arrive at the big question: are economists maliciously psychotic shills or just out of touch? No just kidding: [would giving unconditional cash payments to drug addicts, the mentally ill, and the homeless generate long term benefits for their welfare?](http://www.drugandalcoholdependence.com/article/S0376-8716\(09\)00050-7/abstract?cc=y=) And conversely, [would offering conditional cash payments (on work, treatment etc.) promote greater welfare gains?](http://www.bmj.com/content/315/7110/703.short) 

The first study was a RCT between cocaine users and sober individuals. The first part of the experiment demonstrated that when given unconditional cash payments (the participation payment) the cocaine users performed much worse. The second part of the experiment demonstrated that when given cash incentives to perform well, the cocaine users performed equally to the sober individuals. In the second study I cite, patients who were paid to comply with medical treatment were more likely to comply in 90% of the literature reviewed. Therefore, giving unconditional cash payments to the drug-addicted is probably worse than giving payments conditional on treatment.

>P.S. I upvoted this article because people need to see how insane the wealthy have become. They are not capable of responding rationally. This is the face of your society. Irrational nutjobs with more wealth then sense.

[The wages of Brookings Senior Fellows are about $100k/year](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Brookings-Institution-Salaries-E21334.htm). That hardly qualifies as uber-wealthy. Also the irony is definitely lost on OP after he accuses his opponents of being irrational, sociopathic shills when presented with a reasoned argument against his beliefs.

BONUS UPDATE:
>I read the top response and all the others they were a big bunch of BS. And none of them addressed the essential problem that economics is going to have to solve and our current system will crash and burn if we don't solve it. That would be that according to the latest oxford study in the US alone 47% of jobs are going to be automated away over the next twenty years. That's an underestimate, because that doesn't consider knock on effects like the jobs that depend on the jobs that were automated. It also doesn't include the effect of globalization either. So I would say unemployment is going to be much higher than 47% maybe even a little higher than 50% by the end of the next 20 years. The great depression happened when we had around 30% unemployment. If you would like to argue that new jobs will replace these jobs then I challenge you to tell me where these jobs will come from and how the average joe will get them. I'd also like you to keep in mind that over 90% of the jobs available today are the same jobs available 100 years ago.

Highlights:

1. Predicts greater than 50% unemployment due to automation
2. Declares jobs lost to automation won't be balanced out by new jobs created through efficiency gains. Worse, suggests automation will actually destroy existing jobs further down the supply chain.
3. Asserts that 90% of current jobs existed in an essentially unchanged form 100 years ago.

> If jobs are disappearing or moving overseas because of automation, why do we need more immigration? If the number of jobs is going to be much lower, we will obviously need less people to fill them

Here, the user commits the lump of labor fallacy, which is the idea that the number of jobs is static.  This is not true - if immigrants can preform labor for less money, that frees up money for consumers to spend elsewhere, creating new demand and new jobs to meet that demand.  Furthremore, immigrants can also start businesses and employ people.  Thee is empirical evidence that suggests that [immigration doesn't impact local wages very much](http://www.nber.org/papers/w14683).  Furthermore, economists [mostly believe that even low skilled immigration doesn't have too big of a negative impact on wages](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/low-skilled-immigrants).  And, unemployment is currently at about 4.6%, which is essentially full employment.

> If the jobs are going to be more skilled, then why are we OK with accepting immigrants and refugees with no skills and who can't speak the language?

Our current immigration system gives priority to higher skilled workers via things like H1B permits.  High skilled immigrants contribute to our [economy](http://edq.sagepub.com/content/16/1/20.short) (link courtesy of /u/saw_wot_again)Furthermore, if they have ""no skills"" and can't speak the language, then why would they be getting employed over citizens?  The only explanations that make sense are either that there are jobs open, or that native citizens won't do the jobs that are open.

> If the reason we need immigration is not just to fill jobs that ""Americans wont do"" is to pay into Social Security, then obviously there is a huge problem with Social Security. If it requires infinite growth, there will be a huge problem somewhere down the line. It would be much better to address that problem than to keep throwing bodies at it.

This is a rather unrelated claim, but I want to touch on it a bit - while it's true that social security is definitely going to need cuts to actually get it to work, in the medium (edit , again, thanks to swa) term we need all the help we can get to prevent it from going insolvent.

False.  If a company can produce things more cheaply, unless it is a monopoly, it will reduce prices to compete with other companies.

We rarely get bad econometrics!

RI:

In general, one can not assume that two different groups are identical when evaluating the effects of different policies.  All countries have different policies (other than the one being examined), cultures, industry concentrations, business cycles etc. that make it pretty hard to determine the effects of the policy in question, for all of the standard reasons (selection bias, reverse causality, omitted variable bias).

Looking at a time series is not going to be a good approach for determining MW effects, because they are generally overwhelmed by  business cycle effects. Dube has a nice post on this: http://arindube.com/2014/01/22/casual-versus-causal-inference-time-series-edition/

It was hard to choose which thread to R1, but I decided on this one because it makes somewhat-clear economic arguments, whereas most threads of this type merely use the language of economics to describe noneconomic phenomena. 

The author starts out by modeling sex as a commodity, in which men are buyers and women are sellers:

> Women treat sex like a tradable commodity. Like every other commodity, sex is subject to the sacred underpinnings of economic law: Supply and Demand.

Now right off the bat the author makes the huge assumption that women are not also consumers of sex (i.e. they “demand” it). This is more of a sociological/psychological assertion, so I won’t look any deeper into this. While assumptions are a part of any model, the problem here is that the author does not acknowledge that this assertion is an assumption which underpins his entire model. The author also does not specify what women get in return for sex. I’ll assume he means that men do stuff in exchange for women. Since this stuff takes time and effort, it has an opportunity cost which we can express in terms of currency. So in exchange for supplying sex, we’ll say that the man does stuff for the woman.







Next, the author makes an assertion about the structure of the market for sex:

> It's a classic cartel situation, like OPEC. Women pretty much control the supply of sex: they ration it out and create an artificial shortage. Yet, demand is hot. That is why they can get us pay to through the nose for it.

 No, actually, it’s not a classic cartel situation. A cartel normally occurs in an oligopoplistic market and involves collusion among suppliers to set the price of a commodity at a level which maximizes profit. The author also does not explain what makes the supply of sex artificially low, rather than just being the actual amount of sex women are willing to supply. If I had to guess, I’d say that the author defines “artificially low” as “less sex than I want.” Now to be fair, the author later makes some Adam Smith-esque statements, explaining that women are not actually colluding, but behave as if they were, saying

> Women don't always consciously realize that this is what they're doing. There's no big conspiracy, this is just how women naturally seem to behave … As a result, the aggregate efforts of all these individual women acting in their own self-interests to optimize conditions for themselves have dovetailed together into what merely seems like a conscious implementation of a massive cartel.

Okay, so the argument is that women police other women’s behavior in order to keep the “price” of sex higher than its market value. Got it. To nitpick, “massive cartel” is a bit of an oxymoron, but whatever. The author then explains that this high price creates a sex shortage, saying

> There's a shortage of sex, therefore, the price is high.

Now I’m confused. Which caused which according to the author? Did the high price cause the shortage, or did the shortage cause high prices? See, this is the problem with a lot of Redpill economics threads: the arguments just aren’t clear. To my knowledge, there aren’t any Redpill economic models that use math, which is unfortunate, because that would make the arguments a lot clearer and easier to critique. As it is, there’s nothing more I can really say because the actual economics of the author’s argument is so sparse.

The rest of the post rambles on like this and then goes off on a tangent that I didn’t bother to read. 

I hope to do more R1s of Redpill economics, so I’ll keep on the lookout for some juicy threads. 

P.S. I think I might have found some bad game theory as well, but I don't know enough economics to critique it:

> The cartel is how women managed to bargain some measure of control over just about everything. That's just one of the myriad ways in which women counteract male power (or rather, male power might've originally developed to counteract women's sexual leverage over us? It's a chicken-egg paradox, to be sure.) That's just one way we're cowed into submission. Women think that they have to control sex because men control everything else... well, it makes as much sense to say that men have to control everything else because women control sex.

572,s64hqq,2022-01-17,badeconomics,An anatomy of Bitcoin price manipulation,"As usual, this post is also [on my blog](https://www.singlelunch.com/2022/01/09/an-anatomy-of-bitcoin-price-manipulation/) with footnotes and inlined images.

--------------

It's commonly said that *""cryptocurrency markets are manipulated""*. Today, you'll see one example of how that particular sausage is made.

[The SEC][1] cites price manipulation as a primary concern when rejecting bitcoin ETF applications. Some [crypto hedge funds][2] retort that ""markets can't be manipulated because they're too big"", which we'll show is nonsense.

While cryptocurrencies have grown in popularity and market capitalization, the volatility of the price has not diminished. One recurrent feature of crypto price is the [BART pattern][3], where periods of low volatility are punctuated by spikes of extreme volatility. The name comes from the resemblance to [Bart Simpson's head](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BART_FIGURE.png)

Volatility spikes like the ones in BART patterns are caused by cascading liquidation events. Speculators making [leveraged bets][4] get forcefully wiped out.

Today, we'll dive into one such market manipulation event with loving detail, the **July 26th Bitcoin short squeeze**. The data I've used to research this is the full Binance orderbook (data courtesy of [CoinStrats][5]) at the millisecond level. Here's what the price data for the event [looks like:][6]

*Note: All charts have hi-res versions if you click on their links*

Note the extreme spike in BTC Futures price compared to other markets. Among Bitcoin mass liquidation events in 2021, this [isn't the largest](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LIQUIDATIONS.png)

The largest liquidation events are forced selling (red bars on the bottom chart, AKA long squeeze). This is because many more crypto speculators are taking leveraged long bets (borrowing to buy more BTC) than short positions (betting that the BTC price goes down). People who speculate on Bitcoin are as a group an optimistic bunch.

The reason we're looking at July 26th rather than [April 18th][7], [May 19th][8], or [December 4th][9] is that it's a better example to write an article about.

The July 26th event has both a clear order book manipulation as well as a classic media manipulation campaign, showing how actors that profit from these events operate.

### The Bullshit Amazon Bitcoin story

The BART pattern in this short squeeze is punctuated by two major pieces of news.

Leading into the upward price spike was a false story about Amazon accepting cryptocurrency payments.

The downward part was instantly triggered by Amazon's official denial of the false story.

In between the up and down part, there's a side-story about [Tether receiving target letters from the DOJ][10], which had a very short lived price effect.

# Timeline of Events

Here is the [timeline of relevant events][11].

Before we get into the actual data analysis, let's take a stroll through the dismal state of online media and how it plays with cryptocurrency.

### July 23rd: Amazon job posting

On July 23rd at 4PM, [Business Insider][12] published an article about an [Amazon job posting][13] looking for a ""Digital Currency and Blockchain Product Lead"" in their Seattle office.

This article is better than the abysmal displays of journalism we'll see later. But still takes considerable liberties to maximize its clickthrough rate.

Reading the job post, you'll see it is looking for a manager to *""develop strategy and product roadmap""*. Translation from business-speak: nothing is built and we don't have an idea of what, if anything, to build, so we're hiring someone to look into it. This is what the amazon spokesperson says in the BI article:

*""In an email to Insider, an Amazon spokesperson confirmed the job posting and the company's ambition to eventually accept cryptocurrency from its customers.""*

Over the next few hours Business Insider AB tests the headline away from reality and into fiction. We can trace this thanks to the [web archive][14] ([picture](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2021-12-26-at-8.10.26-PM.png))

A handful of publications report on this over the 24hr, with no measurable reaction in the cryptocurrency markets.

# July 25th 9AM: The CityAM article

The next important event is Darren Parkin's [CityAM article][15] titled **""Amazon ‘definitely’ lining up Bitcoin payments and token, confirms insider""**, alleging that Amazon will imminently accept Bitcoin payments. All important information in the article comes from an unnamed ""insider"".

36 hours later, [Amazon will deny the article wholesale][16].

By September Amazon [will have removed the job ad][17]. I searched private job ad databases, and that job was never actively advertised or promoted before being taken down. [footnote]This sequence implies one of two things: either the job was already filled internally and the job ad was put up to comply with HR procedures, or Amazon took the position down. Given the position was for a new team's manager, and no subsequent development positions were advertised, it's safe to say Amazon has scrapped the entire cryptocurrency project.[/footnote]

**Note:** I have made requests for comments to both Darren Parkin and the CityAM editorial team. None have been answered.

CityAM has never published a retraction or correction on their article. Rather, they [doubled down][18] on their claims, insulting ""anonymous critics"".

We're not here to take a third rate rag and their inept journalistic practices to the pillory. We're here for the market manipulation. CityAM is but an unknowing cog in a greater machine, happily amplifying the lies from a planted fake source.

### Trading up the chain

Everyone who consumes articles online should read [Trust Me, I'm Lying][19] by Ryan Holiday. The book describes how economic incentives in the online media industry has brought about a second era of [yellow journalism][20][footnote]Recently, subscription based revenue models like Substack, Patreon or the NYT/FT/WSJ subscriptions have started making inroads. Subscription revenue is incentivized towards quality, unlike advertising revenue, which incentivizes clickthrough rate and hence sensationalism[/footnote].

More importantly, Holiday details a common strategy to exploit the broken state of click-driven media, called **""Trading up the chain""**. This scheme starts by planting a lie or half truth at a low quality source (blog, twitter, low-tier news site, etc.). You then ""trade it up the chain"" by having successively more reputable sites report on the report.

Often, by the time you see something bending the truth on your twitter feed or the front page of Reddit, it has gone through 3-4 iterations of this. Each iteration further optimizes for attention by shedding context, exaggerating, foregoing important details, rewording claims, or just outright lying. See Business Insider's headline optimization in our example, for instance.

Media bubbles where fact checking is light, like cryptocurrency reporting, are subject to this. This is also true of politically charged topics, a good example is detailed in this [article on ""Hydroxychloroquine as a COVID treatment""][21] and how it was traded up the chain from a Google Doc to Elon Musk and Donald Trump.

### Preparing the field

Planted false stories being traded up the chain, like the CityAM piece, are part of a pattern. These stories prepare the field for market shenanigans triggering mass liquidation events.

Now, before we dive into the financial aspect of the price manipulation story, we need to cover some background knowledge.

# The Cryptocurrency financial ecosystem

While people think the main innovation of cryptocurrencies are public blockchain ledger transactions, the vast majority of crypto trading happens on private centralized exchanges. Crypto exchanges like Binance, Coinbase or FTX are interesting because they fill multiple functions that are typically segregated in financial markets:

*   A **Custodian** for crypto assets. Getting hacked is a big problem in cryptocurrencies. Blockchain transactions are irreversible, unless your name is [Vitalik Buterin][23]. This makes crypto a great asset to steal or use for [ransom payment][24]. Exchanges solve custody problems because they're less likely to get hacked than you are.

*   A cryptocurrency **Brokerage**. An individual can use the exchange as a broker to place buy and sell orders, which the exchange will go execute for them.

*   A trading **Clearinghouse**. The exchange will match brokerage orders together and act as the final intermediary between a buyer and seller.

It's important to realize that **leverage works differently in crypto markets** than regular commodity or stock markets. In a market like the NASDAQ or CME, the [brokers][25] are separate entities from the [clearing firms][26]. In a crypto exchange, the exchange does both functions at once.

In normal markets, if you get unlucky with a leveraged position, you get [margin called][27]. Your broker gives you some time to give them more collateral or they'll liquidate positions. The broker itself also keeps a margin with the clearinghouse, as a secondary buffer to ensure proper delivery of all orders.

This is normally invisible, except in freak occurrences. One example is Robinhood in a [meme stock frenzy][28], getting margin called by their clearinghouse because of the unprecedented increase in market volatility.

### The fundamental problem of crypto leverage

Offshore crypto exchanges like Binance offer absurd leverage in the 20-125x range. But the exchange is both a broker offering leveraged products and the clearinghouse of the leveraged trades. This can easily create [""failure to deliver""][29] situations from the clearinghouse side. Take this example:

*   We are the only two customers on the exchange. I buy half a BTC and leverage it 10x. You short sell one BTC and leverage it 3x.

*   The market price instantly moves down 33%[footnote]as it tends to do[/footnote], which means you make 1 BTC in profit, and I lose the equivalent of 1.5 BTC

*   I get liquidated from my leveraged position. You should earn a full BTC, but I only have half a BTC to give you!

The exchange has a problem. You're owed more than I can pay you.

The exchange could resolve to pay you the difference from its [insurance fund][30], and lose money. [Carol Alexander suggests][31] that in large liquidation events, like on May 19th, it's possible the exchange misreports numbers to [avoid losing money to their insurance fund][32].

The other option is for the exchange to [auto-deleverage][33] you, saying ""actually you only get half a BTC"". In this case you lose money.

### Interconnected poker tables

The best way to think of crypto markets is that each one is like a poker table. When a trader wins, it comes from someone else's loss at the same table. The prices on all the tables are kept in line by [arbitrage bots][34] who simultaneously buy and sell on each market to keep prices in line.

Delivery is an issue in leveraged liquidations if you are on the winning side. You want to make trades in the place where most assets are. The market implicitly coordinates to a [focal point][35], where having a deeper pool of liquidity means leveraged delivery issues are reduced.

This focal point used to be the [Bitmex XBTCUSD perpetual futures][36], now it's the [Binance BTCUSDT perpetual futures][37].

The great [""innovation""][38] of perpetual futures is that it doesn't require delivering much of anything. Unlike a normal futures contract, where one party has to deliver the commodity when the contract expires, perpetual futures ""delivery"" is only the difference between the spot price and futures price every 8 hours.

This ""delivery-less"" format allows gamblers to take on massive leverage, because little of anything has to be delivered.

Currently, the Binance BTCUSDT futures is where [most cryptocurrency price movement originates from:][39] ([pic](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/btcusdt-volatility-transmission.png))

We can see this directly in the data. Here is a [10min slice of Binance's orderbook chart][40] of Binance BTC ""spot"" (buy orders yellow, sell orders green) and BTC perpetual futures (teal and purple). ([pic](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/orderbook_example-1.png))

I encourage you to open this chart in high resolution in a separate tab and closely look at it.

You can see the [bid-ask spread][41] for both order books move around as the price goes up and down. This bid-ask spread in each market is provided by similar bots as the ones exploiting price spreads between the markets.

First, note how unstable the futures book is compared to the spot. The spot trades within a flat range, then jumps up or down to correct and realign itself with the futures price.

This is common behavior - the futures market trade with so much more leverage, and hence volatility. Futures price movement [""leads"" the spot price movement][42] much of the time.

Also note that the futures price is slightly below the spot price. This is [normal backwardation][43], and common in futures contracts prices.

#### Automated Markets

The crypto market also reacts instantly to relevant news. Amazon released their denial of the CryptoAM story at 15:59EST (19:59UTC). If you had a bloomberg terminal you'd have [seen this](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bloomberg-news.png).

Amazon makes these releases at the end of NASDAQ trading hours. This is normal if you have to announce news important to your stock price. It's polite to give your shareholders time to think overnight before responding to important news.

On the other hand, crypto markets trade around the clock. High frequency trading bots reacted to the Amazon news in <5ms. Here are the order books [around the event][44] ([pic](ttps://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/amazon_drop-3.png)).

The price instantly drops in all markets. Market makers also show themselves to be fair weather friends - the order book vanishes instantly on the news of Amazon's denial.

Not only that, the market is good at differentiating false news from real ones [footnote]or Bloomberg terminal curators are at least[/footnote]. The market didn't react to the fake CityAM article. It instantly corrected on the Amazon denial. We also see [instant reaction to the tether DOJ news][45]

# July 26th 00AM: Sharp price rise

Around Midnight UTC on the 26th, there's an intense rise in price, leading to the liquidation event at 1AM UTC. Here's the [15min period before the liquidation event][46] ([pic](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sharp_rise.png))

We can't track the origin of the increase in prices leading up to the liquidation spike - none of the products on Binance seem to ""lead"" each other in the data. This leaves two possibilities:

1.  The price rise is organic. Maybe people woke up in China very excited about Bitcoin and Amazon!

2.  The price rise comes from price manipulation, but elsewhere. The classic way to manipulate a price is wash trading([1][47], [2][48]), where you both buy and sell to yourself at increasing (or decreasing) prices.

Wash trading works best when the market is thin. If your above-fair-price wash trades run into real orders from other traders, you'll lose money! You want to maximize the likelihood that you actually sell to yourself.

  **An aside on NFTs;** Because they're ""unique"" objects, NFTs are a perfect vehicle for wash trading. You can easily ensure you only wash trade to yourself. The common scheme is to wash trade with yourself until some credible dunce buys the NFT from you at your manufactured ""fair"" value, leaving you to walk away with real money.

If someone wanted to manipulate the price of bitcoin to approach a liquidation point, the origin point would not be a large and liquid order book like Binance BTC or ETH. The wash trading would happen at an illiquid and thin market, and the price movement would then propagate to Binance through arbitrage bots.

# July 26th 1AM: Liquidation Event

At 1AM UTC, the liquidation spike starts. [Here are the BTC orderbooks for the 4min period around the mass liquidation][49].

The event starts with a suspicious series of orders in the futures market, which we'll get into later. Then, a big price spike, with futures order book collapsing into chaos. The bid-ask spreads for both markets blow up.

We can't know which orders in this chart are liquidation orders and which are ""real"" ones - Binance [doesn't provide this data anymore][50] since the April 18th liquidation event.

We can still track what happened, however.

# Momentum Ignition

The manipulative trade pattern to start volatile price movement is called [momentum][51] [ignition][52]. The [ESMA][53] notes that this is marked by high volumes of cancelled orders. Here is the [relevant period's chart][54]. Note this chart also plots actual trades made as black X's on the order books. They were distracting in the other order book plots, but since we talk about order cancellation here it might matter to people digging in.

The way momentum ignition works is by placing a large attractive order, and quickly cancelling it when an opposite order is placed in response. This leaves the opposing order alone in the market, pushing up the price.

[Here is an example from a 20 seconds before the liquidation event][55], where a large attractive sell order is placed, then quickly cancelled when a buy order is placed by a trading bot in response later.

What we see at the event start is such a spoofed order getting placed at 0:59:38 UTC. The price is flat for 2s, but eventually the spot price drifts up. This creates an arbitrage opportunity. Bots place buy orders to arbitrage the sell order.

The sell order is then quickly cancelled, partially filled. The opposing buy order is left buying into a smaller market than expected. This jumps the price up a little, hence the name ""momentum ignition"". Interestingly this is quickly repeated in a ""ladder"" pattern.

This pattern is repeated at the [critical moment before everything explodes][56]

We see one small cancelled sell order (almost unfilled), followed by a very large sell order cancelled (partially filled), then implosion of the markets.

### Market making bots stopping

The second part contributing to the implosion of the futures market is the shutoff of market maker bots around 2.5s after the largest cancelled ""momentum ignition"" order. Here is the same plot as before in a [""flattened"" view][57].

We see the futures bid/ask spread holds for around 2s after the cancelled order. Then, instantly, the bots supplying the ask side are shut off. A gap develops between the bids and asks in the futures market. The spot market remains orderly.

In a few more seconds, around 1:00:40, the futures order book collapse into chaos. This starts dragging the spot market with it - notice the widening of spot bid-ask spreads. In a few more seconds, the futures prices are spiking all around the place between $40,000 and $48,000.

  **An aside on tether:** This shows why in the event where USDT breaks its dollar peg, a near-instantaneous market crash would happen. Because USDT denominates the volatile futures price but not the spot price, an arbitrage gap opens up. However, those bots are wired to assume the dollar parity, and thus are broken in this case. They will be quickly turned offline.The bots turning offline cause a low-liquidity environment in which the USD/USDT price parity correction happens.

# How market manipulation is done

So the ""market manipulation"" in this event is done in two steps:

1.  Spoofed orders that are quickly cancelled when opposing orders try to arbitrage them. This causes some ""momentum ignition"". These seem to be done in a ladder-like sequence.

2.  Turning off market-making bots at a critical juncture to ensure the thinnest possible liquidity environment for forced liquidations to happen in.

In this case, short sellers are liquidated and forced to close positions (placing buy orders). In the thin and chaotic futures order book that was created, this maximally increases the trading price, thus cascading liquidations.

We're unable to trace the sharp price increase preceding the momentum ignition event. So even though it may be caused by something nefarious, we can't confirm it.

# Whodunnit?

 **A note on attribution:** Any allegations made below are mine and mine alone. I don't even think the party responsible for this event have done anything illegal. Cryptocurrency markets are a lawless wasteland! They are the winners, and the retail traders getting liquidated are the losers.


Here are my conclusion relating to attribution:

**Most likely [Alameda Research][58]. Possibly some other algorithmic crypto trading firm, specifically [DRW Cumberland][59] or [Jump Crypto][60]**

It's reasonable to assume whoever planted the CityAM piece is related to the ones manipulating the price. However, the CityAM team does not respond to requests for comments, so this is a dead end[footnote]It's also possible the media manipulation came from a different entity than the one doing momentum ignition. Both may simply have seen the opportunity and acted on it independently. This seems to have happened in the Febuary 2021 liquidation event, where the media manipulators kept going for a week after the liquidation spike[/footnote].

Whoever has done this is a well capitalized, sophisticated algorithmic trading firm. They have been doing this sort of stuff for a long time. The orders leading into the liquidation event are precisely coordinated by algorithms that take a long time to develop and fine-tune.

Both DRW and Alameda fit this description. Both have been unsuccessfully dragged into court for similar behavior ([DRW lawsuit][61], [Alameda lawsuit][62]). It's possible, though less likely, some smaller algorithmic trading shops like [jump crypto][60] or [wintermute][63] fit this bill.

**Look at who profits**

There are two ways to profit from such a liquidation event:

1.  Take a long position before liquidating the short sellers. This doesn't help us narrow it down.

2.  Profit from the mayhem by having a bot arbitrage spreads in the broken order books.

As found in the excellent [tether papers][64] by Protos, both Alameda an DRW Cumberland commonly issue new USDT in high volatility events. You can manually trace these issuances on [TRON][65] and [ETH][66]. Digging into it, you will notice no new USDT have been issued prior or during the July 26th liquidation event.

This rules the ""arbitrage profit"" explanation out. Someone had to place large bets before triggering the liquidations.

**Circumstantial evidence**

If we can't find new USDT being used to profit from the event, can we see suspicious movement on some blockchains that help us attribute it?

The answer is yes. [Here is a list][67] of suspicious transactions. They are large one-way USDT transfers to Binance totalling $290m between July 25th 16:00 UTC and 20:00UTC ([1][68], [2][69], [3][70], [4][71], [5][72], [6][73], [7][74], [8][75]) ([suspicious picture](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-08-at-7.50.59-PM.png)).

Most of these addresses are payment rails to Binance. Algorithmic traders use such blockchain payment rails to move crypto between exchanges.

The simplest way to trace ownership of an address like this is to look at the first transaction. Here, the first inflows are from FTX and Huobi. FTX is owned by Alameda Trading and often used as their asset custodian[footnote]For instance, when Alameda issues new USDT they always send it to FTX first[/footnote]. The best guess then is that these $290m were sent to Binance from Alameda, right before the abrupt price rise and liquidation event.

This is bad economics because increases in the labor pool does not, outside of highly atypical situations, cause economic growth. Otherwise, people would be begging for open door immigration and the unemployment rate would be cheered when growing.

Even viewed more favorably (focusing on the wider possible skills available, the greater supply allowing producers cheaper labor) it's pretty clear that there's not going to be anywhere near a 1:1 parity of labor supply and growth.

Last, it ignores the fact that there's sort of a structural trade-off. Those women entering the workforce weren't just barefoot and pregnant, but barefoot, pregnant, and in the kitchen, and providing a labor outside of nominal economic registers that still has to be provided somehow.

575,69b65l,2017-05-05,badeconomics,AHCA Repealing the tax on tanning beds is bad econ,"Originally written for Facebook, so this is written in non-technical language. 

TL;DR Republicans believe in redistribution of wealth but only for rich people who want to be orange. 

The AHCA repeals the tax that Obamacare levied on tanning beds. 

Assume there is some price, P1 that people pay for health insurance. In a vaccum, given competive, acutuarially fair rates, this is equal to Total Costs of N people / N people, and each person is charged TC(N)/N, multiplied by some risk coefficient, adjusting the percentage of costs that you pay based on your level of sickness. Insurance companies do have SOME ability to discriminate based on usage (they can see your medical history/you tell them you have diabetes, so they charge you a bit more). 

Assume there is some price, P2, that people pay for tanning. Tanning increases your risk of skin cancer by some percentage, multiplied by the cost of skin cancer, makes tanners more expensive by T$ on average. In order to tan, a tanner pays P2, and receives some benefit (they like being tanned), call it B1. They do not pay T$. T$ is paid by the entire insurance pool, divided by the N people in it. 

Given the high costs of medical care, it is extrordinarily likely T$+P2>B1. In English, the private and social costs of tanning exceed the private benefit (there is no public benefit, I don't gain anything from you tanning). 

This means that because people who tan do not pay the full cost of their tanning habits, others do. They will tan more than they would if they had to pay the true price of their tanning. You will go from paying P1 for insurance to P1+T$/(N). So that someone else can tan. 

There is no mechanism by which an insurance company can tell if you use a tanning booth. They cannot adjust your premiums in order to charge you for it. The cost is averaged among all members of the pool. Lie detector tests aren't valid and the insurance industry can't afford to hire Private Detectives to tail all their customers to see if they tan. 

This is an externality. If there is not some outside actor (Government, local warlord, God, Fairy Queen, not my department) who imposes a tanning tax, then some asshole is tanning on your dime. The market cannot, under present legal frameworks, internalize this externality. (I suppose it is possible in a very Coasean legal system, insurance companies would be permitted to sue/otherwise recoup costs from tanning salons). 

There should be a tax on (tanning/smoking cigarettes/running around in circles because being dizzy is fun) equivalent to T$, so that the amount of tanning decreases to the socially optimal level, so that if you choose to tan, you pay what it actually costs to tan.

Just to preface this, I largely agree with the sentiment of Noah's overall post, but the evidence he uses to back up his claims isn't sufficient enough to match his claims imo. 

To start, he begins with a photo showing that the percent of economists who say that they agree with the statement ""Do min wages substantially decrease employment"" (paraphrased) has been decreasing over the years. To be clear, this is *not* the same as saying that they disagree with the statement either. In fact, the [2015 IGM poll](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/15-minimum-wage/) has a scale and a confidence weighting *for that exact reason. It *is* the case that economists are more likely to favor minimum wage increases, but $15 is a dramatic increase and in fact, in the latest poll about the $15 minimum wage, a whopping 15 of the 37 who responded indicated that they were completely uncertain about the sign of the effects and even more were uncertain of the actual magnitude of the effects. 

> I don't think the evidence supports the bold prediction that employment will be substantially lower. Not impossible, but no strong evidence. ~ Autor

> Low levels of minimum wage do not have significant negative employment effects, but the effects likely increase for higher levels. ~ Acemoglu

> The total increase is so big that I'm not sure previous studies tell us very much. ~ Maskin

> Our elasticity estimates provide only local information about labor demand functions, giving little insight into such a large increase. ~ Samuelson

> Lower, yes. ""Substantially""? Not clear. For small changes in min wage, there are small changes in employment. But this is a big change ~ Udry

The next piece of bad evidence is his handwaving away of Dube's suggestion of 58% of the median wage as a local minimum wage. Here is his excerpt

> Fortunately, there’s reason to think that small towns won’t be so screwed by a too-high minimum wage. The reason is that these small towns also tend to have fewer employers, and therefore more monopsony power. And as we saw above, more monopsony power means that minimum wage is less dangerous, and can even raise employment sometimes.

> A [recent study by Azar et al.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3416016) confirms this simple theoretical intuition. They find that in markets with fewer employers — where you’d expect employers’ market power to be stronger — minimum wage has a more benign or beneficial effect on jobs

Looking at the paper, this is not sufficient evidence that a $15 minimum wage will have a small or zero disemployment effect on small or poorer localities. For one, using [bains data](https://i.imgur.com/Q3f5ofi.png) and [pop weighted data](https://i.imgur.com/93ceGYZ.png) there are a significant number of localities where 50% of the median wage is quite lower than $10. That is 33% less than a $15 mw. The Azar paper finds that minwage earning elasticities much smaller than this and to back Noah's theory, it'd have to be the case that labor market concentration pushes down wages in such a massive way. Beyond that, the Azar paper warns not make the exact external validity claim that Noah is making! 

> One possible area of concern for an omitted variable bias arises from the fact that HHIs tend to be higher in more rural areas (Azar et al., 2018) while rural areas are plausibly less productive.  Independent of labor market concentration measures, then, this productivity difference might affect employment responses to the minimum wage.  Our expectation, however, would be that the minimum wage depresses employment more in less productive areas because in-creases in the minimum wage above the federal level are more likely to result in local minimum wages above workers’ marginal productivity.  This kind of bias goes against our finding that the minimum wage tends to increase employment in the most concentrated areas. 

There are attempts to control for it using population density, but the fact remains that the argument about disemployment that Noah is making simply might not apply for such a large change in the federal minimum wage in smaller localities. 

Noah ends with this quote:

> When the evidence is clear, true scientists follow the evidence. 

That's probably a little too overzealous when applied to this specific situation. While the evidence is clear about the pervasiveness of monopsony, it's definitely not clear that 1) economists are well on board with a $15 mw, and 2) that it will have a small/negligible effect on low wage communities.

Edit: It looks like [Noah does still believe that](https://twitter.com/Motoconomist/status/1350218312022687746?s=20) a $15 MW would have disemployment effects on rural communities, but that it will be lessened by his concentration argument. I was clearly not the only one who felt his language did not match that claim so I'll leave it as a point that still stands.",BespokeDebtor,t2_1ulabqy0,0.96,295,185
578,fsskb4,2020-04-01,badeconomics,Incel theory is internally inconsistent and can be disproven using reverse game theory,"#Introduction: 

I was talking to a friend of mine before econ class, and somehow the topic turned to [incels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incel). So we're talking about them, then he says these words:

""Incels are just dudes with no game.""

Writing it out mathematically, the statement becomes, ""If you are an incel, you are a dude with no game"", so the [contrapositive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraposition) implies that if you could somehow give ""game"" to an incel, the incel would cease to be an incel. But I wager that if even if you somehow found a large number of [Hitches](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386588/) to give them ""game"", it would be completely ineffective, as the incel mindset is, at its core, anti-woman. At the basis of the ideology is a fundamental objectification of women, simply turning them into objects of use, and hence an incel would likely use that ""game"" to commit harm against women.

So we can't use ""game"", but still, how can we help incels, or at least prevent other people from believing their ideology and becoming incels themselves?

*Teach all people reverse game theory, also known as mechanism design.* 

#Background: 

Immediately, the question is why teaching people mechanism design will help with the incel problem. This is because incel theory has a huge mechanism design flaw. 

See, according to incel theory, [women](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/ffel57/nature_has_not_destined_them_as_the_weaker_sex_to/) [constantly](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/e306om/they_are_lying_with_their_mouth_but_their_actions/) [lie](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/ennpri/she_lied_to_me_twice_she_said_ive_seen_many/) [to](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/f0k5qa/women_are_unconscious_liars_who_dont_even/) [men](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/au6rph/redditor_claims_that_all_women_lie_and_manipulate/), [putting](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/b7vp7d/they_often_lie_about_how_looks_attracts_them_to_a/) [on](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/bs5lwe/youre_lying/) [a](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/cto4qj/women_are_driven_to_rely_not_on_force_but_on/) [show](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/cvilte/women_cant_be_interesting_if_one_seems/) that they're good people, when they [actually](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/fh3htn/i_got_tired_of_lying_and_told_him_the_truth_he/) just want to use men for various things. If a man is ""trapped"" in a relationship with them, women reveal that they're actually hideous [beasts](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/c6ko96/caring_supporting_and_loving_women_dont_exist_and/) simply out to use and harm men.

That is bad economics, specifically bad mechanism design. Using the aforementioned assumptions, we will prove that incel theory is internally inconsistent.

#The Model: 

Let's create the setting. We have one lady, whom we will denote as W. There are N guys who are attracted to her, and want to become her boyfriend. She will only have one boyfriend. 

The key thing to note is that *each guy does not know how much he actually values a relationship a relationship with W*. This is because W may seem great in public, but in private and in a relationship she may be completely different. Maybe she's just putting on an act, like incel theory states.

So the guys don't know their exact values (V) of a relationship with W, but they have expected values (E(V)), which are dependent on a signal (S) they each receive about W. Maybe the signal is a rumor they heard about her, an Instagram post, whatnot.

We will assume that signals are positively correlated with values. In other words, a high/low signal means it's more likely that a guy's true value of a relationship with W will be high/low. Furthermore, we will assume that each guy's signals and values are ""affiliated"" with the others'. In other words, the higher other guys' signals/values are, the more likely you will have a high signal/value. We can say that in this model, values are interdependent and not independent. Furthermore, signals are drawn from the same distribution for each guy. Finally, every guy is risk-neutral.

Let's take the point of view of one guy who likes W, and there are N-1 other guys. We will let S denote the signal of this guy and Y_i denote the i-th highest signal of the other N-1 guys. So Y_1 is the highest signal of the others, Y_2 is the 2nd-highest, and so on, until Y_{N-1} is the N-1 highest of the others, i.e. the lowest.

Now let's use the incel assumptions to construct the mechanism that decides who becomes W's boyfriend. Accordingly, W is purely materialistic, shallow, and in general a bad person. She only cares about what the guys can do for her, be it buying her food, clothes, and whatnot. Hence, she will only enter a relationship with the guy who is willing to spend the most money on her (maybe there are other things she wants too, but if so let's just take the [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)) to combine those things into one value). This means that each guy will keep trying to do the others in terms of how much they spend on her (assuming that budget constraints do not bind). As each guy declares how much money he will spend on W, this ""raises the cost"" of a relationship with W. Eventually, there will come a point where the expected utility from being in a relationship with W will be negative; this occurs for a guy when the cost is too high. And so he drops out. More and more guys drop out, until there are only 2 guys left in this spending game. Finally, one of the guys will raise the cost just too high for the other guy, and so the other guy drops out, and thus the guy who raised the cost becomes W's boyfriend. The cost to W's boyfriend is thus the point at which the second-to-last guy dropped out.

You may notice that this mechanism sounds almost exactly like W setting up an [English auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_auction). And since this is an English auction, we know from [Vickrey (1961)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1961.tb02789.x) that this is equivalent to a [second-price sealed bid auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction) in equilibrium for independent private values; specifically, the equilibrium cost at which a winner wins is the same across both auctions. However, values here are interdependent, so equilibrium is not exactly the same. However, I will examine the second-price case, because the qualitative result is the same, and it's also easier. Just for robustness though, we'll discuss how the final qualitative result holds when analyzing the English auction perspective.

Now, return to the guy whose POV we are taking. Let [this](https://imgur.com/a/6ygJbiU) be his expected value of a relationship, condition on his signal equaling some $x$, and all the other guys' signals being whatever they are. 

However, remember the setting! If this guy wins, he pays the cost at which the last person among the others dropped out. Furthermore, signals and values are correlated, and due to the symmetry assumption from above, we have that the highest signal equals the highest expected value of a relationship. This means that our specific guy only cares about the signal of the person with the highest signal among the others, because the cost at which that guy drops out is the cost our guy pays. So we can rewrite the condition expected value [in this manner](https://imgur.com/a/N5Bir6i), for some signal y.

Finally, we will let b^*(x) denote the cost one pays if he becomes W's boyfriend, given that his signal is x. So in the second-price sealed bid auction setting, since we are assuming risk neutrality here, [expected utility is like so](https://imgur.com/a/T2GVIMR). Let's draw a graph!

[Cost is on the vertical axis, and the highest signal among the other guys is on the horizontal axis](https://imgur.com/a/YQgQi0J).

Let's suppose our guy shares that signal. Then his cost function will [look something like this](https://imgur.com/a/k3Cdq0K).

Next, we'll graph the expected value of a relationship, [fixing our guy's signal at some positive value x](https://imgur.com/a/IJ2jCgN). Notice that this doesn't start at 0, since one's own signal is positive, so even if others' signals are 0, one will have positive expected value. Right now we won't prove why the slope is less than that of the b function; we'll shiow that later. But the intuition, I think, is clear: your own signal has a higher effect on you than others' signals, and while your own signal is constant in the expected value function, it changes with y in the b function. So the b function has a greater slope.

Now, remember that all the guys are risk neutral, meaning our guy only wants to win when expected value is greater than or equal to cost, or lose when expected value is less than cost. [So we add these labels to our graph, for convenience](https://imgur.com/a/ioSvgBX).

[Now observe that b(y) is another way of writing one's expected value given that your signal, and the highest signal among the others, is y](https://imgur.com/a/PML5fOT). This shows that the slope of the b function is greater than that of the expected value function when S = x.

Anyways, because of the previous observation, [we can characterize the reservation cost, i.e. the cost at which one is indifferent between winning and losing, as b^*(x)](https://imgur.com/a/OUM9Srl).

[And this occurs when one's signal is x](https://imgur.com/a/3Xx3wzx). So, what is the ramification?

Well, because of everything we have shown in the graph's thus far, we can define b^*(x) in terms of condition expected value: [it is the expected value of a relationship, given that highest signal among the others is the same as yours](https://imgur.com/a/nD4NIrK). In other words, for each guy, it is an optimal strategy to act as though everyone else has the same signal as he does, so as to guarantee that he drops out when the cost goes too high, but stays in when it hasn't reached that point yet!

#Proving the Internal Inconsistency of Incel Theory: 

Supposedly, it is in W's interest to lie and hide her true nature from the guys. But does that actually hold, assuming [W is rational and intelligent in the Myersonian, game-theoretic sense](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeegamebe/v_3a3_3ay_3a1991_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a387-391.htm)?

Let's say that W will also get a signal about herself. She can commit to one of two plans: Plan A is to reveal the signal, and Plan B is to not reveal the signal. Remember, her goal is to extract the largest cost out of the guys as possible. So given this objective, which plan is optimal?

Well, let's define new variables. Let X_i define the i-th highest signal overall. So for example, if we take the perspective of the guy with the highest signal, then his signal is X_1, but Y_1 is the next-highest signal, i.e. Y_1 = X_2 in this case.

Let us also define S_W to be the signal that W can choose to revealing or not revealing. Suppose that S_W = w. Then if she chooses to reveal it, a guy with signal x will act according to the above, while also taking into account W's signal, [in this manner](https://imgur.com/a/PHXHKsh).

Incel theory dictates that W's optimal strategy is to commit to not reveal her signal. Now, you may know of the [Linkage Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_principle), as proven by [Milgrom and Weber (1982)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1911865?origin=crossref&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents), which will tell you whether or not incel theory is correct. But we will do a direct proof here. spoiler: incel theory is wrong, and it is actually W's optimal strategy to commit to revealing her signal.

Now we know that W's benefit comes from the cost at which the guy with the second-highest signal drops out. So let us take the perspective of the guy with the second-highest signal.

[We begin with the identity between cost and expected value that was proved earlier](https://imgur.com/a/NYFtIIf).

Next, we will use the [Law of Iterated Expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_expectation). Using the LIE, we get [this next line here](https://imgur.com/a/1aHdcH5).

Next, since the outside conditions have your signal and the highest among the others equal to x, [we will fix those conditions for the inside as well](https://imgur.com/a/qmYEtt8).

[This next line follows from the identity between the b function and conditional expected value](https://imgur.com/a/ypFD6q0).

Next, we know that we are looking from the perspective of the person with the second-highest signal, [and as such S = X_2](https://imgur.com/a/KV50rDN).

Now we shake things up. Suppose that the highest signal of the others is greater than or equal to x. Since all the guys' signals and values are affiliated, it means that now, [the expected cost is greater than or equal to what it was before](https://imgur.com/a/Du12V8g).

Next, [we can simplify the expression like so](https://imgur.com/a/lJiN70F), since S = X_2 = x already implies that the highest signal among the others' is greater than or equal to x.

Finally, we know we're looking at the guy with the second-highest signal, so [we can get rid of the S](https://imgur.com/a/Lo65LNw).

What did we just prove? Remember that the cost W gets from her boyfriend is the cost at which the guy with the second-highest signal dropped out, i.e. his reservation cost. Hence, this proof shows that the reservation cost of the guy with the second-highest signal [is less than or equal to his expected reservation cost, given that W chose to reveal S_W](https://imgur.com/a/qAbLOxL)! QED.

**In other words, it is optimal for W to commit to revealing her signal, which proves that incel theory is internally inconsistent with its assumptions!**

#Discussion: 

The intuition is that the second-highest reservation cost underestimates the true value to that guy of a relationship with W, since the guy with the second-highest signal operates under the assumption that the highest signal among the others equals his. This is false, though, as the highest of the other signals is greater than his, and if he knew that, then his expected value would increase. Hence, by committing to revealing S_W, W corrects for this underestimate and raises, on average, the second-highest reservation cost. This is because her signal is affiliated with the highest other signal.

Now let's loop back to the English perspective. Using the Linkage Principle, it can be proved that English case has an expected cost greater than or equal to the second-price case. Furthermore, W revealing her signal yields the same qualitative result: this is more beneficial to her than hiding her signal.

Hence, teaching people mechanism design will showcase this internal inconsistency in incel theory.

Incel theory is bad, and now we know that not only is it bad morally, but economically as well.",MambaMentaIity,t2_2vu9et4k,0.94,859,147

Bad RedPill Economics Part III: The Final Chapter


&nbsp;

[The article in question](https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/04/03/how-mass-immigration-is-driven-by-female-consumerism-and-low-fertility/)

&nbsp;

This article sucks. Not that I’ve come to expect much from the manosphere when it comes to economics, but this is really something else. Unlike the last article we looked at, this one is written somewhat coherently, which indicates that that the author did have enough self-awareness to at least and try and make his article readable. Yet unfortunately for us, the author was not self-aware enough to realize that he knows nothing about economics. Now I’m just an undergrad, but you don’t need to be Paul Samuelson to see that this is some Bad Economics^TM.  Unsatisfied with just violating the rules of economics, the author has also decided to violate the rules of basic human decency, writing up a racist, sexist, xenophobic manifesto that reads like the love-child of Human Action and Mien Kampf. Let’s dive in.

&nbsp;

**Part I: The Introduction**


What better appetizer for bad economics than some bad math? The author writes

> A recently released report reveals that a full 1 in 5 people in the United States are now either immigrants or their children. The growth of the immigrant population has been occurring at a rate of over 350% since 1965.

Here, the author misleadingly confuses total growth with growth rate, using the phrase “since 1965” to imply that this growth rate has spanned multiple time periods (meaning more immigrants) rather than being the growth rate for a single period: 1965 to the present. 









The author then introduces the main topic of the article

> This tidal wave of immigration has innundated the traditional American population, who have been asleep at the switch thinking that having children is either declasse or an antiquated notion. As a result, they are being demographically replaced in their own nation.

(By the way, unless he’s referring to Native Americans, the idea of a “traditional American population” is some Bad History.) So basically, the author’s saying that white people aren’t having enough babies because of feminism, and so are becoming a minority. Got it.

&nbsp;

**Part II: “The Consumerism Machine”**

 Here’s where the economics gets bad.

> In order to keep a consumption economy that needs perpetual growth running, the political and economic powers in our society need an ever-increasing population. 

 (I’ll let you figure out who the author means by “the political and economic powers in our society.”) 

A cursory look at history demonstrates that this isn’t true. The economies of Japan and Korea underwent periods of massive economic growth with comparatively-small population growth at different points in the past century. I think the author’s arguing that  population growth leads to more consumers, and that more consumers are necessary for economic growth. Apparently people can never increase their standard of living and consume more.

The author then makes a few smaller claims that I’m not going to waste my time on, because he provides no statistics to back them up. Claims such as:

> In the modern age, Western women now marry themselves to a corporation rather than a strapping young man.

Or

> Tragically, women are now looking for child replacements like cats and dogs to silence their maternal instincts.

I wonder who he had in mind when he mentions the “strapping young man” that gets ignored by women…

The author then makes a second claim

> Declining populations are correlated with recessions and depressions while growing populations are correlated with economic growth … Part of the reason the United States and Europe are importing so many immigrants is feminism has rendered white women statistically sterile. Birth rates are not enough to even sustain the population, much less create an engine of economic growth.


I have a feeling that the author is using the word “correlated” to imply causation. Not that it matters, though; there is no evidence that population changes move with the business cycle. The US population has been consistently growing over the course of the past century, during which the US has experienced several recessions. While it’s true that population growth can affect a nation’s standard of living, this is not the same as affecting the business cycle.  It’s also possible that people are less likely to have children during recessions, but this is a change in the rate of population growth, not the total size of the population.

&nbsp;

**Part III: “The Numbers”**

The author then says

> Women refusing to have families and children requires the flood gates of immigration to be swung upen because a consumer economy needs increasing numbers of warm bodies to buy its wares … Low fertility and mass immigration are leading to irreversible demographic change in the United States and Europe.

Once again, no they don’t. There are problems associated with declining populations, but this isn’t one of them.

The author then goes on a tirade about how white Americans are becoming a minority in their own country. But he doesn’t make any economic claims, so I won’t talk much about this part. The author does hint at where he’s going with this article, saying

> It seems in today’s world, destroying national sovereingty and cultures to turn people into shopping fools is an acceptable strategy by government in service of the corporate bottom line … Cultures are lost, nations are lost, but people can buy lots of shiny things they do not need.

So apparently governments are promoting consumerism… somehow in a conspiracy to enrich corporations. How exactly is the government doing this? The answer is… 

&nbsp;

**Part IV: “Free Market”**

… feminism. Of course. 

> The need for mass immigration to the West has been caused by feminism, and feminism was designed by a collusion of corporate and government interests to take women out of the home and turn them into corporate cogs and taxpayers.

This is a case of reverse causation. Modern feminism was in large part a result of women gaining economic clout because they began wage labor. Getting more women in the workplace only became a major part of feminism much later on. Once again, the author provides no evidence for his claims, and doesn’t specify which corporations are colluding with which government interests. 

The author then makes another economic claim:

> The rise of corporate monopolies and the disproportionate power they (using their government servants) exert over the lives of the average person is a corruption of the free economic market. In a free-market economy, prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy, and it typically entails support for highly competitive markets and private ownership of productive enterprises … Adam Smith knew that a completely unregulated market would see the rise of monopolies (like today’s corporate monopolies) and was therefore not free … The problem is instead of preventing monopolies as it should, the government has aided and abetted them.

First of all, monopolies have not become more prevalent. If anything, they’ve become less prevalent compared to during the late 19th and early 20th century as the field of antitrust law has developed.

We don’t even need to use a model to explain why the author is wrong here; he has confused the definition of “free market” with “perfectly competitive market.” Perfectly-competitive markets are characterized by a large number of buyers and sellers such that no one buyer or seller can influence the price of a commodity. It has nothing to do with government policy or private property. And while there exist certain “natural monopolies” and situations in which monopolies can occur in the absence of regulation, there is no rule that states all markets tend towards monopoly. 

The author concludes this part by saying

> One of the problems created by the unchecked consolidation of corporations, in addition to the issue of converging interests corrupting government and subverting the will of the people on matters like immigration, is wage gutting.

&nbsp;

**Part V: “Wage Gutting”**

> Corporate interests support increasing legal immigration even further, which has one major benefit for them: cheap labor … This is yet another example of the corporate-government complex at work. The tech industry doesn’t want to pay workers what they are worth, so they lobby Congress for increasing immigration to suppress wages.

While it’s true that corporations want more high-skilled immigrants in part because they are willing to work for lower wages, this is an odd criticism considering the author’s praise of perfectly-competitive markets in the previous section. In a perfectly-competitive labor market, workers are paid their marginal product, i.e. what they are “worth,” in purely economic terms. (Whether labor markets are truly perfectly competitive is another story.) An increase in the labor supply, say from immigration, would decrease each worker’s marginal product of labor, meaning that each worker would be “worth” less and would therefore be paid less. If anything, restricting immigration would make the labor market less perfectly competitive, because perfect competition implies easy market entrance and exit. 

&nbsp;

**Part VI: ""Environmental Impact""**

Next, the author talks about how female consumerism is supposedly being fueled by fiat currency

> As Stefan Molyneux has pointed out, if there was truly an effort to end overconsumption to solve the problem of global warming, world leaders would be saying the following about fiat currency and central banking: We must end fiat currency, we must end central banking around the world. Because central banking and the continued overprinting of currency and the taking on of national debt is causing a vast overconsumption of nature’s scarce resources. This should be the central and fundamental and irrefutable argument for ending central banking and returning to a gold standard. In short, fiat currency causes overconsumption. The need for fiat currency is caused by an economy that caters to women, who make 4 out of 5 purchasing decisions in a consumerism-driven waste economy. And the economy is supported by population growth which is no longer occurring in traditionally white nations since the feminist movement. It’s the perfect storm.

Now things are starting to get incoherent. What does central banking have to do with consumerism? The author seems to be arguing that the government is using monetary policy to incrase consumption and grow the economy. But if we accept that money is neutral in the long run, then monetary policy can only affect consumption and output in the short term, and not in the long term. 

&nbsp;

**Part VII: ""Men Failed As Guardians""**

Now that he’s whipped himself up into a frenzy, the author goes completely off the rails

> There have been warnings going back thousands of years in Western literature about the societal costs of not giving women proper direction. This is perhaps illustrated nowhere better than this type of economy cannibalizing Western civilization. Proverbs 31:3 is a good example of this ancient wisdom: “Do not give your strength to women, your ways to those who destroy kings.” 

First of all, Proverbs is from the Hebrew Bible, yet somehow that counts as “Western literature.” And I wouldn’t really call the above quote “ancient wisdom,” but that’s just me.

Then, the author goes full-on 19th Century racist and gives us this gem of bad politics:

> Conservatives are the more crucial linchpin to civilization. Without liberals, we might have worse movies and fewer charming coffee shops. But without conservatives, we might have no civilization at all, having handed over the keys to the White kingdom to babbling barbarians.  

Wew lad.











Then, to top it off, he shares with us some bad history:

> In normal historical cycles, the warrior would ascend in times of decadence and social disconnection to bring balance to the force. But these are not normal times. Feminism, the ideological spawn of Satan and his thousand reptillian succubi, thwarts the natural ascendency of the warrior class, allowing the shitlib devolution to continue unhindered and unchecked.

So apparently the ascension of “the warrior” is supposed to save civilization. What is this, Borderlands 2? Was this article written by Handsome Jack? Somehow I doubt the “handsome” part. However, I do think the “Jack” part rings true; as we’ve seen on our journey together today, the author clearly knows jack shit about economics.

First, a couple of definitions. Quantitative Easing is the ultimate form of expansionary monetary policy, where the central bank creates money to purchase securities. It's done when further conventional monetary policy is likely to be ineffective, such as when interest rates are already close to zero. In the ISLM model, QE shifts the IS curve to the right, whereas conventional monetary policy exclusively affects the LM curve. 

Modern Monetary Theory is the idea that any government that issues its own currency has no need for debt - any fiscal expansion can be financed through simply creating more money. While the basic concept is technically correct, it's not regarded as a viable policy in most circles, as its proponents usually don't consider the inflationary effects of monetary financing. 

>central banks worldwide are ... effectively implementing MMT (Modern Monetary Theory)

There's a crucial difference between monetary financing and quantitative easing - the aim of the policy. Monetary financing aims to bankroll fiscal policy, irrespective of the inflationary effects. Quantitative easing aims to force capital out of safer investments by depressing yields, thereby making it easier for firms to raise capital, which in turn increases investment, 
 and stimulates inflation and growth. While this may make expansionary fiscal policy cheaper, it's a side effect, not a goal. 

>The reality is that MMT is poorly named. It is not a theory and should be called Modern Monetary Practice (MMP) because, at its core, its central proposition is that it describes what central banks do.

Again - no central bank in a developed economy is currently engaging in monetary financing. Every sustained bond-buying program in modern times has always occurred when inflation and cash rates are >1%, and ceases as soon as the economy returns to long run equilibrium. It's a way of bridging the gap to avoid capital flight from risky investments. 

>Looking at the actual practise of creating new money, let’s say to finance an infrastructure project such as a railway, there are elements of the PPP (Public Private Partnership). The Government issues bonds. The banks buy the bonds. Meanwhile, the RBA stands in the market ready to buy the bonds from the banks. When the RBA buys the bonds, new money is created.

>It could issue $5 billion worth of bonds. The banks and other investors would buy them. Then the Reserve Bank would create $5 billion in new currency by crediting their accounts when it buys the bonds from the banks.

>The upshot? The Government has raised $5 billion worth of funds from the banks for its infrastructure project and the RBA has created another $5 billion which the banks can now lend to the private sector, perhaps to finance their contribution to the railway PPP.

Let's look at this through the AS-AD and IS-LM models. Under this model, an economy's medium run equilibrium output (Y\*) is set just before the slope of the aggregate supply curve starts getting increasingly steep. The role of most central banks is to keep the economy at Y\*, and its main mechanism to do so is through influencing investment, and therefore demand. The central bank's tools for achieving this are either through changing the money supply (shifting the LM curve) or changing the investment level (shifting the IS curve). A large bond purchase would manifest as a change in the investment level. 

If output was below Y\*, expansionary monetary policy would be beneficial. You'd see an increase in output with little effect on prices. Overall welfare would increase. However, if the economy is at or above Y\*, you'd see a small increase in output accompanied by a disproportionately large increase in inflation, hurting the economy and workers. Long story short, the key factor when deciding whether monetary expansion is beneficial is whether the economy is at Y\*. QE works this way, MMT doesn't. 

>To complete the circle, if we assume the Reserve Bank has bought some of the bonds and held them to maturity, then Mathias Cormann’s grandchildren will pay their tax and the money will go to the bondholder, this time the Reserve Bank. It then pays the money back to the Government, this time as a dividend, ergo more money for infrastructure

---

Wew, let's take this one step at a time:

> It's very probable slavery wasn't actually economically beneficial because it hindered industrialization.

I'm sympathetic to arguments that slavery made it so that the South found it more difficult to develop a manufacturing industry as it could simply depend on imports from the North.[[1]](https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2013/09/27/did-slavery-make-economic-sense) However, this assumes a counterfactual: that the South would have definitely developed strong industry without slaves. This is possible, but the south had a comparative advantage in large-scale agriculture in the first place because of its more fertile soils that could grow cash crops such as tobacco, cotton, and sugar. The latter two crops especially could not as easily grow in the North, which primarily had subsistence farms.[[2]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1836733.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A5b51c4e34434aadb2c217db1f19ad87f) Think about it this way: why didn't the South use slavery in manufacturing? Agriculture might have been more profitable anyway. Moreover, the largest ports in the U.S. were in the North (closer to the U.S.'s largest trading partners in Europe), and this could have benefited manufacturing independent of the North not having slaves.[[3]](https://www.nber.org/papers/w4710.pdf) If you don't buy that argument, there are plenty of other reasons why the North could have developed manufacturing even if the South did not have slaves. For example, nascent industries like newspaper circulation and hog packing boomed during Jefferson's trade embargo, which were more highly concentrated in the North.[[4]](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dirwin/docs/ip.pdf)

> You know the south was always poorer than it's northern counterparts, right?

* In 1860, the two richest states in the United States—per capita—were Mississippi and South Carolina.[[5]](https://books.google.com/books/about/Men_and_Wealth_in_the_United_States_1850.html?id=Za8rAQAAIAAJ) 
* ""In 1860, the economic value of slaves in the United States exceeded the invested value of all of the nation's railroads, factories, and banks combined.""[[6]](https://www.nps.gov/articles/industry-and-economy-during-the-civil-war.htm)
* The North *did* have more people than the south and estimates on all these figures certainly tend to vary[[7]](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~webfac/cromer/e211_f12/LindertWilliamson.pdf) (note also ""We also find that the South was initially much richer than the North on
the eve of Revolution,"") but it's definitely not settled that the south was always poorer.
* ""In 1860, 5 of the 10 wealthiest states in the US are slave states; 6 of the top 10 in per capita wealth; calculated just by white population, 8 of 10. The single wealthiest county per capita was Adams County, Mississippi. As a separate nation in 1860, the South by itself would have been the world's 4th wealthiest, ahead of everyone in Europe but England. Italy did not enjoy an equivalent level of per capita wealth until after WWII; the South's per capita growth rate was 1.7%, 1840-60, 1/3 higher than the North's and among the greatest in history.""[[8]](http://inside.sfuhs.org/dept/history/US_History_reader/Chapter5/southernecon.html) I know this isn't the best source, it traces itself to [this](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/king-cottons-long-shadow/) and subsequently [this book](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674975385&content=reviews) but I can't find a direct source on it. Would love a discussion about this in the comments. Nonetheless, I think the general point holds.

> And, up until the last 40 years, Canada (which had almost 0 slaves in its entirety) was quite a bit wealthier than the US?

I'm going to talk about GDP per capita instead of wealth per se, but in 1960 (almost 60 years ago), the U.S. had a higher GDP per capita than Canada.[[9]](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?name_desc=false) I don't have the PPP adjusted data that far back, but it's curious to me that current levels don't matter suddenly and what really matters when talking about the effect of slavery on economic growth is ""up until the last 40 years."" Is the argument here that all countries with lower numbers of slaves are wealthier than countries with more slaves? Brazil had many more slaves than Paraguay and is wealthier than Paraguay today, off the top of my head. Either way, this is a poor argument. Talk about omitted variable bias.

> You actually have to be [redacted] to think the west is affluent because it used some forced labor, seeing as how every continent in the history of the world had rampant slavery anyways.

Don't use the R-word.

> ""This will kill Canadian jobs because he’s pursuing a policy to tax dirty industry and chase it from Canada.""

 This really isn’t what Trudeau is doing. He’s pursuing policies to reduce emissions and foster innovation in cleaner technologies. An example of innovation already going on is 13 of the oil sand producers who hold 90% of the market in Canada working together to come up with clean technologies to reduce the environmental impact of oil sands. “dirty industry” doesn’t have to leave Canada, they just need to **clean** up their [act to maintain competitiveness](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian-framework/complementary-actions-reduce-emissions.html#3_6). Each region in Canada also has a lot of flexibility to implement policies to best suit their regions, and revenues gained will remain in their jurisdiction to be recycled back to those who are most negatively impacted by the [carbon pricing policies.](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian-framework/introduction.html)
It is also worth mentioning that Canada’s framework on clean growth and climate change has [complementary policies and actions to reduce emissions](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian-framework/complementary-actions-reduce-emissions.html#3_6) such as electrification of public transport, increasing renewable and non-emitting energy sources, making new and existing buildings more energy efficient and investing in technologies to help industries reduce their emissions. 

>""China does not have an equivalent tax""

China is one of the biggest clean energy advocates, it was announced in 2015 by the Chinese president that an Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) would be introduced at the beginning of 2017. This has been shaped by the evolving pilot ETS schemes China has introduced in Beijing, Chongqing, Guangdong, Hubei, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Tianjin. 7 of the 10 worlds biggest economies will have carbon pricing initiatives which is estimated to cover around 25% of global emissions by 2020.

>""You can’t just ship ALL industry out of Canada. There will be no jobs left. Time has come where we need to stand up on our own two feet and see domestic manufacturing flourish.""

DAE miss crappy manufacturing jobs? [Here](http://imgur.com/a/cK9hd) is a low effort excel graph (data retrieved from OECDstat) showing employment in manufacturing falling by half from 1970-2008 and rates of total unemployment doing its own thing, sitting around 7% for the most part. It’s an old argument but no, employment in manufacturing in developing countries has been and will continue to decline, this isn't a bad thing. MechEng blogger’s reason to stop the implementation of carbon pricing initiatives to reduce emissions isn’t a good argument at all.

He focuses on the cost to some industries and completely ignores the social costs that carbon emissions impart on society. Although there is a wide range of estimates for the marginal social cost per metric tonne of C02 emissions from $3-95, it is agreed that there are social marginal damages (costs) of GHG emissions. It should also be noted that these estimates are likely to be underestimated due to the difficulty of quantifying many impacts, and they are likely to increase over time. Short run estimates using MITs EPPA model of a $15 carbon tax imposed on the whole of the United States estimates an 8.4% reduction of the 6000 million metric tonnes of C02 emissions emitted in 2005, and a nearly 50% reduction in other GHG emissions. [see here](http://www.nber.org/papers/w14375.pdf) I know this is a study done in the USA but I think it is a nice example.

Hope this is decent enough, if not, I learned a lot about carbon pricing on this little journey and it was a lot of fun.

This new tax will be between 2% to 3.5% of the worth of assets within Argentina of every person whose assets in Argentina are worth more 200 million pesos (about 2.5 millon dollars at the current official exchange rate, far less in the real world exchange rate). 

This new tax is bad economics because iliquid assets are not exempt, and debts are not deducted. This means that people who have to pay the tax have to sell assets such as bonds and company shares, or demand high dividends in order to pay the tax. Not to mention people who borrow a lot of money have to pay tax on money they borrow even if they are broke. This tax also applies to any investment anyone makes in Argentina, so it makes it completely unprofitable to invest in the country. And although the tax is one-time for the time being, Argentinian history is full of emergency taxes that ended up being permanent.

Fortunately, there is already the Personal Assets tax which is very similar to the new wealth tax but exempts some iliquid assets such as company shares and bonds, so this new wealth tax might be ruled as unconstitutional for taxing the same thing twice. But our Supreme Court tends to side with the government and our government already violates the Constitution all the time so it's not a safe bet that this new tax gets thrown out of the window. If the new wealth tax sticks, it absolutely destroy Argentina's economy as everyone takes all their investment out of the country and all wealthy residents leave in droves.

593,65netx,2017-04-16,badeconomics,r/philosophy guide on sweatshops and developmental economics,"[Here is the permalink](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/65dfvv/matt_zwolinski_explains_how_sweatshops_help_the/dg9d7r6/)

**My lazy R1** 

I believe we have crossed the threshold of philosophy and into economics here. These sweatshops are a symptom of poverty, not the cause. /u/red-cloak your response is bad economics and flat out wrong, going against both empirical evidence and the consensus among economists. From the worker's prospective isn't choosing between college, a white collar job or a sweatshop, it's between farming for .50 cents an hour vs. working for Nike for a 1$ an hour. I don't see why the latter raises your sense of indignation and not the former.


As far as the ""alternative"" such as a UBI, keep dreaming, these are countries with GDP per capita of 5000$ or less. Let me put that to you in real terms. India with a GDP per capita of 2,900 $ has 100,000 cases of leprosy. One $3 dose of antibiotics will cure a mild case, $20 for a more severe one. WHO provides these drugs for free, but the health care infrastructure is not good enough to identify the afflicted and get them the medicine they need. So, more than 100,000 Indians are left horribly disfigured by a disease that costs $3 to cure. That's what it means to have a GDP per capita of $2,900. Your idea of some type of UBI is utterly unworkable in the countries we're talking about. Hands down, strong economic growth that comes from globalization, sweatshops and connect to the world economy has done great things for the world's poor. (Wheelen 2010)


Cheap Exports, and hence sweatshops have been the basis for the prosperity enjoyed by the Asian Tigers. You fail to take not that markets are voluntary, Nike is not using forced labor. If sweatshops paid decent wages by Western standards, they would not exist their comparative advantage is their cheap labor. You're confusing cause and effect, when you talk about Exploitation, the implicate assumption being sweatshops cause low wages. Sweatshops do not cause low wages in poor countries; rather, they pay low wages because those countries offer workers so few other alternatives. You might was well hurl rocks at a hospitals because sick people suffer there.


For the record, on your alternative of what happens when you close sweatshops. Renowned economist Paul Krugman has something to say: *"" In 1993, child workers in Bangladesh were found to be producing clothing for Wal-Mart and Senator Tom Harkin proposed legislation banning imports from countries employing underage workers. The direct result was that Bangladeshi textile factories stopped employing children. But did the children go back to school? Did they return to happy homes? Not according to Oxfam, which found that the displaced child workers ended up in even worse jobs, or on the streets-and that a significant number were forced into prostitution."" *

The Fed Up Campaign  who in their attempts to protest the fed actually are endorsing their actions. I wish I hate the time to breakdown there almost impressive inaccuracy on their main website
[So I discovered the group from this story](http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/article98041112.html#emlnl=Midday_Business_Report#storylink=cpy)
> The group, some wearing T-shirts bearing the slogan, ""We Need a People's Fed!"" posed questions about economic policy and the need for diversity to the Fed officials who took part in the 90-minute discussion.
""Our communities are being sacrificed for an inflation enemy that isn't here,"" said Rod Adams, a community organizer for Neighborhoods for Change in Minnesota.

Surprise, surprise they kind of agree with the group here. The Fed has a dual mandate of price stability *and* maximum employment  which means both are concerns for them. They specifically targets a rate of 2% inflation, and the current actual inflation rate in February this year was [1.02%](https://www.google.com/#q=inflation+rates+for+2015). 

The estimated full employment rate in the US which is estimated from being anywhere from 4.5%-5.5%. Which makes the us unemployment rate of [4.9%]( https://www.google.com/#q=us+unemployment+rate) pretty good.

 So if anything the fed isn’t afraid of inflation the problem being is to raise inflation is the Federal Funds rate combine this with the current Funds Rate is targeted at a rate of 0.25%-0.50%. Which means the rate can’t go much lower. So the fed is doing all it can to meet inflation and employment targets, and do exactly what they want.

Of course you don’t actually want to raise inflation, the reason why raising inflation actually combats unemployment is that is devalues the labor they are selling. Now that labor is decreasing firms can purchase more labor to meet their demand; which I doubt these fine protestors are arguing for. Which from their rhetoric is the exact opposite of what they argue. Specially
>When the rich’s wages grow up they call it growth, when ours go up they call it inflation

…. Anyway

>The coalition said it wanted the Fed and Congress to consider changes in the makeup of the boards of directors of the 12 regional banks to promote more diversity among a group of officials that is mainly white and male and dominated by bankers.

White they have a strong argument for partly because I don’t have the ethnic breakdown of the board of directors, and about [81%]( http://www.motherjones.com/files/Financial_services_diversity_charts_Artboard%208_0.png) of the financial industry is white so it’s not too suspiring they would fail on being ethnically diverse. 

In terms of gender 2 of the 5 seats on the governor’s board are women. The Board of the directors is kind of bad with a rough 1-2 ration of women to men. And here finance is a little better with almost half of the labor but the leadership is close to the same. 

But the reason why they want minorities is not to make the industry more inclusive (which it really does need to be) but because they believe that it will change the decision making process to prioritize their views. PoC would have new views on the topic, but I’d assume they are the top of their field and actually understand it so the chance they follow the ideas they subscribe is foolish.

Here’s their website which deserves an R1 that I don’t have time [for](https://populardemocracy.org/campaign/building-national-campaign-strong-economy-fed)


Bonus they had their [reservation]( https://populardemocracy.org/news-and-publications/fed-group-claims-fed-behind-loss-reservation) for the economic symposium that was deleted by accident and they are now crying foul and that the Fed purposely deleted their reservation because we all know the Fed is a secret cabal out to get the little guy.

However, a number of small changes in the aggregate study design have to be made in order to make the conclusive inferences more tenable.

1. There is a lack of consideration of heterogeneity with respect to implicit product quality

While he astutely observes a lack of structure or 'type' to Carly Shay's attraction, he doesn't mention Gibson's lenma, more commonly known as Gibby.

Going by similar micro theory decision assumptions, we can assume that Carly wants to maximize her utility with a preference for current period consumption over future period consumption (we assume a stochastic discount factor for Carly's consumption preference).

Gibby is an objectively superior product to Freddie, but Carly still doesn't choose to enter a relationship with Gibby. This shows a level of agent bias and irrationality, which would skew our standard errors and cause heteroskedasticity when we run regressions on Carly's preference rule.

Carly also betrays [Hicksian utility maximization](https://imgur.com/6GNZbuI) assumptions when she chooses not to enter into a monogamous relationship with Gibby. Let's assume Carly maximizes her utility, (u) to the price, (pi) and quantity, (xi) of the good in question. While Gibby does have a higher price than Freddie (restricting Carly to purchase less quantities of Gibby due to her limited budget constraint), Gibby has more quantity in terms of body mass and quality of time spent (due to his status as a luxury good), therefore making Gibby the better choice.

While the fact that Carly did not end up choosing Gibby further proves that she is indeed not shallow, we still cannot allow for the absence of a statistically significant variable from our estimation. This discrepancy in information and lack of predictability for the agent presents an information problem making the resulting regression suffer from omitted variable bias. My proposition is to enter the Gibby effect as an IV or a control variable to compensate for the bias of Carly's behavior, as proposed by [Angrist and Krueger, 2001](https://economics.mit.edu/files/18). I also propose the use of a difference in difference model to properly asses the changes in Carly's attraction levels over time and to also deal with the heteroskedastic nature of Carly's bias.

2) The infinite horizon / bellman equation model may not sufficiently model for Carly's changes in choice

While the infinite horizon model does a good job to capture Carly's consumption preferences over time, we have to consider the several boyfriends she entered and exited into relationships with before and during the show. In other words, Carly exhibits changes in behavior, but the bellman equation does not formally model the probability of changes or switches in her regime choices.

To compensate for this, I propose the use of a Markov regime switching model in order to allow for changes in Carly's decision rule. The function of this model would be to accurately measure the episodic nature of Carly's attraction, and the fundamental changes in her behavior following a shift in the underlying parameters: That is, a structural change in the market microstructure in question.

Because [u/MambaMentaIity](https://www.reddit.com/user/MambaMentaIity/) uses a Markov process in his R1, for this model, let's assume the probability Carly switches regimes (boyfriends) can be modelled by Hamilton filtered ( smoothed ) probabilities under a Markov regime switching model. The model is maximized under log likelihood. Let st be denoted as the 'smoothed' probability that Carly changes boyfriends and let st - 1 be the probability of the change in the previous episode. As such, the probability of a regime [switch can be modelled like this.](https://imgur.com/lFfyZVE)

If you don't like the Hamilton filtered probabilities, perhaps you'd prefer Quandt (1972) for Markov switching. Let's assume that nature chooses between regimes (boyfriends) 1 and 2 with probabilities **λ** and 1 - **λ** , where X is unknown to the investigator. As such, the [conditional probability density of Yi looks like this](https://imgur.com/IiyY5wJ). Through this, we can assume that movements of the state variable between regimes are governed by a Markov process, with the property expressed as

P\[a < yt < b |y1,y2,....yt-1\] = P\[a < yt < b | yt-1)

allowing us to properly model for the probability of changes in regimes for Carly's relationships more formally.

While the criticism [u/MambaMentaIity](https://www.reddit.com/user/MambaMentaIity/) made of the iCarly fandom holds its water, there are a number of tweaks that needed to be added in order to complete the model and rid it of biased estimates and potential model misspecification. I propose the Gibby effect as an IV, and for the use of a difference in difference model in order to deal with the heteroskedasticity in Carly's behavior. I also propose the use of Markov regime switching in order to formally model for fundamental changes in Carly Shay's psyche.",31501,t2_a5etixxu,0.97,330,12

From /r/technology comes another thread filled to the brim with an incredibly nuanced and sensible discussion of communications policy.

>The idea of something called competition in providing Internet service is ridiculous. Even if all four of the major competitors were in the same area, they would simply make a gentleman's agreement on prices. 

There are two aspects that make price fixing (or collusion in general) much more difficult to maintain that are present in this situation:

1.) It is more difficult to resist cheating in a collusive agreement as the number of competitors go up. With each additional colluding firm, the collusive joint profits get divided even further. This makes the alternative of cheating - by dropping price to capture all or a large portion of total profits - more attractive to any single colluding firm thus making collusion less sustainable. 

2.) A collusive agreement can be enforced if all participants can easily monitor each other, but if pricing is difficult to monitor, then it is very easy to cheat. ISPs, especially national multimarket ones, typically operate on a pricing model that involves new customer deals, haggling, and some price discrimination. This means that, for example, two people from the same customer profile can pay different prices for Internet service depending on if one is a new customer or if one is willing to call up their ISP to haggle on price and service. It should also be mentioned that bundling of services (e.g. Phone + TV + Internet for $109.99/month) makes it difficult to impute the price paid for Internet service alone. While AT&T might be able to look at Comcast's website and see the distribution of pricing for advertised offers, it is pretty much impossible for them to see the distribution of pricing among what all of Comcast's customers *actually* pay.

>I'm sure they're all friends with one another, know each other's wives, drink blood together, praise Satan together, and so one.

It's not entirely clear whether this commenter believes that pricing policy for large multimarket ISPs is set by local managers rather than a centralized pricing department. Such a scheme among ISPs (localized pricing management) would likely be very inefficient compared to taking advantage of scale economies. The HQs of ISP giants like Comcast, Mediacom, Charter, AT&T, Centurylink, etc are all spread out across the nation, so people responsible for pricing policy in their respective companies likely never interact with people of other companies on a regular basis. [It's not like they're a bunch of local propane dealers sorting out a price fixing scheme at their neighborhood diner.](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/kingofthehill/images/4/4d/132037.jpg)

It could also be the case that a market is served by 3 or 4 local  companies run by managers who's wives all drink blood together every Saturday at the local farmer's market or something, but this type of market (all competitors local) is very rare among ISPs if it exists at all.

To extend a small olive branch of fairness, it is legitimate to question whether a market can be made more competitive by adding a 3rd or 4th competitor. This is an open question and is actually an area of research in my PhD. But if I can point to one piece of research (to satisfy the R1 guidelines! :p), [Xiao and Orazem (2011)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167718710001384) use a Bresnahan and Reiss framework to study how subsequent entrants into local ISP markets affect profits. They find that markets get significantly more competitive as 2nd and 3rd firms enter into the market, but by the 4th entrant, competitive conduct does not differ.

600,knxkvq,2020-12-31,badeconomics,Multiple instances of bad organisational economics,"The post is Rule 1 multiple claims, with a common theme. 

**Claim 1**: /u/isntanywhere says: [The firm does not have power of fiat. Does not have any ""authority, no disciplinary action any different in the slightest degree from ordinary market contracting between any two people"". He does this so by quoting Alchian Demstez's famous 1972 article on information costs](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/iyx0ra/what_does_power_of_fiat_mean/g6j88oc/).

**R1, Claim 1**: Since that paper was selected in AER's top 20 papers of all time I should begin atleast by quoting [Oliver Williamson 1994](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117852?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)

> The argument that the firm ""has no power of fiat, no authority, no disciplinary action any different in the slightest degree from ordinary market contracting"" (Armen Alchian and H. Demsetz, 1972 p. 777) **is exactly wrong**: firms can and do exercise fiat that markets cannot

Williamson chalks the presence of Fiat within Firms to i) Forbearance Laws ii) Informal Organization. Organization economics, since Alchian Demstez has inquired into firm-market dichotomy and have illustrated their *comparative viability*, I will illustrate a few:

- The firm through internalization is able to solve the Risk Incentive Trade off better

Principal agent models which incorporates risk in production, the total product(f) is a function of productivity parameter (ε) and action of the agent (e). Both e,ε are unobserved by the principal while being observable by the agent. The total product f(e,p) is observed by both. The agent has a cost function c(e) s.t. c'>=0 and c''<=0. Therefore dis utility(-c) is convex. The principals problem is to design a contract which induces agent to produce the first best level of effort subject to i) the incentive constraint ii) outside utility constraint.

The problem is, if the worker has constant absolute risk aversion >0 or has a limited liability constraint or generally risk averse, no first best contract is possible the principal faces a risk incentive trade off. For a formal model and proof see, [Prendergast page 12-13](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2564725?seq=7#metadata_info_tab_contents) [Bolton Dewatripont text page 131-133](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/Contract_Theory/H57uDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover)

Since the principal faces the task of insuring the agents, while the agent undertakes an hidden action, undertaking this transaction within the firm (as opposed to the market) allows for i) better monitoring (distortionless observation of signals) ii) better design of incentive mechanisms, which is impossible in the market. As [Williamson 1975](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1816983?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) has put it,

> The advantages of internalization reside in the facts that the firm's ex post access to the relevant data is superior, it attenuates the incentives to exploit uncertainty opportunistically, and the control machinery that the firm is able to activate is more selective....... (page 117)

> Internalization does not eliminate the need for input evaluation. Rather, the advantage of internalization, for input monitoring purposes, resides in the differential ease with which controls are exercised. An external agency, by design, lacks recourse to the internal control machinery: pro- posed remedies require the consent of the contractor and then are highly circumscribed; unrestricted access by the buyer to the contractor's internal control machinery (**including selective use of employment, promotion, remuneration, an internal resource allocation processes**) is apt to be denied. In consideration of the costs and limitations of input monitoring by outsiders, the buyer may choose instead to bear the risk and perform the work himself. The buyer thus internalizes, through backward vertical integration, a transaction which, but for uncertainty, would move through the market. A cost-type contract for internal procurement is arranged. (page 118)

- Firms solve the ""You get what you pay for"" problem better.

This section is based upon 3 papers [Baker 1992](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2138733?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents), [Holmstrom Milgrom 1991](https://www.jstor.org/stable/764957?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). They differ slightly in their models but the results, non optimality of high powered incentives ie piece rates is smae.

We assumed in the previous section that the total product is unique and observable by the principal and can be written into the contract. However the agent is asymmetrically informed over what actions will do the principal good. Or that the principal does not know his true objective function. Similarly it may happen that the principals objective function is multi task, there are objective measures for some tasks while none for others.

For example: when one visits the doctor to get health advice the do not know what their true objective function is, similarly the management supervising the  scientists in academia or industry do not know their objective function vast majority of jobs in a knowledge economy suffer this problem. A teacher teaching students have the responsibility to i) create competence and ii) developing thinking ability while i) is contractible through test scores or exams ii) is non contractible.

In this circumstances a first best contract is not possible even when the agent is risk neutral. [Following Baker 1992 the optimal rate of incentive (b*) is given by the equation 8 in figure.](https://i.imgur.com/4V7miLd.jpg) [2](https://i.imgur.com/lANKjmC.jpg) P(ε) is marginal product wrt action(e) on the contracted measure (P) and V(ε) is marginal product wrt to e principals objective function(V), given state of the world ε. b* is directly proportionate to the correlation between both. Thus as Baker puts it,

> Since P(ε) may not equal V(ε) in every state of the world, the contract based on P gives the agent inaccurate information about how hard to work, and the agent suffers a loss of utility from this effort variation. **The result is that the principal chooses to reduce the effort variation by reducing the piece rate, with an attendant cost in terms of incentives for effort.**

Therefore high powered, objective piece rates fail spectacularly. Markets where the product desired is objectively represented and have the highest risk incentive trade off (no insurance full incentives) fail spectacularly too. Only within the firm where various i) subjective measures of performance are available ii) cohort monitoring is available iii) carrier concerns are available iv) repeated interaction is forced to take place that such problems are solved.

- Incomplete Contracts and Specialized Assets 

However More fundamentally Alchian Demstez neglects i) the presence of specialized assets (physical or otherwise) wrt to a transaction ii) contractual incompleteness. Specialized assets wrt to a particular transaction, 1) moves the transaction away from competition to bilateral monopoly 2) generates appropriable quasi rents(AQRs). This coupled with contractual incompleteness means that i) distribution AQRs cannot be contracted away ex ante ii) ex post their will bargaining about such rents, which is itself costly. See [Williamson 1989 page 142-145](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1573448X8901006X) In such a situation ex post governance institutions which can decide through fiat the appropriation of quasi rents. This leads to an ""optimal"" allocation.

Hopefully it has become clear from the above discussion that u/isntanywhere and Alchain Demstez are **themselves Delusional**, Firms do have power of fiat, higher authority and disciplinary ability, they exercise this through:

- i) dulling and crafting incentives in a way fit for the job which a market cannot; thus being able to punish and reward behaviour appropriately (Williamson's ""internal control apparatus"")

- ii) is able to access and act on data (subjective performance evaluation) which cannot be contracted and verifiable in a court (Williamson's informal organisation and Forbearance laws respectively). 

Lastly u/isntanywhere tries to make a difference between ""leverage"" and ""fiat"", claiming firms have first not the later. However this is exactly wrong, people on whom formal authority is vested within firm make decisions which affect the outcomes of the agents (ie they have discretionary authority). Such decisions cannot (are not) challengeable in the courts, nor do courts have the appropriate data to do this (see point 2). In this sense firms do fiat (ie engage in private ordering)

**Claim 2:**  From some time ago, u/RobThrope says multiple things: i) [""Why though is it common that the workers in several manufacturing steps work for the same employer? As Coase pointed out, the answer is transaction costs....However, each purchase comes with a cost. Buying and selling aren't free. For example, **it's likely that the soles that are bought will have to be inspected before they're used.**](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/7obi0v/what_do_bosses_do/dscky9z/) 

**R1 Claim 2:**

u/RobThrope identifies ""inspection costs"" to be a form of transaction costs which shifts the transaction from market to firm. The mistake here is obvious, while inspection costs are transaction costs however they are not *discriminating transaction costs*. Just because you do not buy an object in a market but instead procure it internally, the need for inspection does not dis appear. The work of an employee is surveilled and inspected continuously. 

ii) [""I'm sceptical of the theory that hierarchy is inherent in division of labour.""......""There's no fundamental reason why hierarchy is needed here.""](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/7obi0v/what_do_bosses_do/dsc6wgl/)

Theres a reason why Oliver Williamsons famous book is titled: [Markets and **Hierarchies**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1496220) or why Rajan and Zingales writes papers titled [**Power** in the theory of a firm](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2586908?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) or why Aghion Triole write papers differentiating [Formal and Real Authority in firms](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2138869?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents), it is not a left wing conspiracy to economically understand power, authority and hierarchies.

Knowledge and information costs as previously discussed are endemic it turns (given situations) hierarchies, control and authority allow optimal transactions.

> ii) Some claim that capital is the reason.....Any type of physical capital could be rented out. So, why don't capital owners do that rather than employing people to work on the capital? The reason is often that the contracts that would have to drawn up would end up being impractically complex and extremely difficult or costly to enforce. Where capital can be easily rented out with fairly simple contracts, you'll see that actually being done.

While it is completely true that contracts of renting out capital is complex, contracts with respect to employment are complex too are also costly. Then what determines employing vs renting out? This has been explained by GHM,

Ownership of a physical asset confers residual rights of control, that is as far as the initial contract is incomplete (has missing provisions) this is filled up by the owner as the particular state of the world manifests. This allows the owner to appropriate entirely (or decide in the distribution of) Quasi Rents, which arise in relational contracting.",amour_propre_,t2_7rsngvx0,0.94,52,23

Having had a recent discussion about Utility Theory on this sub, let's use this as the example. As I understand it:

Utility Theory is a paradigm in economics. So the concept has broad implications in economists' understanding of economy behaviour. Such as the rejection of households having running cost. 

From an applied science perspective a pardigm is a theory that has broad implications on our understanding of the world around us. A theory is a hypothesis that has been independently verified by many researchers. A hypothesis is a proposition that make useful testable predictions about why the world is the way it is. This means that if a prediction of a hypothesis or theory fails, this error provides useful information about the weakness of the hypothesis or theory.

If we consider Utility Theory it doesn’t make useful testable predictions. According to Samuelson and Nordhaus 2010, ""you should resist the idea that utility is a psychological function or feeling that can be measured or observed"". This is saying that utility is an abstract process. However, if it is an abstract process, how do we know it exists if we can't prove its existance through testable predictions?

Some economists believe they have proof of utility theory, through their work on utility functions. As Utility Theory does not make direct testable predictions, then the goal post of the defence of utility theory shifts. So the question is, is the argument for utility functions an argument for the paradigm (justifying the rejection of household running costs) or is simply showing that the choices of consumers under some circumstances can be ""seen"" to affect price.

Here we have to note that utility function are effectively a surrogate model (as I understand them). The means that they are an equation with unknow parameters, and the parameters can be found by fitting the equation to empirical data. In applied science (and economics) surrogate models are very useful tools but they are not proof of a hypothesis. This is the same as a statistical correlation provinding evidence of a fit with data, but not providing proof through independently verified useful testable predictions. 

So currently the philosophical apprach to knowledge in economics is not consistent with that of applied sciences. Evidence supporting this argument is that economics has schools of thought, whereas applied sciences do not. Psychology is the exception, although the different schools of thought are different approaches to therapy treatments and are not mutually exclusive.

I argue that if we demote Utility Theory from a paradigm and accept that households have running costs then it is possible to make testable predictions about economy behaviour. If you're interested in an approach to economics that follows scientific methodology, uses the mathematics of dynamical systems (used by many applied science subject such as meteorology)  and surrogate models of population behaviour the please go to my ResearchGate.net project ""Economy Dynamics"" https://www.researchgate.net/project/Economy-Dynamics",the1stEconomist,t2_kv97qrjq,0.47,0,73
602,ilzd0v,2020-09-03,badeconomics,Value doesnt[sic] have anything to do with pricing,"/u/alonjar asserts
>Value doesnt have anything to do with pricing though. Pricing is always cost +. If the schools costs havent changed (which they mostly havent, as you said they're still paying for the same buildings/loan installments etc) then they certainly arent going to adjust their pricing.

Value absolutely has everything to do with pricing. In economic terms, we have cost, price, and surplus. Cost is what it takes to produce the unit, price is what a consumer is willing to pay (even monopolies are constrained by demand), and surplus is the additional value generated by either selling at a higher price than willing to take (producer surplus) or buying at a lower price than willing to pay (consumer surplus).

Your run of the mill Econ 101 text book will show something like [this]( https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/consumer-surplus-1.png). Your run of the mill MBA corporate strategy text book will show something like [this]( https://imgur.com/9iWPS22).

If a business knows a consumer is willing to pay more, they will try to capture that additional revenue. We call that price discrimination and [it is especially prevalent in higher education.]( https://www.nber.org/papers/w23360#:~:text=We%20find%20substantial%20price%20discrimination%20within%20colleges.&text=A%20one%20standard%20deviation%20increase,range%20between%20%24110%20and%20%245%2C750.) So, value has everything to do with higher education pricing and while the [college wage premium is an excellent ROI]( https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/lkatz/files/the_race_between_education_and_technology_the_evolution_of_u.s._educational_wage_differentials_1890_to_2005_1.pdf), it may be [flattening]( https://www.nber.org/papers/w22935) and if the perceived value of a college degree decreases below the price offered by an institution, no trade will take place.

>In many ways the schools now have extra costs above and beyond what is normal, as they're paying for all the old stuff in addition to new software licensing and online learning infrastructure.

This is not the consumers’ problem *unless they value the education at least at the price offered*. Total cost = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs. VC has arguably stayed the same with increases offset by decreases elsewhere. I tried to find a public university system budget open to the public for free but was met with various fees I am not going to pay so this is just an assumption on my part. Fixed costs are probably the same as pre-COVID19 given they are fixed. Either way, the cost is not the consumers’ problem, especially in a competitive market. Which begs the question “is higher ed a competitive market?”

The answer is [maybe](https://core.ac.uk/reader/6606080) depending on how you define the market. Harvard is not North Idaho College no matter how many times my boss says so. [Online programs](https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f88388.pdf) also introduced competitiveness to higher education, but did not have a substantial effect on selective institutions like Harvard. So while the evidence suggests an online Harvard education is not the same as an online Georgia State education, consumers are decidedly changing their preferences. And every run of the mill MBA corporate strategy textbook will tell you consumer preferences and perceptions are all that matter. 

>But yes, the cost of schooling is vastly inflated above what is minimally required in general, IMHO.

I tend to agree but classroom discussion, especially for liberal arts majors, is important. At least it was for me and those classrooms were expensive (note: if you plan on donating to a higher ed institution, I highly recommend you donate to the operating budget. Everyone wants their name on a building but no one wants to pay to keep the lights on). This is more difficult to utilize or control in a video conference setting. We may be in the midst of a major disruption to the current higher education model.

>Imagine a fallacious investor who, instead of investing 50% of his portfolio into stocks, and the other half — into “safe” bonds, as financial analysts suggest him, decides to undertake risks and puts 90% of his money into the stock market (let’s assume that he is a Republican with strong faith in Trump and the future of the US economy under his rule).

>When this occurs with many players, the market will experience significant distortions, with some assets being over/undervalued.

1. Portfolio allocation depends on preferences, which are inherently dynamic.
2. How would putting 90% of an agent's money in the stock market cause any distortions in the market. If we assume that the individual is a small investor, then they would be a price taker, so it would be unlikely for this individual to have any pricing power.
3. The assumption that the individual is a republican is redundant: it doesn't add to any of the analysis
4. Let's suppose that all that has been said is factually correct. How is AI supposed to solve this? That's not clear.

>In the USA, for instance, Republicans and Democrats, though seeing the same set of economic facts, perceive them differently: depending on who is in power, their views will range from pessimistic to optimistic. Of course, their misguided beliefs will lead to flawed investment decisions, hence altering the actual state of affairs by virtue of the change in asset prices.

This chain of reasoning makes absolutely no sense. How will flawed investment decisions change asset prices?  Prices of which assets? I don't understand how aggregate supply or demand is changing.

If the author was trying to make a joke, then take a bow my dawg. If by true science you mean the natural sciences, then mathematics doesn't fall under this umbrella, since maths is a formal science. If you mean to say that social scientists don't conduct experiments like physicists and chemists, then sure, economics is not a 'true science'. However that is precisely why economists try to use 'natural experiments' and some economists do conduct lab experiments (like in experimental economics), and that is because it simply is not possible to run the gold standard randomised control trial, as is done in medicine.

Since economists are heavily critiqued on the assumptions they make in their models, I would just like to point out that even physicists make idealisations. In deriving the ideal gas law, physicists talk about volumeless point particles, which they know do not exist. The interesting question is what to make of it. Of course there is no ideal gas, but that is not to say the model is not useful. In fact, it is used when dealing with nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen as a good approximation to true behaviour. No financial economist would tell you that stock prices actually follow brownian motion. Nevertheless it is a good starting point.

I think Francis Diebold does a good job of explaining the difference between econometrics and machine learning, he says:

""Machine learning (ML) is almost always centered on prediction; think ""ŷ"".   Econometrics (E) is often, but not always, centered on prediction.  Instead it's also often interested on estimation and associated inference; think ""β̂"".

Or so the story usually goes. But that misses the real distinction. *Both* ML and E as described above are centered on prediction.  The key difference is that ML focuses on non-causal prediction (if a new person ii arrives with covariates Xi, what is my minimium-MSE guess of her y\_i?), whereas the part of econometrics highlighted above focuses on causal prediction (if I intervene and give person *i* a certain treatment, what is my minimum-MSE guess of Δy\_i?).  It just happens that, assuming linearity, a ""minimum-MSE guess of Δy\_i"" is the same as a ""minimum-MSE estimate of β\_i"".

So there is a ML vs. E distinction here, but it's not ""prediction vs. estimation"" -- *it's all prediction*.  Instead, the issue is non-causal prediction vs. causal prediction. ""

However, little attention, if any, is paid to the economic impacts of unauthorized immigrants (UIs). IIRC, the National Academy of Sciences report doesn’t mention them. [Chassamboulli and Peri (2015)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094202515000514) claim there are, to date, only 2 papers which attempt to estimate the economic impacts of UI--excluding their own, so there are now 3. All are simulations. We have no direct evidence of what happens when the UI population shrinks, by force or otherwise. 

Why care? When the NAS report was posted to /r/economics awhile back by yours truly, quite a few users claimed that UIs have a different impact than authorized immigrants (AIs). They couldn’t substantiate these claims because of the aforementioned lack of evidence, but their concerns could be valid. Perhaps UIs and AIs differ by some unobserved factors. If so, assuming the labor market impacts of AIs is the same for UIs would be invalid. Further research is needed to determine whether UIs and AIs have different economic impacts.

So what would happen if the UI population in the US suddenly shrunk, let’s say via a new border wall and mass deportation? Assume the Wall can be built and would work exactly as imagined. Thus, wall + deportation would lead to a significant shrinkage of the labor force. The wall alone would cut UI inflows (we assume). Deportation would increase outflows. Since inflows have equaled outflows since 2009, we can safely assume net shrinkage of the UI population, and hence the labor force, especially the low skilled labor force since the following are [true](http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2016/09/31170303/PH_2016.09.20_Unauthorized_FINAL.pdf):

1. Mexican UIs comprise 52% of the estimated 11 million UIs currently in the US;
2. Mexican UIs are more likely to be low skilled than other UIs and natives.

Let’s start with theory. Immigration shifts both labor supply and labor demand to the right, and the overall effect on wages is ambiguous (see immigration FAQ). Ignoring labor demand shifts caused by immigration and simply concluding that immigration can only cause wage depression is called the Lump of Labor Fallacy. 

Now consider what would happen if immigrants suddenly had to leave the US labor market. Labor supply shifts left, and if only this shift occurred then wages would rise. **Supporters of the border wall and mass deportation assume only labor supply will shift left, but this is also the Lump of Labor Fallacy!** If a sizable chunk of the US labor force is forced to leave the market, 2 things will happen:

1. Goods and services markets will lose a sizable chunk of consumers;
2. Even before the shrink, employers could *expect* higher labor costs due to a future labor force shrink, and these expectations about future events would affect their hiring decisions today.

Both factors cause labor demand to shift left. Now the question of whether Wall + deportation net increases wages is an empirical one; we can’t answer it a priori. 

Back to the evidence, we don’t have it. DSGE simulations predict positive welfare effects of UI inflows on natives, even after relaxing the assumption of perfect competition.  [Chassamboulli and Peri (2015)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094202515000514) is the only simulation of the effects of *reducing* the UI population. Their model is much more sophisticated than mine and gives other channels through which UI can affect native welfare. From the abstract:

>As immigrants – especially illegal ones – have a worse outside option than natives, their wages are lower. Hence, their presence reduces the labor cost of employers who, as a consequence, create more jobs per unemployed when there are more immigrants. Because of such effects our model shows increasing deportation rates and tightening border control weakens low-skilled labor markets, increasing unemployment of native low-skilled workers. Legalization, instead, decreases the unemployment rate of low-skilled natives and increases income per native.

*****

**tl;dr + RI:** Supporters of a border wall and deportation often commit the Lump of Labor Fallacy in reverse, by assuming such policies couldn’t decrease labor demand. No direct evidence exists which could suggest the effect of reducing the unauthorized immigrant population. Simulations suggest negative welfare effects on natives, contrary to popular belief.

So a few years ago, Reason made [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w1DeNrZYLE) about five common arguments against immigration and why they are wrong. Unsurprisingly, the video did not have a great reception.

About seven months later, a conservative Youtuber by the name of ""Don't Walk, Run! Productions"" posted [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_b9nC3Sxo) that attempted to debunk Reason's debunking. I will now be debunking this video, so I'm essentially doing an R1 of an R1 of an R1.

————————————————————————————————————————————————

**Reason's argument #1:** Immigrants are not stealing jobs, in contrary to what Trump says. They also allow for more job creation due to employers having more money to spend on productive use.

**DWDR's counter:** Trump was talking about illegal immigrants, and these immigrants make up a substantial portion of the workforce in sectors like agriculture and construction. Illegal immigrants lower wages substantially without lowering prices that much, so they are merely being exploited without doing much for the American economy. And they wouldn't create jobs as Reason argues because they would just spend the money on more illegal immigrants.

**My counter:**

>Trump was talking about illegal immigrants

Not that relevant tbh in terms of labor market impact, I don't know why so many nativists make this point.

>immigrants make up a substantial portion of the workforce in sectors like agriculture and construction.

Irrelevant unless you adhere to the lump of labour fallacy and believe that there is a [fixed number of jobs](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) that can't be influenced by immigrants, which isn't true. Immigrants can create jobs through [higher consumer spending](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927537108000316), for example. For certain workers like [high school dropouts](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration), low-skilled immigration does cause lower labor market outcomes, but you shouldn't expect lower overall wages in the long run.

>Illegal immigrants lower wages substantially without lowering prices that much, so they are merely being exploited without doing much for the American economy.

First of all, if DWDR is so concerned with the low wages and exploitation of illegal immigrants, then he should support the [legalization](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/339616) of such immigrants. Sending illegal immigrants back to their origin countries would not help them at all, considering that they literally left those countries to seek better wages.

For his take on prices, it is true that the price impact of illegal immigration has been [overstated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_illegal_immigrants_in_the_United_States#Price_levels), so he does make somewhat of a fair point.

But he also implies that the lack of illegal immigrants would raise wages and employment among remaining workers, using [an article from the Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/low-paid-illegal-work-force-has-little-impact-on-prices/) as a source indirectly. But we have a real-world example of this theory being tested—an [article from the AER](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/aer.20170765) found that immigration restrictions which shrank the Bracero program in the agricultural sector merely led to greater mechanization instead of higher labor market outcomes for native workers. Yes, these were not necessarily illegal immigrants, but there is no reason why mechanization would not occur in such a scenario.

>And they wouldn't create jobs as Reason argues because they would just spend the money on more illegal immigrants.

Not a great argument on Reason's part, but there are additional reasons why more immigration doesn't necessarily lead to lower overall native outcomes, such as a [higher return on](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2017/how-immigration-affects-workers-two-wrong-models-right-one) [capital investment](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jkennan/research/OpenBorders.pdf) and [task specialization](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.1.3.135). Note that these apply in the long run only.

————————————————————————————————————————————————

**Reason's argument #2**: Most legal immigrants and all illegal immigrants are not allowed to receive most forms of welfare. They really only benefit from emergency medical services, as well as K-12 education. Non-citizens use welfare at lower rates than native citizens. They also have a higher labor market participation rate.

**DWDR's counter:** 51% of legal and illegal immigrants use at least one welfare program. EMS for illegal immigrants costs $2 billion. As for K-12, there are 65,000 undocumented high school graduates, and since $13,119 are spent per public school student, this leads to around $11.1 billion being spent on undocumented students. And once you account for their children born in the United States, the total cost is actually $66.7 billion. Illegal non-citizens shouldn't be using welfare at all, and illegal immigrants are stealing your jobs because of their higher labor market participation rate.

**My counter:**

>51% of legal and illegal immigrants use at least one welfare program.

This statistic does not contradict Reason's point, as they did not say that immigrants do not use welfare at all.

>EMS for illegal immigrants costs $2 billion.

Technically not bad economics, as it depends on whether or not you believe illegal immigrants should have access to EMS or other basic services, but barring immigrants from such services would probably limit integration/assimilation.

>As for K-12, there are 65,000 undocumented high school graduates, and since $13,119 are spent per public school student, this leads to around $11.1 billion being spent on undocumented students.

I mean, assuming you want undocumented immigrants to integrate into American society properly, barring them from public education would be the last thing you would want to do. Also, [the U.S Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyler_v._Doe#Summary) ruled that these immigrants have the right to a K-12 public education.

The numbers themselves are also poorly used, as illegal immigrants probably receive less than the average student due to their [poorer socioeconomic background](https://econofact.org/what-explains-the-wages-of-undocumented-workers). And he fails to mention the future benefits from [greater human capital](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20180352).

>And once you account for their children born in the United States, the total cost is actually $66.7 billion.

Again, technically not bad economics, but they are citizens, so they shouldn't be treated any differently just for being the children of illegal immigrants.

>Non-citizens shouldn't be using welfare at all

Not really, they can [still use](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/edb17.pdf) certain welfare programs under certain conditions.

>illegal immigrants are stealing your jobs because of their higher labor market participation rate.

Again with the lump of labour fallacy.

————————————————————————————————————————————————

**Reason's argument #3**: Illegal immigrants pay $11.7 billion in state/local taxes, with $1.1 billion coming from income taxes.

**DWDR's counter:** Only 4.4 million illegal immigrants file income taxes, meaning that each of those illegal immigrants pays a measly $250 of income tax on average.

**My counter:** I find it weird that DWDR only includes income tax in his calculation, but regardless it is true that illegal immigrants themselves do not contribute that much in fiscal revenue to state/local governments. However, future generations actually have a [net fiscal impact](https://www.nap.edu/read/23550/chapter/14#541) on state/local budgets.

————————————————————————————————————————————————

**Reason's argument #4**: It's stupid to suggest that illegal immigrants should just wait in line, considering that very few visas were actually given to a very large waiting list. Uses Mexico as an example (65,000 visas given to 1.4 million Mexicans on the waitlist). And on average, people have to wait 15-25 years to enter the United States.

**DWDR's counter:** It's dumb to focus on Mexico, we should focus on all countries. In 2016, 4.56 million people wanted to immigrate to the United States, and 618,078 people arrived, meaning that 13% of people on the list get in. Also, getting into the United States should not be quick because being in America should be a privilege.

**My counter:**

>It's dumb to focus on Mexico, we should focus on all countries. In 2016, 4.56 million people wanted to immigrate to the United States, and 618,078 people arrived, meaning that 13% of people on the list get in.

How long the waiting process is depends on the type of immigrant.

>Also, getting into the United States should not be quick because being in America should be a privilege.

By acknowledging that the immigration process does take a long time, he kind of contradicts his previous point. But anyways, this is a moral/normative take, so I can't really R1 it.

**Reason's argument #5**: Hispanic immigrants are learning English at higher rates than previous immigration waves.

**DWDR's counter:** Mentions that the background footage is of Lauren Southern, who is arguing against immigration into Canada, meaning that it is not relevant. Argues that immigrants are not integrating because only 25% of Hispanic adults speak only English, citing a Pew Research Center report.

**My counter:**

>Mentions that the background footage is of Lauren Southern, who is arguing against immigration into Canada, meaning that it is not relevant.

Nick Gillespie and Reason's arguments do not apply to just America...

>Argues that immigrants are not integrating because only 25% of Hispanic adults speak mainly English, citing a Pew Research Center report.

First of all, an immigrant mainly speaking a certain language doesn't necessarily mean that they are unable to speak other languages.

Also, Nick Gillespie said that Hispanic immigrants were *learning* English at faster rates than previous immigrants. He did not say anything about their *current* knowledge of English. In fact, the Pew Research Center report DWDR literally shows that future generations of Hispanic immigrants begin to use more English, which is in line with other empirical evidence such as [a report from the National Academies](https://www.nap.edu/read/21746/chapter/9#332).

>*Although language diversity among immigrants has increased even as Spanish has become the dominant immigrant language, the available evidence indicates that today’s immigrants are learning English at the same rate or faster than earlier immigrant waves.*

Oh and the most outrageous thing is that the consumer is the one driving the economy. Everyone can do that, producing is the hard part. You can't consume without producing first.

>While higher prices make it more challenging for Americans to afford everyday essentials, inflation isn’t always necessarily bad. In some cases, inflation can be a good thing for the economy.

You can't consume if you don't have the money and you can't have the money to consume if whatever money you have loses value by 2%. People are poor because they don't have things and you can't have things if you don't produce them and you can't produce more if your COSTS are going up due to inflation. Inflation can be a good thing, feels like saying that ""I am happy that instead of being able to buy two hamburgers, I am very happy I can buy only one"". Is this for real what I am reading for?

How can we say that the economy is strong when we have a whole of 32 trillion? How is a business or a personal budget strong when the equity is minus 32 trillion and counting?

>Inflation is the word that economists use to describe the gradual rise in prices throughout an economy.

No, it isn't. Prices can go up and down. A price can be zero and for something to be zero, you need a baseline. Compared with what is zero? compared with the baseline which is the supply of money in all of its shapes which during our times is the credit. You can't say that a price is 32 if you don't have the means of exchange which is the supply of money.

Is like saying that a balloon can grow bigger without air going inside it. That air is the supply of money. You may have various points on the balloon walls where the pressure is slightly different or maybe rising than other points (due to external exposure to temperature) but that is normal as nothing is uniform in nature, but having a general rise in pressure in the balloon is abnormal and indicates that the quantity of air has increased.

We can very well have the price of oil rising but if the quantity of money doesn't, then other prices will readjust because more money goes on oil. Yes, the oil price increase will increase as a share in the total cost of a product but the other cost that forms the price of that product will go down and compensate.

We can't have everyone eating an extra apple (CPI went up) if the total amount of apples didn't increase in number. Is like saying that I had eaten two fish but I caught only one.

CPI or GDP are bad metrics.

>While inflation may decrease the purchasing power of your dollars over time, economists generally believe that a low, steady level of inflation is necessary to drive economic growth.

No, it isn't, how can I reach higher (grow) if you add with each step some more weight on my back?

>When an economy experiences deflation, the prices of goods and services fall and the value of money grows. As a result, consumers can purchase more items and services with the same amount of money as before  
>  
>Sounds great, right? The trouble is that some negative repercussions come with deflation.

As with inflation, it makes the confusion and ties deflation to falling prices now when in fact deflation as the word deflate means ""***let air or gas out of (a tire, balloon, or similar object)***; How can you deflate something (a price/tire/balloon) if there wasn't the air inside it in the first place?. You can't!

Not that only sound, but it is great. What is bad with people being able to afford and buy more things? If we wouldn't be able to do that, I would write this on a typewriter and not even sure about that. There are no repercussions.

I see ""economists"" all around saying that prices have to rise otherwise famine will be around. How can you tell me that I should be happy and that is good that my costs are going up? How can I sell more and to many more people when my prices go up year after year?

How can I be more productive or how can I offer lower prices when my costs are rising? Gosh, I feel that the more someone is studying the more ... they become at understanding the basics.

>Deflation signals falling demand for goods and services and increasing supply, which drives prices lower. This may indicate that consumers are pessimistic about the economy, spending less money, and holding on to their cash.

Not deflation but the fact that people can't afford to buy something signals that there is falling demand. Like, we people have infinite demand, what we lack is the products and a price that is not too high for us to afford it.

People don't hold on to their cash, they just increase their **savings so they can buy later when they have saved enough to afford.**

>Over time, deflation undercuts the production of goods and services, leading to layoffs and increasing unemployment. Some ~~economists~~ think that deflation is even more dangerous than inflation.

Nonsense, prices going lower makes it so that more people will be able to buy so everything balances out as production only increases as firms can sell more.

>Can inflation be a good thing? Surprisingly, yes. Some level of inflation is crucial for the economy.  
>  
>While high inflation can be harmful, too little inflation can also weaken the economy.

So you tell me that if I can't afford one hamburger then I should buy two of them? Or if I afford 1,2 hamburgers, now I should be able to afford only 1 because ""that's how an economy grows""?

>When the economy is struggling and inflation is too low, the Fed will take the opposite approach by lowering interest rates or buying assets to increase cash circulation. The goal is to make it easier for people to borrow money ""by **increasing the supply of currency**"" and spur economic activity.

So the solution when you struggle to carry 10kg is to borrow 5 more from someone else? Economic activity is production, not consumption. Productive activity no matter how bad the liquidity is will always be in front of the consumer credit as consumption isn't adding to the basket.

I hear that people don't buy due to ""low consumer confidence"" so to instill confidence... let's push prices higher. How stupid is that! People don't buy it because they don't have the money and when they get it... inflation destroys their value. If I need a pair of shoes, I go and buy them but if I don't have the money because the price is too high, I can wish it to the moon and back and I still won't get the pair of shoes.

For me and my business, I try all the time to reduce costs so I can offer my customers a lower price. No business makes their profit from higher prices but from their margin and their revenue from volume. Volume increases when people have more purchasing power to buy my stuff.

Many think that companies will be obliterated if prices go down. I wish prices will go down because my costs will go down first. Until I produce I have to finance all those costs which will be lower which in turn is easier to finance which later offers me the possibility to sell it at a lower price and gain volume.

I need prices to go down so people can buy more.

>When inflation reduces the purchasing power of money, people pay more for housing, and that means inflation increases the value of property.

Now when it comes to who benefits, no you don't benefit in real terms. Yes, your house, and land increase in paper value but if you sell, collect all that paper and go to buy a SIMILAR one... you get exactly the same amount & quality of a product/property as the one before.

What happens, in reality, is that people sell and either downgrade and buy something cheaper on paper but get either a not-so-nice area or smaller house/plot or upgrade and put that paper as a down payment on a more expensive property.  In the end, the one who wins is the lenders who take their part as the nominal amounts are bigger or the government as their share in taxes increases.

Who doesn't want prices to go down? Those businesses levered up until their neck to subdue their competition. and the government doesn't want its tax receipts to decrease.

Another classic bad economics argument is ""but, people want higher salaries"". Of course, they want it when whatever money they get, devalues until the next working day. I would want the same. As a business owner, I interact with my colleagues daily and many would gladly take a low salary raise if their purchasing power won't disappear annually.

If a business is so scared that their prices would have to go 0.5% lower yearly and their employee's cost might be 0.5% higher or 1% that's because they are having a business model with minuscule margins which in the end may show that society is better off with them going bankrupt and resources redistributed to those who can maintain a healthy margin.

Another thing I see is... ""but people's salaries will have to go lower"". No, they won't. First, my employees would gain purchasing power and second they would get raises because they are more productive so it isn't like someone would start with a $40,000 salary, and by the time they retire, their income would be still $40,000. Absolute nonsense, people get replaced in a company, and every organization has a pay structure based on skills which on average increase with age.

As people get more experience and older, they earn more and as they retire and advance someone who's younger will advance as well with their income increasing. The basket of labor costs remains the same or decreases in line over the long term with the prices but that doesn't mean that ALL SALARIES remain the same or they will be cut. Nonsense.

I feel I live in an alternate reality.

Going back to inflation. We need it now because of the debt-based lifestyle we live. We got to the point in which we distort rational economics to fit and excuse the debt we incurred. The reasoning of why we actually need more of it which is outrageous.",Hot-Ad1448,t2_91okl4ag,0.3,0,282
610,15raw2e,2023-08-15,badeconomics,"The ""Cost of Thriving Index"" is nonsense","The [Cost of Thriving Index](https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/COTI_2023_Final.pdf) (COTI) is an index put out by American Compass (and originally by the Manhattan Institute) that purports to measure

>the number of weeks a typical worker would need to work in a given year to earn enough income to cover the major costs for a family of four in the American middle class in that year: Food, Housing, Health Care, Transportation, and Higher Education.

With the index finding:

>In 1985, COTI was 39.7. Costs totaled $17,586, while median weekly income for a man aged 25 or older working full-time was $443 ($23,036 per year).  
>  
>In 2022, COTI was 62.1. Costs totaled $75,732, while median weekly income for a man aged 25 or older working full-time was $1,219 ($63,388 per year).

Most people's immediate takeaway, certainly helped by quotes from American Compass like:

>COTI’s historical data depict the catastrophic erosion of middle-class life in America.

is that the quality of life in America has declined substantially since the 1980s for the middle-class. Is this correct? Well, no, otherwise I wouldn't be writing an R1, but let's continue.

Immediate problems: the percent of your income spent on stuff has to add up to 100%, but their categories aren't an exhaustive list of stuff. It purports to be an index of ""needs"", although this is debatable as ""needs"" like utilities, clothing, and technology are left out. Coincidentally, there has been [far less inflation](https://imgur.com/9jqo1Mg) in these categories.

The cherry picking has other problems. If you tell me that someone makes more money and spent more on certain goods and services, you might just be describing normal goods. If over time, consumers, as a fraction of their income, spend less on clothing and more on healthcare, that's a sign they're \*better off\*. 

But let's ignore all that and focus instead on their methodology. From their article:

>Economists rely on inflation-based adjustments to compare costs of living over time, but this method measures the cost of buying the same set of things in different eras. Perhaps a family could more easily afford a 1985 quality of life in 2015 than in 1985, but being in the middle class in 2015 means affording a 2015 quality of life.

A brief technical note, that's **not** what inflation-based adjustments try to do. What COTI thinks they do is **hold fixed a basket of goods**, but really it's trying to **hold fixed utility and adjust the basket**, which is why we change the weights on what people spend over time and the contents of the basket.

Anyways, there's a normative claim in here that I mostly agree with: it's fine to have a relative standard of living because we should expect to progress as a society. People, including myself, have made a similar argument for why relative poverty thresholds are useful -- almost no one is poor by a 1930's American standard of living, but given how much economic growth we've had since then I think it's fine to move the threshold for poverty up over time.

I would never say that we're worse off than we were 40 years ago, but if you want to make the argument that we could be doing better given the amount of growth we've had, by all means make that argument.

Unfortunately, they do a lot of rhetorical tricks throughout their brief that conflate ""we should have increasing expectations for prosperity"" and ""workers today are worse off than they were"". Saying things like:

>COTI’s historical data depict the catastrophic erosion of middle-class life in America.

and

>...It is indisputable that the set used in COTI is one that a middle-class family could afford a generation ago on one income and cannot afford any longer

By their own admission, this isn't true. 

>When inflation-adjusted figures report that a 2022 earner could afford roughly what a 1985 earner could, that assumes the 2022 earner still plans to drive a 1985 car, live in a 1985 house, watch a 1985 television, and receive 1985 medical care. 

A 2023 family could buy a 1985 consumption bundle and have plenty of room to spare; that we should aim or standards higher is an argument that we *could* be doing better not that we *are* doing worse. 

Normative claims aside, let's get to what we're all here for: pointing and laughing at their methodology. Category by category:

>**Food:** COTI uses the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s “Official Food Plans,” taking the average of its “Low-Cost” plan (which USDA defines as falling within the second quartile of food expenditures) and “Moderate-Cost” plan (third quartile) as an estimate of the median cost of a nutritious diet for a family of four, a standard that it updates over time. In 1985, this cost was $4,550. In 2022, this cost was $13,667.

and

>**Transportation:** COTI uses the U.S. Department of Transportation’s estimate (derived from the American Automobile Association) for total cost of ownership for a vehicle driven 15,000 miles per year. In 1985, this cost was $3,484. In 2022, this cost was $10,729.

Food and transportation I'm lumping together because they have the same obvious issue: no quality adjustments. A 1985 car was a piece of junk compared to what you can buy today so it makes sense that a current one costs more (in nominal dollars). Even today you can buy like a 2008 Corolla for less than what a 1985 Chevy Cavalier originally retailed for, and the Corolla will wipe the floor with the Chevy in every way.

This goes back to the difference between ""Almost 40 years later we *should* have better cars"" (sure, fine) and ""we are doing worse than we were earlier"" (no, very bad).

There's also a funny note that the American Enterprise Institute ([AEI) points out](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/the-cost-of-thriving-has-fallen-correcting-and-rejecting-the-american-compass-cost-of-thriving-index/), which is that the Department of Ag. updates the food index using the CPI, which is the exact thing COTI purports to hate!

&#x200B;

>**Housing:** COTI uses the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s “Fair Market Rent” (estimated at a local market’s 40th percentile as of 1995 and at the 45th percentile in earlier years) for a three-bedroom unit in the Raleigh, North Carolina MSA, where rents approximate the national median. In 1985, this cost was $5,560. In 2022, this cost was $18,204.

As three bedroom rentals in Raleigh go, so does the nation. Why they did this I have no idea. it's also unclear if Raleigh being representative means Raleigh is representative *now* or if it was representative *40 years ago* or both. Regardless, this is an insane amount of faith to put into one segment (three bedroom units) of one housing market (Raleigh) to be representative for 40 years. This index also has the same quality adjustments that plague the other ones, specifically for Raleigh since a larger share of the housing inventory is new and newer housing is higher quality and because Raleigh-Durham was a much rougher place in the 1980s.

&#x200B;

>**Health Care:** COTI uses the Kaiser Family Foundation’s estimate of the average premium for a family health insurance plan offered through a large employer. In 1985, this cost was $2,152. In 2022, this cost was $22,463. Note that data for imputing historical costs are available only from 1987 and the 2020 COTI therefore used the 1987 value in both 1985 and 1986, implying no cost growth in those years and thus overestimating the 1985 cost. The 2023 COTI estimates the 1985 cost as the midpoint between the 1987 cost and an estimate derived by extending backward from 1987 the average 1987–90 growth rate.

&#x200B;

This one is just flagrantly wrong. Those numbers come from counting both the employee and employer costs and subtracting those from income -- but this is double counting! The employee doesn't pay the employer's cost except through a reduction in wages, which is already accounted for by using nominal wage data. From the [AEI](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/the-cost-of-thriving-has-fallen-correcting-and-rejecting-the-american-compass-cost-of-thriving-index/) article doing the same debunking as me:

&#x200B;

>Take the 2022 data as an example. The baseline COTI calculation includes $22,463 for health insurance, which is subtracted from the family’s income of $63,388. However, Cass’s source data show that employees paid only 29 percent of the premium, or $6,514. In terms of the COTI “weeks of work” calculation, correcting these data reduces the number of weeks from 18.4 to 5.3. This 13-week reduction is over half the total decline between 1985 and 2022. (The full decline is 22.4 weeks.)

&#x200B;

So before we do anything regarding the fact that US healthcare is a million times better than what it was in 1985, the index is overstating healthcare costs by like 250%. Technically, this overstatement applies equally to 1985 as it does to 2023, so it shouldn't affect relative changes too much, but it's clearly very wrong. There's also the issue that this is **mean costs** compared to **median wages**. 

&#x200B;

>**Education:** COTI uses the U.S. Department of Education’s estimate for the total in-state cost (tuition, fees, room, and board) of attending a public, four-year college. This total is divided by two to estimate an annual amount that a family would need to save over eight years to put one child through college and thus over 16 years to put two children through college. In 1985, this cost was $1,841. In 2022, this cost was $10,669. (Note that the Department of Education has not yet released 2022 data, so 2021 data are used for 2022.)

This one is wrong because it uses *sticker price* and not what families actually pay; a lot of the increase in tuition is price discrimination against wealthier households. It's also again doing **median wages** vs **mean costs** and ignoring that most people don't send their kids to college -- even less so in 1985.

&#x200B;

>**Income:** COTI uses data from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Current Population Survey (CPS), which reports median full-time weekly earnings for men over the age of 25. In 1985, this wage was $443. In 2022, this wage was $1,219. **Authors Note: they do this same definition but with other groups, e.g. women, high school grads, etc.**

This should be after taxes to account for the fact that average [federal tax rates have gone down](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/historical-average-federal-tax-rates-all-households) for basically every part of the income distribution. Per [AEI](https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Cost-of-Thriving-Has-Fallen.pdf?x91208) (p. 18, citing another AEI pub), median and mean state tax rates have been basically unchanged in the past 40 years.

You fix all of this and you basically get back to using what Cass was critiquing -- some measure of real income, which has unambiguously gone up for the vast majority of households. Worth noting that, if anything, conventional (CPI) inflation adjusted measures *understate* income because the CPI *overstates* inflation. And that wages (and incomes) hides all the non-wage benefits that have become increasingly generous, with employee sponsored healthcare being the main one.",flavorless_beef,t2_6g7e1abu,0.94,137,82
611,8crag0,2018-04-16,badeconomics,The Declaration of peasant economics.,"Did you ever thought: Man, if we would decrease the output of an economy, everyone would be more prosperous.

No?

Well, it looks like the [International Congress on Peasant Rights](http://www.global-peasants-rights.com/index.php/en/about-us/congress-2) did.

So what did they do? 
The created a [draft](http://www.global-peasants-rights.com/images/Dokumente/2017_03_06_UN_Draft_E.pdf) declaration on the rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas.

The first thing I found rather suspicious, is the tremendous amount of duplication of other declarations, just with ""people"" and ""human"" swapped out for ""peasants"". 
I'll only give one example since this aspect is not the reason why this is BE, but you will find a lot of aspects (right to work, right to organize in unions, biological diversity, etc.), which are already covered for example by the declaration of human rights, the convention on biological diversity or the convention for the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage.

Article 6, first paragraph
>Peasants and other people working in rural areas have the right to life, physical and 
mental integrity, liberty and security of person. 

Now for the BE Part:
Article 13, second paragraph

>States  shall  create  an  enabling  environment  with  opportunities  for  work  and  that 
provides  remuneration  allowing  for  an  adequate  standard  of  living  for  peasants  and  other 
people  working  in  rural  areas  and  their  families.  In  States  facing  high  levels  of  rural 
poverty  and  in  the  absence  of  employment  opportunities  in  other  sectors,  States  shall  take 
appropriate  measures  to  establish  and  promote  food  systems  that  are  sufficiently  labour-
intensive to contribute to the creation of employment. 

Ok, so let me get this right: We have a country with a high level of rural poverty and no employment opportunities. 
And the way we do this is by reducing the productivity of the individual worker? This even contradicts with their own position:

>Peasants  and  other  people  working  in  rural  areas  have  the  right  to  work,  which 
includes the right to choose freely the way they earn their living. 

Artikel 13, first paragraph

Unfortunately, they couldn't wrap their hand around the concept of productivity being a major factor for the income. 
Remember, we are still dealing with independent, small scale farmers. Consider the following situation:

We have a small scale Farm, one of which this whole fuzz is about. The family uses the most modern equipment it has (which is not very modern, but better than working their fields with spoons)
to work on their land. Both is not much, but it is barely enough to survive.
But it is not enough to let their children go to the nearest school for example. So one could consider them poor, since the draft does not give us an exact definition (but using the definition of extreme poverty wouldn't make any difference in this example) . If we would implement this proposal and force the family to use inferior tools, they would starve, or at least be significantly worse of. Funnily enough, this would result in the state requiring the farmer to use even less productive means of productions.

Considering this, the following article sounds like satire:

Article 15, first paragraph

>Peasants and other people working in rural areas have the right to adequate food and 
the  fundamental  right  to  be  free  from  hunger. This  includes  the  right  to  produce  food  and 
the  right  to  adequate  nutrition,  which  guarantee  the  possibility  of  enjoying  the  highest 
degree of physical, emotional and intellectual development. 

Now for some extra BE candid:

Article 19, 4th paragraph
>States  shall  ensure  that  seeds  of  sufficient  quality  and  quantity  are  available  to 
peasants at the most suitable time for planting, and at an affordable price. 

It is always a good idea for a state to directly control prices. Especially when it comes to goods with literally thousands of variations. \s

R1:

Selection bias is a thing, and is a critique you can level at most economics papers.

The exception is randomized trials (and IVs and RDs on their good days). Because the treatment is assigned randomly, there is no selection bias (Esther Duflo has made the job of conference discussants much harder! Now people have to read papers before they critique them.)

But a little thing like that doesn't stop /r/economics!

Instead people decide to insist that an experimental paper is flawed because of ""selection bias"". Why? It's not clear. It's possible that the experiment design confused them (the main result is an interaction between assignment to treatment and poverty). 

My theory is that they don't know that selection bias is, an actual, real concept, and not a nice catch-all critique you can throw at papers you don't like.

We can do better than that - and you don't need any stats knowledge to do so. Just consult [the chart](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/12/how-to-argue-with-research-you-dont-like/).

Observe:

""Do you like the conclusion implied by the research?"" ""No.""

""Is the research based on an experiment?"" ""Yes.""

""Was the random trial conducted locally or nationally?"" ""Nationally (technically internationally with two local populations).""

""Is the result positive (""it works!"") or negative(""no effect"")? ""Positive"".

**While the policy shows promise, we don't know if it scalable going forward**.

Was that so hard?

The highlight of the linked thread is when it was suggested that a better experiment would be to ""similarly-earning people, measure their ""financial cognition"" then see how earnings change over time."". Which would have an *actual* selection bias.

Regardless of the issues, its a pretty fun book full of 80s nostalgia, video games and a not to distant dystopian future.  

[Here is the amazon page.](        http://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-One-A-Novel/dp/0307887448)

So its a bunch of decades in the future, around 2040ish.  There are major energy shortages (sic) for some reason.  Lots of people in poverty.  The great escape is the virtual reality world everyone links into - think WoW on a grander scale.  The creator is a Steve Jobs/Bill Gates type eccentric who decides to leave his fortune and control over the virtual world to whomever can find the ""egg"" he hid somewhere in the game.  

So many poor people live in these stacks of mobile homes now that land is more scarce, with the rising sea levels and all.  For some reason, its easier to stack mobile homes than to build highrises.  OK.  

The game creator was supposedly this big philanthropist, giving the Virtual Reality kits to poor kids for free so they could attend new public schools online.  Great!  But then everything in the game is charged for - any upgrades, equipment, even virtual land.  And one of the big costs is travel.  So to get around this virtual universe, you need to pay to transport.  Yet, its free to access the virtual universe.  Weird pricing scheme... I see the goal is to try and allow access to the educational parts to poor but also amass revenues from others.  Why not just price discriminate in some other way?  

An evil company wants to win the prize in order to find the ""egg"" and make profitable changes to the world - upgrades, charge for use, ??.  But that's terrible, right?  Because its better that the current owners are simply nickel and diming everyone for travel and avatar upgrades. 

But why don't they just buy the company??  Rather, they are wasting a fortune just trying to find the egg.  All rent seeking.  And given the amount of effort going into finding the egg, why the hell did the supposedly ""benevolent"" creator of the system encourage this rent seeking??  If he really wanted to do good, why didn't he just make the virtual world free for all?  Is there a reason that any resources in the virtual world are made artificially scarce?  Wouldn't a fixed fee be far more efficient than charging a price on every item in the virtual world?  These people clearly don't know about the efficiency of a fixed fee (or two-part tariff when MC=0).

Finally, one of the players wants to win the egg for nobel reasons.  She wants to use the fortune to help end the world crisis.  HOW??  Who knows?  Having lots of money means you can solve the worlds problems, of course.  This completely ignores the fact that the lack of energy isn't the result of people not having enough money, but rather that THERE ISN""T ENOUGH ENERGY!

**What's wrong with the model?**

For the vast majority of models in time series econometrics, a requirement for the model to be unbiased / consistent is for the data to be **stationary**. Put simply, this means that observations are converted into log difference or into a % change instead of using it as is. This is because when we examine things like asset prices, macro or micro economic variables or anything that grows over time, there is a natural upward trend in the movement of these variables. This causes 'false' correlation with the associated data points, biasing inferential statistics and making your model biased.

With this information, we can say that the model used was biased because:

* Contemporaneous correlation: A weekly average of oil prices is not stationary, so a natural upward trend in the price of the asset is in the data, which means that the R\^2 of 0.96 he got is wrong and the correlation he establishes is highly biased.
* Volatility clustering in asset prices that see 'jumps' tend to be quite strong. Clustering makes the effects of price jumps and serial correlation more pronounced, making the lack of consideration of auto correlation even worse in his regression.
* Weekly frequency when dealing with gas prices don't reflect the nature of how gas prices behave (they are volatile and are typically examined at higher frequencies)
* It's also a single variable regression, so there are several omitted variables (ie the regression is way too simplistic)

**So the model is biased. What does the same model look like with unbiased data?**

I first began by replicating the study with the same underlying data as the model used in the twitter post. I used DHHNGSP (fred) for gas prices. For approval ratings, I used [all voter approval ratings for Biden from fivethirtyeight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/). Both are at a daily frequency, beginning in late January until yesterday.

When replicating the regression I used first differenced / % change gas prices at the daily frequency instead of a weekly average (Data was stationary after first order differencing with 2 different unit root tests) . For the dependent variable, I used log differenced daily approval ratings. This assumes the following specification:

    Approval% = Gas_price%*β + ε

After running a robust SE regression with % change gas prices on approval ratings, we see an abysmally low R\^2 of [0.0007](https://imgur.com/a/ZUwNMKI), which is about as far away as you can get from the R\^2 of 0.96 that the authors estimated. For comparison, here's the scatter plot with the [non stationary data](https://imgur.com/a/6ZgbyiO) from the original twitter link, and here's the scatter plot with [stationary data](https://imgur.com/a/h7ACmVI).

As you can probably tell from the two graphs, the difference in the modelled relationship strikingly different and when the data is unbiased.

**A simple linear regression doesn't work in this case. What other models should I use?**

Because time dependency is important for the reasons mentioned above, we would most likely use an **Autoregressive process, Error correction model or a Vector Auto Regression**. These models formally account for the serial correlation in the data, which means that the estimates would be more robust than ones derived from a linear regression. Because we're interested in examining the granular details of the relationship between the two, I use a VAR process to model for these variables .

**VAR specification**

Through lag optimization, we settle with a VAR(1) process. (AIC and FPE gave 4 lags, but HQIC and SIC gave 1 lag). Because we assume volatility clusters strongly with gas prices and have a strong preference towards less noise, I settle with 1 lag. This follows the following generalized specification:

    k_{t } =  A_{0}+ A_1k_{t-1} +......A_nk_{t-n} + e_{t}
    A_{t } =  k_{0}+ k_1A_{t-1} +......k_nA_{t-n} + e_{t}

Though the VAR model has quite a few inferential statistics, we're only interested in the impulse response functions between the variables. This is the irf with [Approval as Y and Gas prices as X](https://imgur.com/a/JXFKUsa) and this is the irf which is [vice versa.](https://imgur.com/a/ik2xeMb)

We can observe persistent change in the impulse responsiveness between the two variables past the observed time horizon in the initial regressions, (we only examine up to 12 days because of exponential decay). This clearly shows that time dependency needs to be accounted for in this specific relationship.

For people that are familiar with the VAR model, these are the [tests for structural breaks](https://imgur.com/a/rqOAL9o) and [Cholesky decomposition](https://imgur.com/a/eUMTqUr).

**Key takeaways:**

* The graphs that the twitter dudes posted wouldn't pass in an introductory econometrics course.
* Simple fixes would be to add more variables to RHS and to make sure your data is stationary
* A more sophisticated fix would be to use a model that formally models for autocorrelation
* R\^2 tends to be low empirically and shouldn't really be the focal point of your inferential statistics
* Never assume causality from a model: Especially if your model is a 1 variable linear regression

EDIT:

A few changes proposed by u/db1923 have been made for the initial regression.

I initially used level Approval ratings because at log difference, the adf statistics showed even worse spurious correlation than the initial level data, along with reversing the correlation. This was even more pronounced at the second difference, where each observation was so close to zero it was unusable

[This](https://imgur.com/a/h7ACmVI) is the new scatter plot with % change in approval ratings on % change of gas prices. When doing this, the R\^2 decreased from 0.003 to [0.0007](https://imgur.com/a/ZUwNMKI). I didn't think it could get any worse, but there we go.

    Approval% = Gas_price%*β + ε

As for the VAR model, the AR structure already deals with the unit root, so it's fine as is.

What we can take away from these changes is that this regression should never have happened in the first place.

Let’s take a look at how they get there:

> A person who is looking for a full-time job that pays a living wage — but who can't find one — is unemployed. If you accept that definition, the true unemployment rate in the U.S. is a stunning 26.1%, according to an important new dataset shared exclusively with ""Axios on HBO.""

Ah, okay. I can accept taking umbrage with measures of unemployment not capturing the true extent of hardship faced by American workers. So if you think you have a metric that does a better job of capturing that and feel like calling it unemployment, more power to you I guess.

> Why it matters: The official unemployment rate is artificially depressed by excluding people who might be earning only a few dollars a week. It also excludes anybody who has stopped looking for work or is discouraged by a lack of jobs or by the demands of child care during the coronavirus crisis.

This is conceivably true. However, there are also several official metrics of unemployment that arguably do a better job of measuring such things than the standard unemployment metric, [which is U-3](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE). There is a nuanced balance to be had here, because you don’t want to be including people in your rate’s base that have no interest in being in the labor force. By that, I mean people like students, the disabled, and stay-at-home parents prior to COVID’s arrival. Some may be interested in working, but even for many among those certainly not full-time.

> If you measure the unemployed as anybody over 16 years old who isn't earning a living wage, the rate rises even further, to 54.6%. For Black Americans, it's 59.2%.

We’re starting to go off the rails here a bit. I guess that could be true if you defined unemployment that way, but why would you expect any 16-year-old to be able to earn a living wage (whatever it’s defined as)? There are also about 30 millions Americans that are age 70 or older that have long retired, why would you expect them to be employed?

> The backstory: The official definition of unemployment can be traced back to the 1870s, when a Massachusetts statistician named Carroll Wright diagnosed what he referred to as ""industrial hypochondria"".
By restricting the ""unemployed"" label to men who “really want employment,” Wright managed to minimize the unemployment figure.
Wright went on to found the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and he brought his unemployment definition with him.
To this day, to be officially counted as unemployed you need to be earning no money at all, and you need to be actively looking for work.

That’s the first I’ve heard about Carroll Wright in my life and I have no idea to the extent those history tidbits are true. That being said, I’d like to zero in on that final bullet point. It’s true that U-3 only accounts for fully unemployed people that are seeking a job (I wouldn’t say they are earning no money either since most will be receiving unemployment insurance, but that’s an aside). However, there are many alternative official forms of unemployment one can use that take a more expansive view of what constitutes being unemployed.

For example, another one of the [most common official measures is U-6](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE?fbclid=IwAR10LL2oZ7Cy_OwqcL6uYIFMxUF19oKcWpFlbqciNnLCB1ZUa4pxbNgAimU), which [broadly speaking](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm) is supposed to represent an upper bound of any American marginally attached to the labor force. That means it includes anyone that sought a job in the past year and left the labor force discouraged, those working part-time that would like to work full-time, the underemployed that are working jobs beneath their skill level, and more - including parents that stopped looking for work because they left the labor force to look after their children during the pandemic.

> By the numbers: In January, when the official rate of unemployment was 3.6%, the true rate was seven times greater — 23.4%. That's according to new calculations from the [Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity](https://www.lisep.org/), founded by Gene Ludwig, a former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency.

Alright, now we are really fucking getting goofy. If you want to take a look at the Ludwig Institute’s figures to see how they are deriving these totals, you can go to their website and [download their full methodology here](https://assets.website-files.com/5f67c16a6ca3251ecc11eca7/5f84cf8d3fbecf746ac890a4_Methodology%20for%20the%20LISEP%20OCT13.pdf). I’m instead just going to highlight what I think is the most important passage that highlights how they derived what constitutes a living wage:

> To be employed for the purposes of LISEP’s true employment concept, an individual must either have a full-time job (35+ hours per week) or have a part-time job but no desire to be full-time (e.g., students). The second stipulation is that an individual must earn at least $20,000 annually. This annual wage is adjusted for inflation, calculated in January 2020 dollars. ($20,000 was chosen because LISEP concluded that anything beneath that wage could fairly be considered a poverty wage, based on the U.S. poverty guidelines put out by the Department of Health and Human Services, which considers a three-person household to be in poverty if it has an income of less than $20,000 per year).

So, an INDIVIDUAL that is earning less than $20k is unemployed, because that is less than the poverty threshold for a THREE-PERSON HOUSEHOLD. I find that particularly problematic for many reasons, including [because a majority of Americans that are age 18-29 are still living with their parents](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/04/a-majority-of-young-adults-in-the-u-s-live-with-their-parents-for-the-first-time-since-the-great-depression/). Many are living quite reasonably well and often as full-time students. Not to mention that $20k constitutes very different standards of living in rural Alabama than it does in downtown San Francisco. To me a far more reasonable metric would be something like say, 50% of the local median wage.

Regardless, how well does their “true unemployment” metric hold up as some sort of composite measure of wages and unemployment over time?

[Yikes.](https://imgur.com/g08kg9h)

Well look at that. It turns out that the True Unemployment rate has recovered all the way to 2016 levels. I guess pack it all up boys, no need for expanding the pandemic UI or more stimulus because this economy is back to booming baby.

That is honestly so fucking stupid and reflects such a disconnect with reality that I hope literally everyone who is not employed by Axios or the Ludwig Institute can self-evidently see it's not true. I would have hoped that alone would have caused major alarm bells to go off that their metric is not doing a good job of capturing whatever the hell it is they are intending to measure, but alas, we evidently do not live in such a world. 

Whatever your complaints are about U-3, U-6 or other similar official statistics like the Labor Force Participation rate, at least none of them show such absurdities.

Relevant [tweet is here](https://twitter.com/AltmanEcon/status/1698833933197074731), courtesy of Daniel Altman, chief economist at Instawork:

>Yes, real wages are 1% higher than they were before the pandemic.
  
>But real wages rose by much more early in the pandemic – they had to, since working was riskier and labor was in shorter supply – and then they declined for TWO WHOLE YEARS.
  
>That's why people were/are miserable.

He then posts a chart showing a massive spike in average hourly earnings at the beginning of the pandemic. His claims are false.
  

  
The problem is a change in composition—a lot of low-wage workers lost their jobs (just look at the [employment ratio](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EMRATIO)—it drops a full ten percent at the start of the pandemic), so they dropped out of the calculation. Average goes up, but it's not like employers handed out a 7% real raise to the workers that were left.
  

  
To see this, you can look at the [Atlanta Fed Wage Growth Tracker](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker). The advantage of this tool is that it tracks wage changes in the same individual, thus solving the composition issue. Nominal wage gains were essentially flat at the start of the pandemic, and this is true for both low and high wage levels.

[As u/Integralds points out, the COVID-induced deflation [seen here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL#0) also played some role in the jump.]
  

  
The same issue goes for the long drop that Altman highlights. It was a mixture of real declines (due to sticky nominal wages and increasing inflation) and composition effects (low-wage workers coming back to the labor force, thus dragging the average back down).

> Minimum wage laws make it illegal to pay less than a government-specified price for labor. By the simplest and most basic economics, a price artificially raised tends to cause more to be supplied and less to be demanded than when prices are left to be determined by supply and demand in a free market. The result is a surplus, whether the price that is set artificially high is that of farm produce or labor.

This is a common fallacy of applying microeconomics to macroeconomics.  It's often accompanied by a supply-and-demand graph which shows the price set higher, the quantity demanded lower, and marks the gap between as ""unemployment"".

Let's start with some empirical data and move to the explanation of the mistake afterwards.  Fancy explanations don't really matter if reality says you're wrong.

There has in fact been a steady decrease in minimum wage as a portion of per-capita national income since 1960, with minimum wage trending roughly around a real minimum wage of $2,080 based in 1960.  The real mean wage has increased over this time, which indicates sag:  if raising minimum wage causes wage compression, then an expanding distance between minimum and mean wage indicates negative wage compression or ""sag"".

When measuring minimum wage as a portion of per-capita national income using the World Bank figures, the ratio of minimum to mean wage steadily widens as minimum wage falls.  Moreover, in periods between 1983 and 2018, we have minimum wages at the same levels spanning across decades, and so can measure this in varied economic conditions.  Even when measuring from the early 1990s to similar levels around 2010, the correlation is tight.

U3 unemployment, plotted against minimum wage as a portion of per-capita income, ranged 3.5% to 8% with minimum wage levels between 50% and 80% of per-capita income.  This includes levels spanning of 5% and 7.5% U3 with minimum wage at 50% GNI/C; levels as low as 4.5% and as high as 8% with minimum wage at 55% GNI/C; and levels as low as 3.5% and as high as 6% with minimum wage near 70% GNI/C.

United States minimum wage has spent a large amount of history between 20% and 40% of GNI/C.  U3 has robustly spanned 4% to 8% in this time, with three points in between going as high as 10%.  All this scattering of the unemployment rate is caused by the continuous downtrend of minimum wage across time:  the unemployment rate has spiked up and down through recessions and recoveries across the decades, and the numbers on the plot against minimum wage just go along for the ride.

So what happened to [supply and demand](http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BasicModel.png)?

That chart shows a microeconomic effect:  the quantity demanded of some good or service decreases with an increase in price.

As it turns out, labor isn't a single good.  This is self-evident because different labor-hours are purchased at different prices.

If you walk into a grocery store and you see Cloverfield Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, $4, and directly next to it you see Cloverfield Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, $2, with signs indicating they were packed in the same plant on the same day from the same stock, your quantity demanded of Cloverfield Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, $4 is…zero.  It doesn't matter if you are desperate for milk.  There is this milk here for half as much.  Unless you *run out of $2 milk that is exactly the same as $4 milk*, you're going to buy $2 milk.

Interestingly, in 1961, minimum wage was 0.775 × national per-capita income; it was at that time 0.610 × mean wage.  In 2010, minimum wage was 0.309 × GNI/C and 0.377 × mean wage.  There's a pretty strong correlation between these two figures, but let's take the conceptual numbers for simplicity.

First, the mean wage.  The division of labor reduces the amount of labor invested in producing.  Putting division of labor theory aside (because it can be trivially proven false), an increase in productivity reduces labor-hours to produce a thing (by definition).  We can make a table by hand with 3 labor-hours of work *or* we can invest a total of 1 labor-hour of work between designing, building, maintaining, and operating a machine to make the table in 1 labor-hour.

The mean wage is all labor wage divided by all labor-hours, and so all new labor-saving processes converge toward a strict mean average labor-hour cost of the mean wage (again, this is by definition).  Some will be above, some will be below, of course.

Let's say the minimum wage is 0.25 × mean wage.  Replacing that 3 labor-hours of minimum-wage work with 1 labor-hour of efficient work *increases* costs by, on average, 1/3.  The demand for higher-wage labor is undercut by a cheaper production price.

Minimum wage becomes 0.5 × mean wage.  Replacing the 3 labor-hours with 1 labor-hour in this model cuts your costs to 2/3. You *save* 1/3 of your labor costs.

Now you have two excess workers.

Are their hands broken?

So long as you don't have a liquidity crisis—people here want to work, people here want to buy, but the consumers don't have money so the workers don't have jobs—you have two workers who can be put to work to supply more.  The obvious solution for any liquidity crisis is to recognize people aren't working because there are jobs for them but no little tokens to pass back and forth saying they worked and are entitled to compensation in the form of some goods or services (somebody else's labor) and inject stimulus.  (This actually doesn't work all the time:  in a post-scarcity economy where there is no need to exchange money because all people have all the goods they could ever want and no labor need be invested in producing anything anyone could ever want, unemployment goes to 100% and nothing will stop it.  Until we can spontaneously instantiate matter by mere thought, the above principles apply.)

It turns out there are a countable but uncounted number of those little supply-demand charts describing all the different types and applications of labor, and they're always shifting. Your little business probably follows that chart; the greater macroeconomy?  It's the whole aggregate of all the shifts, of new businesses, of new demand.

That's why Caplan, Friedman, and Sowell are wrong; and that's why the data consistently proves them wrong:

The panic about TPP is reaching ""conservative fear about gay marriage"" levels even though:

* The US still has tremendous leverage even in free trade pacts and has in the past ignored or even sidestepped international bodies when it suits economic and political interests

* Aside from some isolated incidents on /r/rage, not only is being in consumer (and arguably car/mortgage) debt not an imprisonable offense that bonds someone to the debtor but it's not a criminal offense

* Consumer credit card and related debts are routinely written off to collection agencies for 20% of the principal to say nothing of the many states where debts cannot be pursued after 7 years

* While educational debt is a big problem, especially the size of the principal, we've had grants as well as legislation ensuring the interest rates are subsidized, deferred, or are just lower than than the rate charged for other types of loans.  The size of the principal requires reform in higher education which is a whole different issue than the TPP.

* Feudalism also wouldn't happen because in a world of free labor, no debtor or country would want to keep you around with free room and board

* While the wealthy obviously enjoy far more leisure time including vacations and multiple properties, those are all options still available to the middle class which is also still here.  Technology has also expanded the scope of and lowered the cost of leisure time (reddit included) and vacationing to new places is easier now than before (barring unrelated TSA regulations) thanks to that technology.

* While income inequality is wider than it has been since the 80's or the 50's (depending on which figures you use), **material inequality** is far far narrower than ever before.  Access to information, services, most electronic goods, and to influence other people are measurably more equal than they were in the past.

* The demographics of the wealthy have also changed in the past two decades with far more ""working rich"" whose assets are in capital instead of land or one specific firm or plain out inheritors as it's been since well, forever.

624,c6qlku,2019-06-29,badeconomics,Horrifically bad economics in the iCarly fandom,"Some background: in season 2, episode 8 of iCarly, Freddie Benson and Sam Puckett shared their first kiss, as the two had never kissed anyone previously. This kiss remained a secret, until in season 3, episode 1, Sam told her best friend, Carly, that she kissed Freddie. This angers Carly, resulting in Carly interrogating both Sam and Freddie throughout the episode, and forcing them to promise to never keep secrets from her again.

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nicegirls/comments/ba5v2o/we_forget_carly_was_the_real_nice_girl_sometimes) asserts that Carly was, in fact, jealous that Sam and Freddie kissed. However, some commenters are quick to state that Carly was not jealous, and simply got angry because Sam and Freddie had kept a secret from her. This latter opinion is bad economics.

First, consider the fact that Freddie had a known crush on Carly for a very long time prior to his kissing Sam. Carly always rejected his advances, but he was always there for her, should she ever reciprocate his feelings. This allows us to construct an intertemporal model of choice. Using [McCall 1970](https://educnet.enpc.fr/pluginfile.php/29349/mod_resource/content/1/Mc%20Call_1970.pdf), we can construct a Bellman equation where the choice variable is whether or not Carly reciprocates a suitor's feelings. 

Let V_s be the value of being single and V_r be the value of being in a relationship. Assume that a suitor appears in every period where Carly is single, and the suitor's desirability is IID. In her state of being single, Carly gets a ""utility from singlehood"" in each period, which we'll define as S. She is also free to receive suitor advances in the future, as long as she remains single.

If Carly reciprocates, she receives a ""utility from being in a relationship"" in each period, which is the same as the suitor's desirability. We'll define this as R. With probability p, she will break up with the suitor in each period, at which point she will return to being single. With probability (1-p), the relationship will last. If Carly does not reciprocate, she will receive a suitor in the next period. Her utility of being in a relationship from this suitor is R'.

Bearing in mind that the future is discounted, [these are the relevant Bellman equations](https://imgur.com/a/oRYUwbE).

The reason Carly did not accept Freddie's advances is because she has a reservation desirability, which Freddie did not meet. She will accept a suitor whose desirability is above her reservation, and reject anyone whose desirability is below her reservation.

Now, Carly finds out that Freddie kissed Sam, and is quite possibly developing feelings for her. This adds an entirely new dimension to her optimization problem, as now *Freddie is no longer guaranteed to court her in every period*. In other words, she no longer has a guaranteed suitor in every period. With probability p*, she will have no suitor, i.e. she faces no R' value. As such, [these are now the relevant Bellman equations](https://imgur.com/a/xfGCNwo).

Given this, it is clear that Carly was most certainly jealous that Sam and Freddie had kissed. The value from her choosing not to reciprocate had plummeted, and as a result, the difference between the value gained from not reciprocating and reciprocating with Freddie had shrunk, and perhaps reciprocation now yielded more value.

If you don't like McCall's framework, perhaps you'll prefer [the Huggett 1993 framework](http://econ.ucsb.edu/~mkapicka/RG/Huggett.pdf). Let Carly be a representative agent who wants to maximize utility over her entire life, where the variable acting as the maximizer is an index of social activities, and utility is given form as a power function. She is given a ""shadow endowment"" in each period that enables her to engage in social activities. However, each period can also be one of two states: good or bad. In the good state, she socializes as normal. However, in the bad state, she needs to be in a relationship to socialize well (e.g. say she and two other friends want to go out, but those two are in a relationship, leading to her possibly getting third-wheeled). She controls for these states with securities. The relevant security for the good state is a risky security of a suitor who meets her reservation desirability level. She may or may not receive such a suitor, but all is fine since this is a good state. The relevant security for the bad state was the risk-free Freddie. However, with Freddie potentially gaining feelings for Sam, he, too, becomes a risky security.

626,2twaoe,2015-01-28,badeconomics,"Is a basic income badeconomics? No, not really. But there is a lot of badeconomics in the /r/basicincome FAQ (Part 1)","Basic income gets a lot of crap on this subreddit. None of think it's badeconomics in and of itself, but many of us have noticed that there's a pretty strong correlation between badeconomics and people advocating for a basic income.

Maybe we've been cherry picking. Maybe most basic income on reddit is badeconomics for the same reason that most Keynesian economics is badeconomics, and most anarchocapitalism is badeconomics. *Most* stuff is badeconomics.

But if it's not, the one place where you'd hope to find basic income arguments that past muster would be the ""Basic Income FAQ"" at /r/basicincome. Let's do a deep dive into it, and see what we find:

> **Eliminates the ""unemployment trap"".** Under current systems, when someone gets a job they lose most of their welfare payments. This means they can go from not working at all to working a full week without significantly increasing their income. This is a disincentive to work. Under basic income, when people got a job they would retain the same basic income payment, with their salary added to it, so the disincentive no longer exists.

This is reasonable! See Greg Mankiw on [Poverty Traps](http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2009/11/poverty-trap.html). 

“Notice that as earned income rises from about $15,000 to $30,000, income after taxes and transfers is roughly flat. Indeed, it could even fall. The bottom line: If you are poor, the government is inadvertently ensuring that you have little incentive to try to improve your condition.”

This is a big problem, and one of the best arguments for basic income, in my opinion. Glad that it's on top!

This is *good economics*.

***

> **Reduces government bureaucracy**. A lot of government workers are required to ensure that welfare recipients are not claiming their benefits fraudulently, and to administer the complicated system of welfare payments and tax credits. The increased need for personal tax advisers also sucks skilled workers out of the productive sector. A basic income would hugely simplify the welfare system by replacing most of these bureaucracies, which would reduce its administrative cost significantly.

This is pretty innaccurate. I'll let Krugman handle it:

""As Mike says, this notion rests on the belief that the welfare state is a crazily complicated mess of inefficient programs, and that simplification would save enough money to pay for universal grants that are neither means-tested nor conditional on misfortune. But the reality is nothing like that. The great bulk of welfare-state spending comes from a handful of major programs, and these programs are fairly efficient, with low administrative costs.

Actually, the cost of bureaucracy is in general vastly overestimated. Compensation of workers accounts for only around 6 percent of non defense federal spending, and only a fraction of that compensation goes to people you could reasonably call bureaucrats.*

There might be some slight gains, but they just aren't as big as BI advocates claim.

I dub this claim *bad economics*.

***

> **Greatly reduces fraud/waste/abuse**. When welfare subsidies are contingent on conditions like employment, income level, number of hours worked, family status, etc, there are opportunities to game the system, either by illegally lying (fraud) or by simply obeying the economic incentives put in front of you (waste/abuse). These cause losses of real economic value, which are paid for by every taxpayer. Removing this incentive structure allows confidence in the welfare system's ability to reach people exactly as intended.

What?

First of all, my understanding is that fraud rates under the current system are actually fairly low. For example, [CBPP has only 1% of SNAP benefits being trafficed](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=3239). Heck, if anything, there's a much bigger problem with *qualified* people not getting their benefits - [for example, the median county only has EITC take up rates of 16.2%](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/01/30-variation-eitc-takeup-county-harris)

In any case, I don't really see the argument here. Why is fraud less likely to occur under a basic system than a means-tested system? It's much easier to falsify the existence of a given individual than it is to create an employment record, etc. Get a falsified birth record, and collect BI! 

Maybe there could be something where bureaucrats check these numbers, but that's cutting against the ""reduces bureaucracy"" argument.

I dub this claim *bad economics*.

***

> **Guarantees a minimum living standard**. Though it's subjective/politicized, people may be entitled to a certain basic standard of living, regardless of whether they are momentarily able to participate in the labor market. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 25, states, ""Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control."" (United Nations, (UN)).

Uh. OK.

This is a normative claim, not a positive one. Nothing wrong with it. 

It's not badeconomics, it's just noteconomics.

***

> **Increases bargaining power for workers**. Workers will be able to afford to refuse a job if the employer abuses its oligopoly or the workspace has poor conditions, so firms will be forced to improve the employment conditions and wages for their workers. This will happen as a natural result of negotiation between firms and workers, and will not require government intervention or unionization.

What? *What?*

As reddit's biggest defender of monopsony models (as a useful framework for thinking about the labor market), this is a little unclear to me.

Let's be generous. Best as I can tell, they are thinking about this using some sort of Rubinstein bargaining framework. Basic income gives the laborer more bargaining power, because they are more able to hold out for better offers. That's not unreasonable. Indeed, it's something that I think should be incorporate into a labor market model. 

[Bowles (1992)](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~bowles/1992EJPE.pdf) does a good job of creating such a model, and that model is going to underly a lot of my thinking here (mostly because this was a homework question when I took his class 12 years ago). I'm not going to go into too much detail for space reasons (and you can just click the link) but this model differs from the standard neoclassical goods market in three respects:

* Employee effort enters into the production function. That is to say, work productivity increases with effort, and effort  causes disutility in the workforce.

* Productivity is noisy. Effort and hours enter into the production function, but so does a random exogenous number. 

* Employers are unable to costlessly monitor employee effort. They may pay a cost in order to (probabilistically) monitor  workers' effort level. If they observe a worker with low effort, they will fire the worker.

* Workers have a reservation wage - usually interpreted as unemployment insurance.

This has a lot of very nice properties. Using this model, labor markets do not clear (there is always a non-zero amount of unemployed people). Workers choose an effort level that equates the marginal benefit of effort (ie, the increased probability of keeping your job over your reservation wage) with the marginal cost (ie, the disutility of effort). Having job is valuable - the present value of ""having a job"" is the reservation wage plus employment rents (those of you who recall the [Harris and Todaro AotW]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1xgh6e/article_of_the_week_migration_unemployment_and/) might notice some interesting parallels).

Workers choose an effort level to maximize their expected utility, employers choose a monitoring strategy, a wage, and worker hours to maximize profit. Both of these choices are mutual best responses.

Ok, back to talking about basic income.

So, using this framework, the way a basic income would affect a worker's bargaining power is by changing their reservation wage.
The problem here is that workers are *already getting* unemployment insurance under the status quo. Basic income advocates typically argue in favor of replacing current welfare and unemployment insurance payments with a basic income. In other words, you take the reservation wage and put it on both sides of the equation. This *reduces* your bargaining power relative to the status quo.

Moreover, the basic income would have to be substantially smaller than the current unemployment insurance in order to pay off everyone and maintain current levels of economic productivity and investment. [Bowles (1992)](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~bowles/1992EJPE.pdf) looks into it pretty thoroughly, and figure out the biggest possible MW under this scenario is equal to the current reservation wage times the (1 – the labor participation rate). Bowles calculated this to be $4,208 in his 1992 paper. Updating his numbers to the present day, I’m getting $8,019.

This claim is *bad economics*.

***

> Lowers need for government regulations on the labor market. Policies such as the minimum wage will become less necessary with the basic income, as people will already get enough money to live on from the basic income. And negotiating power for workers will increase. This will allow the government to remove some of the regulations on the labor market, creating a freer market and providing benefits for both employers and employees.

This basically follows from the former. Again, it doesn’t make any sense. As discussed in the previous section, it doesn’t make any sense to think of the basic income as something which increases workers’ bargaining power. 

This claim is *bad economics*.

***

> Reduces illegal immigration. With the minimum wage obsolete, manual labor can be priced at its fair-market value, meaning illegal immigrants will not stand to gain as much by working illegally and being paid under-the-table. The US's neighbors to the south would suddenly realize that the only profitable way to enter America is via the proper legal system. And all with no need for a militarized border!

What? This is such a bizarre reading of why illegal immigrants come to United States. It isn’t because of the minimum wage – it’s because wages *generally* increase when you cross the border, as worker productivity increases (for various reasons – better institutions, higher capitalization, etc.).

This claim is *bad economics*.

627,941yol,2018-08-02,badeconomics,>When what you think is low-hanging fruit actually turns out to be Tantalus' fruit and R1's YOU,"I'm an undergrad, so I'm mostly a lurker on this sub and have yet to post an R1. I believed that would change when I saw NBA player De'Aaron Fox post what appeared to be low-hanging fruit:

[She making more than me after taxes 💀](https://twitter.com/swipathefox/status/1025061265868091392)

I thought that this was low-hanging fruit that could be R1'd with a bit of effort and perhaps a discussion of marginal tax rates. So, I began typing out my post:

*For context, he's referring to how another NBA player, Blake Griffin, was ordered to [pay $3,096,000 per year](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/08/02/blake-griffin-child-support-payments-detroit-pistons-los-angeles-court) in child support to his ex-fiancee Brynn Cameron.*


*So, we begin with $3,096,000 in annual income for Cameron. I tried to look for other possible sources of income, but to no avail. Just to add something else, I added the [median annual earnings for white, 25 to 54-year-old women in the United States](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/wkyeng.t03.htm), which comes out to $43,628 per year ($839 * 52) (granted, these stats are from the second quarter of 2018). So let's say Cameron has an annual income of $3,139,628, and let's ignore taxes.*

*Fox is currently on a [rookie scale salary](https://hoopshype.com/player/deaaron-fox/salary/). He will earn $5,470,920 in the 2018/2019 season, and if his team, the Sacramento Kings, picks up his team option, he will earn $6,392,760 and $8,099,627 in 2019/2020 and 2020/2021, respectively. If the Kings choose to pick up his qualifying offer for the 2021/2022 season, he will make at least $10,740,105, granted that he isn't offered more money (I believe that's how it works). In addition, Fox [secured a shoe deal with Nike](https://www.seccountry.com/kentucky/deaaron-fox-nike-shoe-deal), though I couldn't find how much money he would receive from it. Let's ignore that shoe deal and just stick to his NBA salary.*

*So now, we get to the fun part: calculating Fox's net pay. I'll be using the [tables from this article](https://www.bna.com/taxes-ballhog-majority-n73014470964/) to aid my calculations. Thus, we take out federal tax, state tax, a jock tax, escrow, an agent fee, a 401k contribution, and add a return on escrow and a shortfall return. For 2018/2019, Fox is making*

This is when I stopped typing the post and started making calculations. Oh boy. His tax bill, according to my calculations, was the following: 2,024,240.4 + 727,632.36 + 164,127.6 + 547,092 + 18,000 = $3,481,092.36. That's more than half of his 2018/2019 salary. I then calculated his escrow return (170,540.4 + 61,302.36 -> 460,920 - 231,842.76 = 229,077.24) and added it to his after-tax salary to get $2,218,904.88. 

At this point, I pretty much conceded defeat. The largest shortfall return I found was $214,691, belonging to James Harden, who is a superstar. The fact that De'Aaron 1. is not a superstar and 2. lives in California means his shortfall return probably won't make up the $920,723.12 difference I calculated between his income and Cameron's. I considered including an estimate for his Nike endorsement, but I believe that's subject to at least federal and state taxes, meaning around 50% of his endorsement will be taxed (marginal tax rates of 37% + 13.3%). To make up the $920,723.12 difference, his endorsement would have to be at least $1,830,463.46. For reference, the #1 pick from his draft class received a $1.5 million endorsement (Fox was the 5th pick). Even if Fox received a $1.5 million endorsement, he'd receive at most $754,500. He would then need a $166,223 shortfall return, and superstar players such as LeBron James and Stephen Curry received ~$200,000 in shortfall returns. Basically, it would take the absolute best-case scenarios for my R1 to be correct.

Watch out for [what you think](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Tantalus/tantalus.html) is low-hanging fruit.

Tl;dr: My R1 attempt didn't exactly go as planned, but I learned a lot about NBA salary taxes from it!

EDIT: I made a poor mistake in the income tax calculations and forgot to make the 37% and 13.3% *marginal* taxes. However, after plugging numbers into a [calculator](https://www.irscalculators.com/tax-calculator), it doesn't seem to change the fact that I'm wrong here; I also forgot to take out a jock tax yesterday when running my calculations since I couldn't find an exact methodology, but it seems to be ~$200k for California players. This is more than the difference between my calculations for his federal/state taxes and his actual taxes according to a calculator.

EDIT 2: Blake [only has to pay 32k a month](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.yahoo.com/amphtml/sports/no-blake-griffin-isnt-playing-258000-per-month-child-support-230210368.html). However, neither Fox nor I knew this as this information came out the day after Fox's Tweet, so correcting him wouldn't really be an R1.",terrydragon2,t2_j6qsj,0.95,114,14

I will not focus on their leftist dictatorship, nor on the fact that Cuba has had the ability to trade with most of the west for some time now (as proven by the fact that I can acquire a Cuban cigar in my local supermarket), or that Cuba could always trade with some superpowers. 

The [comment in question](https://np.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/q15m71/record_number_of_cuban_players_12_defect_during/hfcnufk/) was this. 

> A country who gets stomped on by the biggest country in the world and said country forces other countries not to trade w/ them and that leads to trouble? Nope, must be their left leaning policies??

And a couple of responses to a comment I made, [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/q15m71/record_number_of_cuban_players_12_defect_during/hfdduin/) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/q15m71/record_number_of_cuban_players_12_defect_during/hfdfazr/).

The first response says

> I love when people try to say this like they know the country would still be rough even if it wasn't fucked by America. We have no clue how it'd be doing because we can only see it for how it's been treated. Being fucked by America has lead it to its current political state.

And the second one

> The embargo isn’t the reason they are poor? Do you know how international trade works?

While it is true that the island is in a very rough condition, and that the USA does have en embargo with Cuba, one cannot assume one causes the other. Many poor countries don't have embargoes, yet, they are poor. And with the help of International Finance, we can see how the problems are not caused by the embargo, but by Cuba's terrible macroeconomic policies. 

Now let's get a little context on the Cuban economy:

While the government's grip on the Cuban economy has certainly lessened since the 80s, the state still control's around three quarters of Cuba's economic activity, and employs around the same ammount of people.

> [The government, both directly and through state-owned enterprises, was still the source of more than three-quarters of Cuba’s economic activity.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/28/what-we-know-about-cubas-economy/) 

Not only this, but wages are abysmaly low, averaging around [$50 per month](https://tradingeconomics.com/cuba/wages). The government maintains a list of private sector occupations, mostly related to tourism (like restaurants and taxi drivers). Those Cubans who work in the touristic sectors that do price their services in convertible pesos make much more money than workers on government salaries. [This creates an odd situation where highly trained and well-educated workers in occupations mainly provided by the state — engineers, say, academics or even doctors — are incentivised to take jobs as waiters and taxi drivers.](https://www.ft.com/content/98c2b666-41cd-3635-bc03-2f8fb6d8b1b7)

Cuba is also incredibly unproductive on the agricultural sector. 

> [Farm yields are pathetically low, despite Cuba having possibly the richest soil of any tropical country in the world](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/28/organic-or-starve-can-cubas-new-farming-model-provide-food-security)

Productivity is low for a number of reasons — lack of machinery, government as the sole crop purchaser, other various bad policies, and the legacy of a system that was more geared toward producing sugar exports rather than food. On top of this, it's archaic food industry, which heavily depends on fuel, has been in crisis since 2016, because they imported most of it's fuel from Venezuela, at a premium price. But Venezuela has faced an economic collapse for a good amount of years now. Since Cuba can't get oil, many farmers have resorted to using very unproductive methods, like using animals.

Now, we can go on to the worst thing about Cuba's macroeconomic policy: it's dual currency system. For a long time Cuba had two currencies, one pegged to the dollar 1 to 1, and one that was worth much less (around .042 USD right now). The former was used to trade, and the latter was used domestically. A country can create their own currency and it can be used for domestic transactions, but for international transactions, it must use a foreign currency, generally dollars, yens, euros or pounds. Cuba used their dual currency system, to hoard international reserves which they used to buy imported products, mainly food, since it's important and they can't produce as much as they needed, and it was then repriced in domestic pesos. 

Now, regarding the embargo: It is not a blockade; countries can trade with Cuba, in fact it's [27% of their GDP.](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS?most_recent_value_desc=false) This would not be the case if a blockade was in place. Hell, in fact, most of Cuba's food imports [are American. ](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2021/07/01/cuba-is-facing-its-worst-shortage-of-food-since-the-1990s) This is because the embargo was modified in 2000, and allowed for the US to export food and medicine to Cuba. 

While Cuba can't sell cigars, rum or sugar to the US, their ability to get foreign currencies is not particularly diminished, given that they can freely trade with China and Europe, and they do. But they have a constant trade deficit, since they peg their currency too highly (1 peso to 1 dollar) which makes their exports incredibly expensive. Another way Cuba gets foreign exchange is through tourism. But Covid ravaged that industry, so the entry of foreign currencies through tourism became practically nil. Add to this that the elimination of the dual currency scheme meant taht Cubans could hold dollars freely, and this caused a massive capital flight (not really, but kinda), since Cubans held dollars instead of using them to buy food.

So the Cuban state faced a conoundrum in how to spend their foreign currency. Oil not sold at a premium price, or food and machinery. Either way, it means less food. On top of that, the Covid crisis, which made food prices skyrocket, and they needed to spend an even bigger chunk of their scarce currency buying food, which exacerbated the crisis. So Cuba was already in a crisis caused by poor macro policy, that was simply exacerbated by Covid.",baseballnomics,t2_c3keg5ax,0.88,269,81

> Vote YES on measure V to protect Mountain View from the biggest threat facing our community: skyrocketing rents!  Hard working families are losing their homes.  Valued teachers, nurses, and tech employees are leaving Mountain View as rents become unaffordable.

Correct, the increased cost of housing is a very huge issue for the entire bay area.  Unfortunately, rent control is a small bandaid placed on a gaping wound.  The real solution is more housing.  Rents depend on three things:

 - the amount of housing
 - the number of jobs
 - how much these jobs pay

Unless you want to reduce jobs or decrease salaries, the only way to decrease the cost of housing in the long term is by building more housing.

> To landlords who keep rents reasonable, thank you!  Vote YES on Measure V to stop opportunistic rent increases and unwarranted evictions by others.

Or we could build more housing so supply and demand doesn't allow the opportunity for massive rent increases.

> Measure V makes housing costs predictable and stable, freeing seniors and others from constant fear of losing their homes.

For existing tenants, it does make costs predictable and stable and reduces the fear of being evicted for not being able to afford rent, but can create strong incentive for landlords to find reasons to evict tenants who are paying far under market rate.  This can be seen in Ellis Act evictions in San Francisco.

> Rents have increased 54% since 2012.  Wages have not kept pace, putting profound stress on the community.  As we lose beloved family and community members, we lose Mountain View's qualify of life.

The city should really consider building a lot more housing.

> Vote YES on Measure V to protect over 14,000 renting households while still being fair to landlords:

Ok, let's see what your plan to be fair to landlords is.

> Allows rents to be raised 25% annually, depending on the rate of inflation (typically 23%)

Unfortunately, the proposition states that rent can't be raised more than the annual CPI increase.  This is dramatically different from allowing 25% rent increases and would fall well below the 54% increase in rents which the market has set since 2012.  This is a huge misrepresentation of what the rent control law would actually be.

> Allows larger rent increases for increased maintenance costs or property taxes or if a landlord skips a year

Under these conditions, rent increases are capped at 10% per year.  This is entirely reasonable, rent increases of 10% per year would allow rent controlled rates to quickly catch up to any increase in market rates.

> Limits evictions to specific situations (unpaid rent, illegal activity, etc), preventing evictions just to raise rents

The simplest way to prevent evictions just to raise rents is to not have rent control.

> Protects families too frightened to report unsafe conditions for fear of retaliatory evictions.

Fair enough, we aren't going to take the time to read the details of this in the proposed law.

> Exempts all units built after February 1, 1995, as well as singlefamily homes, duplexes, condos, and inlaw units, and all new housing (does not discourage growth).

Good.  Not having rent control on new units will encourage developers to build more housing.  Now all we need is for the city to approve the construction of more housing.

> Rolls back rents to October 2015 levels

Landlords will rationally raise rents in response to the threat of having their units rent controlled and this does prevent that.  Unfortunately, this removes a year of rent increases (during a period where rent increased 54% in 4 years) so that immediately puts rents at 5-10% below market rate instantly if the proposition passes.

Nothing unreasonable here.

The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.”

While I do agree that there are interesting philosophical questions about the sort of Protestant Ethic ""If a man will not work, he shall not eat"" kind of rationale espoused by some.  That said, I do not think there is some grand conspiracy to create ""meaningless jobs.""

In that vein, I present [this](http://singularityhub.com/2016/08/23/the-end-of-meaningless-jobs-will-unleash-the-worlds-creativity/) bit of nonsense posted over in our favorite badecon-generating machine: /r/Futurology.

Ultimately, the article's central claim is this: **productivity is hamstrung by meaningless jobs, and if only people would work less, productivity would increase exponentially.**

#Criticism 1: Costs Without Benefits (For Firms)

>In 1930, John Maynard Keynes predicted that automation would create a 15-hour work week for everyone in Britain and the United States. Graeber argues that we failed to live up to this prediction, not because of a failure of automation, but because of the fear of the social effects that would occur when large numbers of people had large amounts of unstructured time.

It's quite a bizarre claim that a grand social conspiracy is afoot to keep workers active while at the same time replacing them with automation, thus rendering them inactive.  

So let's talk about the logical inconsistency there.  We know from our principles of microeconomics courses that labor is an input, which makes it part of some firm's total cost function.  We also know that costs are minimized when the marginal benefit of adding one more unit of some input is equal to the marginal cost of that additional unit.  If MB>MC, then they're leaving potentially greater productivity on the table, if MC<MB, then they're incurring additional cost with no additional benefit.

The crux of the claim is the latter.  So I guess my question is this: **you mean to tell me that these worker-hating firms that are so hell-bent on squeezing costs as much as they can are actually creating meaningless jobs so they can WILLFULLY INCUR COSTS WITHOUT BENEFITS?**

#Criticism 2: Costs Without Benefits (for Workers)

Economics is all about the margins: what's the benefit of one extra...whatever?  Everyone makes choices at the margins: firms, workers, benevolent social planners, and feckless dictators (I'm looking at you, /u/Wumbotarian).  I talked about this briefly in my first criticism, mainly from the point of view of the firm, but let's look at the worker:

If you've taken an intermediate micro or labor course, you know that the [supply of labor curve is backward-bending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_bending_supply_curve_of_labour), a phenomenon reflecting the labor-leisure tradeoff along with the income and substitution effects.  Here's what I mean: in a very general sense, workers have a choice on whether to work (and earn) more while giving up leisure, or work (and earn) less while gaining leisure.  Whatever their choice, we can assume that most people are choosing (inasmuch as they can) the combination of work and leisure that works best for them.

>To date, a lot of people had only two options for work: income and dissatisfaction, or no income and freedom. Neither of these are particularly appealing.

>Larry Page offers a solution: “Work less,” which would certainly reduce the amount of time people spent on unsatisfactory jobs and provide more opportunities for people to pursue their true interests.

This is the suggestion the author of this article gives while at the same time bemoaning stagnant real wages.  ""Low wages are a problem!"" -> ""Hey, maybe you should work less.""

Ok, so we could assume that a worker's utility is only a function of labor and leisure, let's call them L_1 and L_2, so we have workers maximizing U(L_1,L_2) subject to some budget constraint L_1*wage≥budget.  We could set up the Lagrangian: ℒ(L_1,L_2,λ)=∇U(L_1,L_2)-λ∇Constraint and find first order and second order conditions, but it's much easier to just prax it out:

In general, people have a pretty good idea of what maximizes their own utility.  If most people COULD work less, they would, but the opportunity cost is too high.  Again, the author suggests increased cost without any increased benefit.

#Criticism 3: Obscuring some goodeconomics in a whole bunch of badeocnomics

That's right, there's some good(ish) economics in here:

>Automation certainly won’t mean the death of human work. In the best of all possible worlds, it will mean an end to work that is unfulfilling. For some, that would mean time spent creating and inventing, for others that might mean a lot of time spent playing with all those new creations and inventions, which is kind of the point.

That's what we've been saying all along, right?  Automation isn't a wanton job-killer, but rather it reallocates labor to where humans have the comparative advantage.  And sure, lots of that will involve creativity.  However, we are not slaves to ""meaningless jobs"" in the meantime.

And further, a little rant of my own: if you need to find personal meaning and fulfillment in what you DO rather than who you ARE, then it might be time to think a little less about economics and do a little soul-searching.  In the words of Tyler Durden:

>You are not your job, you're not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You are not your fucking khakis. You are all singing, all dancing crap of the world.",iamelben,t2_580t2,0.89,22,12
637,fmofol,2020-03-21,badeconomics,"Why* giving every American $1,200 is a really bad idea (*reasoning may not be included)","[Here is the full text of the article in question.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/20/heres-why-giving-every-american-1200-is-really-bad-idea/)

RI: The author makes... dubious assumptions about who is and isn't at risk from a total economic slowdown, with nice helpings of 'won't someone think of the poor businessowners?' Not sure if the R1 is supposed to be a summary or not, but if not, I've continued it paragraph by paragraph below.

>It is yet another sign of our political dysfunction that a government that dithered for weeks before getting serious about fighting a global pandemic now can’t take a few days for thoughtful debate about how to spend a trillion dollars to deal with the economic fallout.

Okay... full disclosure, I have been unhappy with this administration since it has existed, but 'responding too fast to the fastest economic slowdown anyone alive has ever seen' has not been one of my complaints. They're on the back foot already because they stupidly delayed quarantine and testing, and somehow the author has concluded from this that they should delay *more*, for little reason other than him personally disagreeing with them. Perhaps he will provide his reasoning further in the article (...don't hold your breath).

>Let’s just do a little simple arithmetic.

oh no

>There are about 330 million people living in the United States. About 75 million of those are children under the age of 18. There are about 10 million students who spend most of their time studying at colleges and universities. And there are 65 million Americans who live primarily off pensions and monthly checks from the Social Security Administration. Few of those 150 million children, students and seniors will lose much income as a result of layoffs and business closures caused by the pandemic.

There are... a lot of things wrong with this paragraph. For one, the idea that student incomes - likely to be tied to service industries that need to be shut down in quarantine - are somehow safer from losses in quarantine (that has *already* shut down universities and displaced students) is asserted as obvious and true by the author with literally no evidence. Secondly, Social Security requires a functioning economy to, itself, function - it's not an endless pot immune to total economic slowdown. Listing some of the country's most economically vulnerable demographics as being safe from effectively total economic slowdown is absurd enough by itself, but this gentleman has taken that one step further, and implied that children, who have, by-and-large, zero income, are thus safe from income losses. Technically, yes, I suppose that an unemployed child can't lose a job or income they do not have - but the tax code does call these diminutive economic freeloaders 'dependents' for a reason.

>In addition, there are, by my count, roughly 100 million workers who are likely to continue to receive most of their normal wage and salary income either because they will continue to show up for work, or work from home, or be paid even though they are not working.

The author's 'count' is, of course, completely unsourced. He's pulled 'roughly' 100 million quarantine-proof workers 'roughly' from his... exactly the orifice you're thinking of. How will 2/3rds of the 'roughly' 150 million jobs in the US 'continue to receive most of their normal wage and salary income'? Perhaps they can pull their unprecedented-quarantine-proof-salaries from the same place this author got all 100 million of *them*.

>This 100 million includes about 33 million government workers and public school teachers who will continue to be paid. It includes 3 million farmers who will continue to produce our food, 1 million people involved in processing and distributing that food and 3 million workers at grocery and beverage stores who will sell it. And it includes the 3 million people working for information technology, Internet and telecommunications companies that will keep us all wired up and entertained, the 9 million working in finance and the 10 million in law, accounting, consulting and other professional firms, most of whom are already working at home.

Public school teachers *are* government workers, but more to the point here, their salaries and whether or not they 'will continue to get paid' as this so confidently asserts is not a decision made at a federal level - it's made at a state level, as with *many, many* government workers. This is largely dependent on state educational budgets, and at a federal level the hostility Betsy DeVos has for giving anything other than middle fingers to public schools does not instill me with confidence that all public education staff will continue to get paid. 33 million government workers, 3 million farmers, 1 million food distributors, 3 million grocery retail workers, 3 million tech industry workers, 9 million finance workers, and 10 million legal workers, using Simple Math^(tm), adds up to a whopping 62 million. Not only is he short his 100 million worker figure, he's also getting that 62 million figure from a base assumption of no mass layoffs (or even slowdowns - these are current figures, not taking quarantines into account) in every single industry he mentions - to say nothing of the possibility of any of these workers, y'know, actually getting sick.

>Let’s not forget the millions of workers who will be kept on the payrolls in the airline, cruise line, hotel and hospitality industries as a result of a $150 billion federal rescue package and millions more at smaller firms that will continue to meet payroll, thanks to $300 billion in loans from the Small Business Administration.

Even if we took the absurd leap of assuming that this rescue package and these loans will directly result in the maintenance of tourism industry payrolls, that still would not guarantee that all 'millions' (didn't even bother with a fantasy number, I'm disappointed) of said payrolls *can* be maintained that way, especially for as long as tourism is likely to be crippled by this pandemic. 

>That leaves about 80 million Americans whose income may be in jeopardy. To be sure, that’s a lot of workers needing help and a big hit to the economy. But those are not challenges best met by sending $1,200 checks to 250 million of their fellow citizens who are still getting paychecks and can’t even spend what they make — they can’t go shopping, or take a vacation or even go out for a nice dinner.

Can't go shopping? Nonsense, the grocery retailers, food distributors, and farmers are still fully paying their workers those wages that said workers didn't lose, remember? That means they're either still operational... or they're being used as dubiously necessary middlemen for the distribution of government aid, and not actually adding any value or function to the economy. How much of everyday American incomes does this guy think *isn't* going to essentials? Are they spending it all on that damn avocado toast?

>The better strategy is to get money into the hands of cash-strapped businesses that promise to use it to keep workers on their payrolls — or, if that fails, to get it into the hands of laid off workers who will probably spend it on essentials.

These are both massive assumptions to make, and the former has already been tried and largely failed the most at-risk people (people working retail or service jobs, especially as 'gig' or part-time work that is already subject to high turnover and volatility) in the years since 2008. Businesses *promising* 'to use [the money] to keep workers on their payrolls' in no way guarantees that they will *actually* keep workers on their payrolls. As for the spending part, what is it that you expect the 'not laid off officially but still economically vulnerable' people to spend the 'very bad idea' $1,200 on? If they spend it somewhere at all, it means that money is once again moving through the economy via potentially taxable transactions that would not have happened in the absence of the money. If they hoard it... wouldn't the economy be unaffected by it, by definition? The only one losing out there is the government itself. I find it interesting in a disturbing sense that this author's first priority is to businesses, and then *if that fails,* the laid off workers. If the businesses survive and some workers still get laid off, I wonder, would he conclude success or failure? In the former case, would the laid off workers be ignored and left to fend for themselves, and in the latter, would a sunk-cost fallacy merely result in doubling down on aid to businesses? How much and what kind of failure is necessary for this type of economic stimulus to *actually* get to the laid off workers? These are all questions that, naturally, he does not even attempt to answer.

>As an alternative, if the government were to send those 80 million laid off workers a $500 check (tax free) every week for eight weeks, that would be $4,000 apiece — enough to keep their collective spending somewhere close to where it is now. And at $320 billion, that would be significantly less than the White House and Republican Senate leaders propose to spend.

Spending less is not always better, austerity in a crisis is not necessarily a good idea. Ultimately, this is a philosophical question, not an economic one, though divorcing the economic reality from the philosophical implications of it is impossible - it depends heavily on how you think aid *should* be distributed, and that's ultimately subjective. Boiled down, it's a 2-dimensional spectrum of choices with 4 extremes - the first being helping as few people as possible as little as possible in order to spend as little as possible and minimize the risk of accidentally helping those who don't need it, the second being helping as few people as possible as much as possible to avoid 'accidental' help but attempt to maximize the help's effectiveness, the third being helping as many as possible as little as possible to minimize the risk of not helping those who do need it and minimize cost even if some help might be insufficient, and the last being to help as many as possible as much as possible, risking providing more aid than is necessary to more people than is necessary, and increasing the risk of overextension of resources. Answering that philosophical question for any systemic aid is necessary, but unfortunately it's possible to answer from one extreme without even realizing there are other options, or even realizing the question is asked implicitly by *any* decision of which economic aid policy to support.

>The only reason this foolish proposal is under serious consideration is that it was cooked up in secret over the weekend by politicians spooked by the rout on the stock market, worried about losing the next election and desperate to show they are doing something “big” other than bailing out private industries. There was no serious analysis done by professionals at the White House, Treasury or the Congressional Budget Office, no input from congressional committees, no consultation with Democrats and certainly no public debate.

This isn't economics, it's a political diatribe with a touch of conspiracy (for flavor, I guess). Also, no public debate? How in the hell am I reading your opinions that you posted on it, then?

>Now we are told by some who ought to know better that if Congress fails to throw a trillion dollars at the problem in the next few days, tens of millions of sales clerks and restaurant waiters and Uber drivers will go hungry, get thrown out of their homes and lose their Internet access, and economic Armageddon will be upon us.

Why ought they 'know better'? He, as per his habit so far, provides no evidenced rationale. Well, apart from his implication that anyone who disagrees with his opinion on the matter is wrong and stupid, and credit where credit is due, he provides a *ton* of evidence that he feels that way. A pity he can't seem to properly explain why.

>“Give Every American $2,000, Immediately,” demanded the very serious people at the New York Times in Thursday’s lead editorial, a mishmash of economic nonsense, liberal grievances and Democratic talking points.

This isn't economics, it's a political diatribe dripping with... vitriol. I guess the conspiracy seasoning from before wasn't quite flavorful enough.

>We need to stop for a moment and take a deep breath. This is a scary time. A lot has happened in the past three weeks. People are dying. Panic has overtaken financial markets. Countries are locking down their citizens and closing their borders. The global economy is tumbling into recession. Governments need to pull people together, act boldly and lend and spend freely.

Yeah, that's exactl-... wait, *what*?

>Freely, but not stupidly. The right antidote for not doing any of the right things for too long is not to do too much of the wrong thing too fast. Sending money to millions of voters who don’t need it and can’t spend it may be good politics, but its[sic] lousy economics.

Assuming the freemarket could come up with a more productive employee then it would maximize when that person is the most ""productive"".


So, **the big question**: are welfare programs a *subsidy* for employers in any meaningful economic sense? Let's investigate. 

First, we need to agree on what a subsidy for employers is. I say that a subsidy for employers is any payment from the government that either a) is received by employers as an increasing function of their number of employee hours, or that b) is a payment to workers or potential workers that causes wages to fall.  

So, are welfare programs subsidies for employers? Let's consider a couple of different welfare program designs and answer the question for each one. I suspect a splash of basic theory is largely all we'll need for each. Note: real welfare programs can draw upon elements from more than 1 type I list below, so bear in mind I'm not giving you a full on partition here.

**Welfare program type 1**: programs offered to people with low incomes which then phase out gradually (ie, without a cliff). Example programs include SNAP, arguably social security, and (for part of its schedule) the EITC.

For programs that gradually phase out benefits as income increases, within that phase out range, these programs encourage people to reduce their labor supply by effectively raising the marginal tax rate phased by the people receiving them. To the extent that people respond to these incentives, we would expect people to work fewer hours and for employers to bear some of the incidence of this marginal tax rate hike in the form of increased wages. 

**Verdict**: these are not employer subsidies.

**Welfare program type 2**: programs offered to people with low incomes that then disappear entirely after some threshold income (a cliff). Mainly, this is Medicaid, but we can also include old timey welfare (AFDC) and the like. 

This is tricky. Obviously, the cliffs create work disincentives, but the effect on wages is going to depend on annoying parameters like what the distribution of workers relative to the cliff would be without the program and the degree to which workers can adjust their intensive margin labor supplies (their number of hours worked given they work at all). Instead of thinking about theory-with-cliffs and being sad (I leave that exercise to the reader), here's some empirical evidence that Medicaid apparently doesn't put downward pressure on wages in general:  [1](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22540)  [2](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22118.pdf)

**Verdict**: these are not employer subsidies.

**Welfare program type 3**: programs offered to people with low incomes that have a work requirement of some sort. Example programs include the EITC and (depending on the state) TANF, Medicaid (per a very recent policy), and other programs.
 
When programs have work requirements they serve as extensive margin employment subsidies (that is, they provide a subsidy to you if you choose to work, period) and when benefits increase in hours worked (as in part of the EITC schedule) they also subsidize the intensive margin of employment (how many hours you work). Barring unrealistic labor supply and labor demand elasticities, you should expect the incidence of these subsidies to fall partly on the worker and partly on the employer, in the form of reduced wages. Indeed, this effect has been confirmed at least for the EITC by [Rothstein](http://www.nber.org/papers/w14966). I'm not aware of evidence on the effect of work requirements for TANF and what not on wages, though, so take that part with a grain of salt.

**Verdict**: these are employer subsidies, with the caveat that I am aware of little evidence to confirm the theoretical prediction about work requirements.

**Welfare program type 4**: programs that require you to be unemployed, such as unemployment insurance. 

These programs create incentives to remain unemployed and so raise the opportunity cost of work, discouraging employment on the intensive margin (do I get a job?) but not on the extensive margin (how many hours should I work?). In a good ol fashioned supply and demand model of the labor market, this is a negative labor supply shock that pushes up wages. In a search and matching model, this increases workers' outside option to employment, thus increasing their threat point in negotiations and allowing them to command higher wages (while increasing unemployment). In any case, there is upward pressure on wages.

**Verdict**: these are not employer subsidies.

**Welfare program type 5**: programs that are universal (or targeted based on some characteristic people cannot manipulate). Examples include Medicare and the Alaska permanent fund.

This is a bit trickier than the above policies, seeing as these programs are not a function of income at all. I would point out, however, that if utility is concave in income, in a search and matching model, these universal programs can notably improve the threat point for really broke people since, well, u(ubi+salary) - u(ubi) < u(salary) - u(0). That suggests the availability of these programs improve worker bargaining power and put upward pressure on wages. Also, Medicare is a special case here since problems with health insurance markets make it difficult to buy decent insurance in the individual market, generating substantial bargaining power for firms --- Medicare takes that away.  

**Verdict**: these are not employer subsidies.

Welfare program type 6: direct subsidies paid to employers, as found in various active labor market programs that include payments for hiring various types of workers (eg, the formerly long term unemployed) or in sweet heart deals made between politicians and favored industries (eg, coal mining). 

**Verdict**: these are employer subsidies.


**What have we learned from all of the above?** We've learned that welfare programs do not in general constitute employer subsidies. Rather, welfare programs only function as employer subsidies when they **a)** literally include an employer subsidy, **b)** offer benefits that *increase* in income, or **c)** feature work requirements (probably - put less certainty on point c when you update your priors).

As a side note, ironically enough, OP is (accidentally) right about minimum wage increases reducing the extent to which welfare programs function as subsidies -- at least in the case of the EITC, per Rothstein, min wage hikes really do have that effect!

I would also like to acknowledge that my RI is in some sense intentionally missing **OP's moral point**. When people complain about employer ""subsidies"" I think they often don't mean anything in particular in terms of having their words correspond with facts and reality. Rather, they intend a moral point and have a ""moral economy"" model of sorts in mind where employers have an obligation to guarantee that their employees meet some minimum living standard and that welfare programs ""subsidize"" them in some sort of moral sense in that the welfare programs are helping to get their employees past that minimum living standard. By using the term ""subsidy"" to point out that it is a government program doing this rather than the employers, folks are just pointing out that employers may not have legitimately fulfilled their moral obligations since they did not get their employees' minimum living standard up to par on their own. 

I think this is a fine enough point to make morally and am highly sympathetic to it, but I believe it should be made clearly and on its own terms, rather than by mixing positive and normative statements into a cocktail where they blend together and no longer can be distinguished. Moreover, slapping a moral parity onto the term subsidy is probably not a good idea: there are plenty of things we should be comfortable with that are subsidies (eg, the EITC seems to have all around great consequences) and I'm not sure anyone is better served by turning the word ""subsidy"" into a slur.

Politics has been dominated by culture wars and the personality of Donald Trump: economic policy has become increasingly absent. And where there is no economics at all, how can we find bad economics? Are the golden days of Ron Paul and his ilk never to be seen again?

Fear not my friends, for we have been given unto us a messiah. His name is RFK Jr and he's running for president. 

Probably, you're already familiar with him because of his various conspiracy views. For those not aware, he runs a [crank medical organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Health_Defense) that's worried about vaccines and fluoride and all that jazz. His organization [seems to think](https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/7/142) that the covid vaccine contains tracking chips with cryptocurrency features that will enable the Fed to do something or other with digital dollars. He's worried about 5g and [iPhone radiation](https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1702798352763818136) and how it all interacts with vaccines. Where you read ""covid"" he reads ""[\(\(\(covid\)\)\)](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/15/us/politics/rfk-jr-remarks-covid.html)"".

You get the picture. But we're not here for that. We're here for economic policy. What's he got in the tank for *that*?

Well, he's running for president. Might as well start with his economic platform. Because baby, [he's got a 14 point plan](https://www.kennedy24.com/economy)! I wonder if he chose 14 on purpose. I digress.

The shining highlight of this list is this thing of beauty right here:

> Drop housing costs by $1000 per family and make home ownership affordable by backing 3% home mortgages with tax-free bonds.

He [likes to talk about this one on twitter](https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1707799442420887835) as well. Ain't it a doozy? The RI for this is actually already available, [sitting on the shelf](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/126r84u/just_subsidize_demand/). 

In fairness, he apparently [does want to legalize ADUs](https://www.kennedy24.com/housing). So I guess things could be worse. But I'd argue that the upshot of legalizing ADUs is offset by this ominous business on that page about trying to engineer the tax code to prevent corporations from buying single family homes. 

What else do we have in this platform? Oddly, it's not all bad (not that we are here to look at the bright spots). I'd say the home mortgage thing is probably at the frontier of (bad economics, novel and interesting). There are worse policies in there, of course, but mostly we've seen it all before. Bog standard protectionism, basically. For example, *Cut energy prices by restricting natural gas exports.* Or: *Negotiate trade deals that prevent low-wage countries from competing with American workers in a “race to the bottom.”* And: *Secure the border and bring illegal immigration to a halt.*

You get the picture. He also blends some of his crankery into the platform. He has something about establishing ""addiction healing centers on organic farms"" and about expanding access to ""low-cost alternative and holistic therapies"" in the healthcare system. 

In terms of other content in his platform, I'll cover a few minor highlights. Everything that follows is from the economy page of his website, unless an additional link is given:

> Support small businesses by redirecting regulatory scrutiny onto large corporations. [[...](https://www.kennedy24.com/revitalization)] We will enact policies that favor small and medium businesses, which are the nation’s real job creators and the dynamos of American enterprise.

This 'small is beautiful' mindset really seems to infect a lot of people. But it's not clear we really should want to favor them.

For one, it doesn't really seem to be true that small and medium businesses are the nation's ""real job creators"". It's based on a long standing misconception: it's not really business size that seems to matter for job creation, but rather [business age](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c13492/revisions/c13492.rev4.pdf). Basically, new companies tend to grow like gangbusters or go bankrupt. Young startups with lots of job creation in their future do start small - hence you might mistakenly thing it's size, not age, that matters. But once a small business gets to be a little long in the tooth, to a first approximation, it doesn't have much job creation in its future. 

For two, mom and pop shops kind of suck to work at. Big companies are large and efficient. They often are more productive and better managed than mom and pop shops. [They pay better](https://www.nber.org/papers/w20313). Mom and pop shops are also notorious for being worse when it comes to minimum wage compliance to workplace safety rules to workplace harassment. Big companies know they're a target large enough to be worth suing or pursuing enforcement actions against, and have institutions within them dedicated to handling those issues. Small businesses generally aren't big enough to be worth targeting and generally don't have such institutions. Moreover, if you run your own micro business, you have some folks that just like running them as petty tyrants. So it really isn't clear to me that we should particularly promotes small businesses over large businesses. And promoting them by loosening regulatory scrutiny of them even further is a bit perverse.

As for the final ""dynamos of American enterprise"" remark. You could interpret this many ways. I would just note that it seems unlikely that small firms would be all that good at innovation and R&D outside of certain special cases.

> Expand free childcare to millions of families.

Not much to say here beyond: good luck finding the labor without immigration or gains from trade with low wage countries.


> Make student debt dischargeable in bankruptcy and cut interest rates on student loans to zero.

This is a fun one, because assessing it is impossible without understanding the intent of the policy. I have heard schemes to make student debt dischargeable in bankruptcy, but to transfer the debt back to the university or college if that happens. I actually think that's not a terrible idea, provided it's implemented intelligently, and would push us toward an equilibrium where schools are less keen to enroll people in negative return degrees. On the other hand, if they skip the university liability part, this would just turn out to be free college through the backdoor, so, not so genius.

> Cut drug costs by half to bring them in line with other nations.

When other people propose this kind of thing, I generally imagine that they just aren't thinking about possible impacts on pharmaceutical research and development. But in RFK's case, I suppose that may be the point. If I thought pharmaceutical R&D was mainly focused on manufacturing mind control devices and new autism delivery mechanisms, I guess I would want to tamp down on it as well...


>People always ask, “How are we going to pay for all this?” The answer is simple. First is to end the military adventures and regime-change wars, like the one in Ukraine. The wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Libya already cost us over $8 trillion. That’s $90,000 per family of four. That’s enough to pay off all medical debt, all credit card debt, provide free childcare, feed every hungry child, repair our infrastructure, and make college tuition free – with money left over. That’s enough to make social security solvent for another 30 years. 


This is another great one. He'll fund his various schemes by spending the sunk costs from W Bush's wars? Genius stuff. I suppose we could cut off Ukraine; if we did that upfront, we'd have saved [all of 75 billion dollars](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-aid-has-us-sent-ukraine-here-are-six-charts), much of the value of which was in the form of in kind transfers in aging equipment. I'm sure that'll go real far. (If we were r/badgeopolitics, I'd have more yet to say about. But alas.) 


> *[Continuing the pay-for discussion.]* Second is to end the corruption in Washington, the corporate giveaways, the boondoggles, the bailouts of the too-big-to-fail that leave the little guy at the mercy of the market. Corporations right now are sitting on $8 trillion in cash. Their contribution to tax revenues was 33% in the 1950s – it is 10% today. It’s high time they paid their fair share. 

The too big to fail bailouts! Normie hatred of our efforts to save us from a second great depression in 2008 will never burn out, will it? I guess you can read this as wanting to triple the corporate tax rate as well. Nothing like some good ol fashioned double marginalization to close your budget holes.

At any rate, I think it's clear that Mr. Kennedy has potential. This little platform of his is a nice starting point. And there is plenty of reason to hope for me. Like I said, he's running and it doesn't look like he's likely to slink away anytime soon. And he isn't shy about broaching various policies issues on his twitter, in his own way. You only get breadcrumbs, really, but you get occasional gems, like his plan to ban fracking to [discourage plastics production](https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1702705913076019352). And you get some classic treats: for example, he reads [zerohedge on inflation](https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1695127888809328953).

640,9p2ssz,2018-10-17,badeconomics,"Jean-Marc Jancovici, energy elasticity and consumption causality","In France, we have ~~a physicist~~ an engineer named [Jean-Marc
Jancovici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Marc_Jancovici), who's an expert
about everything surrounding climate and energy questions. He's a *very good*
popularizer, he frequently appears on TV to dispell common myths around energy
(like how [investing in renewable energies doesn't reduce our carbon footprint
since our energy supply is mainly nuclear, so it's a waste of
money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQeO_d0PTEo)). (Oh, yeah, this R1 will
probably be full of links in french, sorry. This sub is too americentric, let's bring in more diversity.) For
all these reasons, I really like him, because he's exactly the kind of
pragmatist that we need to deal with this huge issue, people who have a deep
knowledge of the advantages and drawbacks of the different energy sources, to
help us lower our carbon emissions.

But there's a problem with Jancovici. He's not an economist, but he frequently
*talks* about economics. Which wouldn't be a problem in itself if most of what he
said wasn't on the edge of *batshit insane*. It really undermines his whole
(otherwise very good) discourse, in my opinion.

Now, I'm nowhere near an expert in this field, but he's not either, so I think
it's fair game that I try to R1 some of the stuff he recently said.

Anyway, here's a recent talk from him (in English!):
[Can we save energy, jobs and growth at the same time ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGt4XwBbCvA).
This talk contains all the arguments that Jancovici makes about economics, so
I'll use that as the main subject of the R1.

> [18:19] If you pump, you get oil. It happens that all this process of going
> from ocean microorganisms to an oil field is free. Nobody paid a single cent

Jancovici is talking about the externalities of non-renewable consumption here,
which is good economics. While you could argue that it is not impossible to
correct the externality of depleting a finite stock of resources, it's not
really done anywhere, and the major price influence is the cost of resource
extraction. This is indeed a major problem, although more of a political one than
a problem with ""the economic system"".

> [30:30] The two productive factors are human capital and human work, and if
> we have these two factors, the supermarket is full of things to buy.

Since Jancovici is using this model to talk about GDP later, it's really a bad
idea to talk only about material goods, because the GDP also contains services,
which don't necessarily require a significant amount of energy (like a doctor
visit, or seeing a play), but okay.

Next, he [shows a simplified version](https://i.imgur.com/Z4UR02n.png) of the
model proposed in the Meadows report ""Limits to Growth"" (that [Solow
called](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/interview-with-robert-solow)
“amateurs making absurd statements about economics” [and doing] “amateur dynamics
without a license, without a proper qualification”) in order to show that
reducing the amount of energy and natural resources reduces the amount of
material goods of the market. I guess this assumes a constant energy/resource
efficiency of the ""productive system"", which Jancovici never mentions, but
I get the general point.

Here, he's [showing a regression](https://i.imgur.com/YnzVwHI.png) on [energy
elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_elasticity). This is a very
important point to discuss, but the underlying implication is completely
misleading. He seems to be saying that the elasticity is constant across all
countries. While the elasticity is certainly high for developing countries, it
is certainly not the case in developed economies (Jakob, Haller, Marschinski
2012). Anyway, this elasticity on the global scale is still concerning, so we
can kind of get behind the question.

Side note: 39:33 this is one of the [worst
visualizations](https://i.imgur.com/xasogZO.png) I have ever seen in
my academic life.

Then, he proceeds to painstakingly explain why a decrease in energy will lower
the quantity of material goods, while still completely dismissing the
energy efficiency of the productive system, and the fact that GDP isn't only
about material goods produced. And now, this is where the batshit insane part
begins.

But that metric doesn't make sense in the long run! If the productivity of the
system changes with time, the labor/leisure trade-off equilibrium will decrease,
so obviously this curve will show a long term downward slope. And that's not
even accounting for population aging, for a country that is well past its
demographic transition. Looking at the [total number of hours
worked in Spain](https://data.oecd.org/chart/5lak) isn't conclusive but should
give you a clue of how wrong your metric is.

^(EDIT: rereading that, it probably wasn't a good idea to use a metric that includes unemployment to talk about disparities in unemployment metrics, but you get the point)

> [45:49] So there is a very simple way to decrease the rate of unemployment,

Well, that's a good thing right? More leisure for everyone, yeee! How does that
make the metric of the thing you're talking about bad? Also, if that's the main
driver behind the disparity with the actual unemployment curve you're talking
about, then surely that means productivity is *increasing*, right? Since labor
demand fell enough to decrease the labor/leisure trade-off equilibrium, we
produce more with the same amount of work. So why is your story telling the
exact opposite?

Okay, first, you're still doing a regression on the energy *consumption* and
not the energy *availability*. And this is where this talk is becoming a real
trainwreck.

**Jancovici is inverting causality and assumes that GDP is decreasing because
of the lower energy availability, instead of realizing that the energy
consumption decreased BECAUSE of the GDP decrease**. Yeah, you know, after the
fucking [2007-2008 financial
crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008)?

The whole idea of the previous points Jancovici made was that there was a high
elasticity between GDP and energy use. And yeah, in the current state of things
that may very well be right. Energy use is a good indicator of economic
activity (at least the derivatives are), even in developed economies (see
Arora, Lieskovsky 2014 for instance). Instead of using that fact to show that
energy use declined after the crisis, Jancovici is trying to **explain the
financial crisis by a decline in energy availability**.

This is such a horrid causation error. OF COURSE when economic activity goes down, energy use and
jobs go down, why do you have to twist causality in the weirdest way possible?

Also, why are you insisting on the fact that GDP can't go up without the energy
going up, when the graph you put under our noses shows exactly the opposite? I
mean, maybe it's more obvious when you show it [properly represented as a
function of
time](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.COMM.GD.PP.KD?locations=DE-GB-FR-US-ES&name)
but obviously that kinda undermines your whole point because it shows how full
of shit your assumptions are: intensive growth makes energy efficiency
increase, so the energy elasticity *decreases*. (And yeah, I know embedded energy is a thing, but it's not like you can't measure the value of imports).

It seems that Jancovici makes the same causality error in almost every work he
publishes about this issue, see for instance [this google translated article on
his
blog](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fjancovici.com%2Ftransition-energetique%2Fchoix-de-societe%2Flitalie-et-lenergie-un-cas-decole%2F&edit-text=&act=url)
where you can see [this wonderful
graph](https://jancovici.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/italy-energy-GDP.jpg),
and an explanation as to why the causality goes in this way:

> And we see that when the rate of growth of energy falls, the change in GDP
> generally follows from one to two years, which gives credence to the idea
> that when it is the energy that is constrained the GDP is forced to be so as

As [doubtful of a methodology](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cell_phones.png)
that is (show me your damn regression), this is not what the graph shows at all. Heck, I can find *more*
variation points on the graph where the shock seems to happen to the GDP before
the energy consumption.

Anyway, then Jancovici proceeds to show the same graphs for Greece (48:10) and
Portugal (48:30), goes on a rant about climate change, fossil fuels and
renewables not being efficient in terms of capital investment compared to
nuclear (which is good! He should do more of those.), then shows a completely
arbitrarily sliced graph (53:59) without providing a convincing regression to
show that somehow the oil shocks provoked the decline of annual growth, without
ever showing the actual oil supply or mentioning the fact that the EU economy
is slowly pivoting towards intensive growth and away from extensive growth, because of
the [decline in population
growth](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.GROW?locations=EU).

And now (56:06) comes the best demonstration of the talk.

> Jobs = Jobs. I divide and multiply the Jobs by the GDP. [...] I have created
> an indicator which is how many jobs can I put into one unit of GDP. [...] If

What does that even *mean*? If you increase wages by some exogenous process, you
grow the economy by that factor (well, [to some extent](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/3cp9vu/longrun_growth_is_the_keynesian_cross/)).

> So the less money people earn for a given GDP, the larger number of jobs I

At that point of the talk I'm not sure how Jancovici is able to talk about
market power in the labour market using an equation that boils down to 1 = 1 in
one of the most prestigious schools of France without anyone in the audience
throwing a pair of shoes at him, but anyway.

You might think that some of those terms simplify to give something
interesting, but no, it just [sinks into more
insanity](https://i.imgur.com/AJ2B7AI.png).

The end of the talk is about climate change, and while he makes a lot of bad
assumptions about the constancy of energy elasticity, never mentions that growth
is correlated to energy efficiency improvement and seems to generally imply that
growth is killing the planet, he's not entirely wrong that the elasticity is a

These threads are always the worst since people invariably try to argue for their politics norms with economics. The Guardian article insinuates that blue-collar labor represents the ""real wealth creators"" while the ""captains of industry"" do not. I don't know what this means, but they keep their claim fairly weak and I don't mind a little leftist rhetoric here and there, but one comment in particular is guilty of ignorance in the first degree.

>Corollary: Investors do not create jobs,only customers create jobs.

Even if workers were the ""real wealth creators,"" how does this imply that investors are irrelevant to production? Has capital been left in the production function all this time by mistake? (Someone pointed this out and is currently at -1)

Now I understand that this person is aligned with poorer people and decided to equate workers with consumers and celebrate them both, but unknowingly, he absolves the investor-executive class from any responsibility in Recessions. If good investment cannot create jobs, then bad investment cannot cause financial recessions and destroy jobs.

This article lays out a ""beginner's guide to MMT"".  I know we're tired of MMT but here is a great resource for people to use to understand MMT before criticizing them (if you think there are criticisms to be made).

RI:

>A good place to start is with a simple description that you can carry in your pocket: MMT proposes that a country with its own currency, such as the U.S., doesn’t have to worry about accumulating too much debt because it can always print more money to pay interest. So the only constraint on spending is inflation, which can break out if the public and private sectors spend too much at the same time. As long as there are enough workers and equipment to meet growing demand without igniting inflation, the government can spend what it needs to maintain employment and achieve goals such as halting climate change.

There is so much to unpack in the first paragraph (following the first through throat clearing paragraphs).  So many assumptions that aren't written out to fully vet and see if they're reasonable assumptions (perhaps because we lack a model?).  

>MMT proposes that a country with its own currency, such as the U.S., doesn’t have to worry about accumulating too much debt because it can always print more money to pay interest.

""Doesn't have to worry"".  What does this mean? What, in MMT's minds, are the relevant tradeoffs, the relevant welfare considerations, of having high deficits?  This is not clear, aside from the inflation consideration.

Debt is raised from capital markets from investors.  The government auctions bonds and takes money out of capital markets.  That means government debt ""crowds out"" private investment.  Is this something we don't need to worry about?

>So the only constraint on spending is inflation, which can break out if the public and private sectors spend too much at the same time.

This isn't really a ""constraint"", but rather a policy consideration. They're proposing a dual mandate, more-or-less.  This illuminates one of the tradeoffs they think matter.

You can't R1 normative positions, but this is still an important thing to understand.

>As long as there are enough workers and equipment to meet growing demand without igniting inflation, the government can spend what it needs to maintain employment and achieve goals 

This, I think, is where we can unpack the MMT model, which is badeconomics.  It is badeconomics because it assumes that money is non-neutral.

This is my parsimonious model:

https://imgur.com/tKHI3uX

Seignorage financed deficit spending increases aggregate demand.  The objective of government policy is to regulate aggregate demand such that AD2 = AS at Y\*, as the free market (Y = Laissez-faire) will be perpetually below potential.  Y\* is potential output, which is where full employment exists.  Inflation (higher price level) occurs here because too much money is chasing too few goods.

Deficit spending increasing aggregate demand is normal in AD/AS comparative statics.  However, what is different here is the implicit belief behind seignorage: money printing doesn't cause inflation.  Money neutrality states that printing money cannot move around real resources (shifting AD to where AD = Y\*) in the long run, it only increases nominal prices.  

MMT would be *correct* if money neutrality was wrong.  However, strong theory as well as strong evidence in the international cross-section suggests that money neutrality is an accurate description of reality.  This makes MMT wrong, and makes it badeconomics.

>On March 13 the University of Chicago Booth School of Business published a [survey of prominent economists](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/modern-monetary-theory) that misrepresented MMT that way, leaving out its understanding that too-big deficits can cause excessive inflation. The surveyed professors roundly disagreed with MMT as described. MMTers cried foul.

Going back to my parsimonious model, it relies on question 2 of the survey: *""Countries that borrow in their own currency can finance as much real government spending as they want by creating money.""*  This is the heart of MMT, not ""deficits don't matter"".  While there are many great responses to this question, Darrell Duffie wrote the best response:

>If this were true, each such country could finance the purchase of all of the world's output, which is obviously impossible.

Real government spending cannot be financed through seignorage forever; it manifests itself in higher inflation not increased material wealth.

If MMT can show that money printing does *not* lead to higher inflation, then MMT would have a leg to stand on.

Going back a bit:

>the government can spend what it needs to maintain employment 

Another argument made by MMTers is that a lassiez-faire economy will not employ everyone who wants a job.  They argue that a ""natural unemployment rate"" (defined as the unemployment rate at which there exists only frictional unemployment caused by things like job search) isn't real. If the government doesn't step in to employ people, then there will be a persistent gap between potential and actual output, which means we'll be persistently poorer as a society.  I don't think that MMTers have a grasp on how economists think about labor markets; that being said I have a rudimentary understanding of labor markets and won't go further here.

>MMT rejects the modern consensus that economies should be steered primarily by the raising and lowering of interest rates. MMTers believe that the natural rate of interest in a world of fiat money is zero and that pegging it higher is a giveaway to the investor class.

There is no definition of the natural interest rate provided.  It would be helpful if MMTers wrote down what they mean by the natural rate.  I will use ""natural rate"" to mean ""the rate of interest which arises when loanable funds/capital markets clear"".  The natural interest rate is an equilibrium price.  Going back, MMT argues that money is non-neutral.  If money is non-neutral the government *can* peg interest rates to zero.  We know - both empirically and through *super intuitive theory* - that money is non-neutral.  Friedman (1968) goes over why you can't peg interest rates at zero as higher rates manifest themselves through the Fisher Effect.  High interest rates tends to coincide with high inflation (Mishkin 1992).

Why is it the case that MMTers think that we should peg the interest rate at zero?  Do they see that returns to capital investment is pure rents?  ""The investor class"" is a vague and ambiguous concept; if you own a savings account, then the interest rate impacts your savings account returns - does this make you the equivalent of some evil fat cat Wall Street person?

>They say tweaking interest rates is ineffectual because businesses make investment decisions based on prospects for growth, not the cost of money.

This is mindboggling bad economic theory.  Firms will execute projects where the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost.  The Net Present Value (benefit) of a project is increasing in cash flows (""prospects for growth"") and decreasing in the discount (interest) rate.  Furthermore, this argument displays a lack of thinking on the margin.  Lastly, interest rates are not the price (cost) of money.  The price of money is 1/Price Level.  The interest rate is the price of loanable funds/capital.

>MMTers argue that economies should be guided by fiscal policy—government spending and taxation. They want a nation’s central bank to do the bidding of its treasury. So when the treasury needs money, the central bank accommodates it with a keystroke—creating base money from thin air by crediting the treasury’s checking account. The new textbook says that today, governments “tend to run unduly restrictive fiscal policy stances so as not to contradict the monetary policy stance.”

As I've said before, MMT is not a new paradigm of macroeconomic thought.  It is a collection of Old Keynesian policy prescriptions, and here is a prime example of that plain and simple.  In reality governments spend and the Fed reacts (conventional economic thought).  The actions are near simultaneous so it looks as if the fiscal authority is subservient to the Fed but this isn't true.  An example is the Tax Cut and Jobs Act that Trump and Republicans passed recently.  The fiscal authority instituted a large deficit financed tax cut, and the Fed reacted by raising rates.

>MMT challenges a core principle of conventional economics, which is that an increase in budget deficits will tend to raise interest rates, all else equal.

There are a few ways to connect increased deficits and increased interest rates.  The one channel is where capital markets charge higher interest rates at bond auctions when the government (which represents the demand side of the market) wants to buy a lot of capital (sell a lot of bonds).  Cet. par., higher demand means higher prices and interest rates are the price of capital/loanable funds (see above).  Alternatively, higher deficits cause higher demand and the Fed reacts to increased demand by raising rates to keep inflation on target (assuming more deficit spending puts us on a trajectory to higher inflation anyway).

>In MMT’s ideal world there would still be taxes, but their main purpose, aside from lessening inequality, would be as “offsets” to keep inflation under control. Taxes would drain just enough money from consumers and businesses so total spending in the economy won’t be excessive.

Notably missing from this suggestion is an analysis of optimal taxes.  Apparently incentives or deadweight loss doesn't matter here, as taxes would be levied only to lower spending.

>MMTers hold that inflation isn’t primarily the result of excessively strong growth. They blame much of it on businesses’ excessive pricing power. So before trying to choke off growth to kill inflation, they would try to break up monopolies and stop banks from making too many loans.

This is also bad economics.  Inflation is by definition an increase in the *price level*.  Monopoly power should show up in *relative* prices (the prices you get out of your supply/demand graphs either in perfect competition, monopoly, etc).  Breaking up monopolies would lower *relative prices* (an admirable goal!) but would not lower *inflation* which is a rise in nominal prices.

>Mainstream economists argue that the correct parts of MMT aren’t new and the new parts aren’t correct. But MMTers point out that the establishment hasn’t covered itself in glory in recent years—largely failing to foresee the global financial crisis a decade ago, for instance. 

It is astounding that MMTers are pulling the ""economists didn't see the financial crisis coming"" card.  Neither did MMTers!  This is nothing but an appeal to the populists that give you a soap box.  I don't think I need to point that this doesn't prove MMT is correct, nor does it show that macroeconomics is wrong.

Overall, this article displays bad economic thinking on a few levels.  However, we can cut to the core of MMT by thinking about money neutrality and whether or not seignorage can finance real government spending.  If long-run money neutrality is incorrect (and that a laissez-faire economy can't achieve full employment) then MMT observations about the real world are correct and policy makers should shift their thinking.  I do not think that this is the case as both theory and evidence suggest otherwise.  I await an MMT model and a regression to estimate.",wumbotarian,t2_cazkr,0.96,201,154

First a disclaimer that this is only sort of bad economics.  It's more misunderstanding of the legal regime underlying U.S. antitrust policy with the occasional bad economics thrown in.

I'll focus on the first two points mostly because honestly most of the others are only tangentially economics.  That being said, where there is economic content that I think is wrong I will point it out.   

> Myth #1: ""Big Tech companies are monopolies""

The core problem with this line is his definition of the relevant market.  The way we do this in the US is through a principle called the [*Hypothetical Monopolist Test*](https://www.justice.gov/atr/operationalizing-hypothetical-monopolist-test).  The core of the test is based around the idea of substitutability: it's essentially asking the question what is the smallest possible product market over which it would be profitable for a hypothetical monopolist to raise a price significantly.  Significantly here is given in terms of the SSNIP, the small but significant and non-transitory increase in price.  That is the relevant antitrust market.  

To give credit where it's due, he definitely understands that substitutability is the core of what matters!  But he does get pulled a little bit off course as well, writing things like: 

> Critics of big tech often try to define arbitrarily narrow markets to show a market share in excess of two thirds... If anything the simultaneous  rise and fall of print advertising -- while other advertising channels have remained intact -- suggests that 'US digital advertising is too narrow of a market.  It seems that users are substituting digital advertising for print advertising.

The problem with this is that the question is as to the current substitutability  of digital and print advertising.  That one went down and the other up at the same time is not sufficient evidence that the two are substitutes going forward.  To see why, consider a question of how customers would respond if a single firm monopolized the digital advertising space *but not the print advertising space*.  How would the customers respond?  For the two distinct products to lie in the same market, the diversion from the digital advertising space to print would have to be so large as to make the price increase unprofitable, and that *ex ante* seems a dubious proposition.  The rise in digital advertising and the decline of print were driven by the same force (the decline of print media and the rise of digital media/the internet), but note that in that case the advertising followed the readers, and that's really what drove the dynamic.  A change in the relative prices now doesn't really undo that, so I'm skeptical that they are still substitutes.  Of course, as with everything this is an empirical question.  

>Myth #2: ""Big Tech harms consumers""

Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.  Alec here rightly points out that the consumer welfare standard is what governs antitrust in the US.  But the consumer welfare standard does not just refer to prices!  Pointing out that prices are zero or falling is wrong on two fronts: 1)it ignores the counterfactual (i.e. would prices have fallen more), and 2)it ignores the bulk of the antitrust criticisms of big tech.  Some of these criticisms are of the flavor that big is (inherently) bad.  These tend not to be very convincing.  But there are some very specific criticisms that are substantially more likely.  

For instance, one of the big things that antitrust regulators are grappling with right now is with regards to Amazon basics (it's in-house brand).  The concern is essentially that Amazon, since it owns both the market and a participant in the market can use its marketplace power to incentivize people to buy its own products at the expense of competitors.  Often times people here are concerned about things that Amazon could do to the other sellers (e.g. require them to pay large entry fees, reducing the attractiveness of entry by raising the initial fixed costs).  More insidiously, one of the concerns is that threat of amazon doing this could, itself, disincentivize entry.  Note that this kind of long-run dynamic effect is inherently hard to estimate because you are trying to model how amazon's market power affects the creation of firms far in the future.^1 

> Myth #3: ""Big Tech doesn't innovate""

Setting aside the obvious problems with using R&D spending as a measure of innovation, I think there is a philosophical problem with this point.  Let's think about a merger between two companies X and Y.  The question that Alec would have us ask implicitly is, do X and Y have less of an incentive to innovate after the merger.  But that's not ultimately what antitrust regulators are concerned about.  The question to them is, will the markets that X and Y are in be less innovative after the merger?  The answers to the two questions often coincide (particularly in horizontal mergers) but not always in vertical ones.  To be fair, I don't think Alec was trying to make this point but I think it's something that a lot of people probably would've thought after seeing it.  

> Myth #4: ""Network effects make Big Tech unbeatable"" 

Alec here is right in that breaking up the big tech companies would almost surely harm consumers.  Network effects matter quite a bit!  It's not clear to me why he thinks network effects work in reverse.  The nature of big networks is that its relatively costly for new entrants not to be on the network, so it's hard to get rid of them.  If someone has relevant cites/wants to tell me I'm wrong, happy to hear it though.

> Myth #5: ""Big Tech is killing the startup ecosystem"" 

This is a time series of VC investment, but the relevant question is what is VC spending in the absence of the big tech companies, which the stated graph does nothing to address.  

> Myth #6: ""Big Tech companies only compete in one market""

They do compete against each other a lot of the time, but again, need to be careful with market definition here.  

I don't really care about the other ones other than:

> Myth #10: ""It was obvious that some Big Tech acquisitions were anticompetitive""

Alec is absolutely 100% right here.  Regulators do the best they can and ultimately it's often not easy to tell.  Retroactive policing is also very hard under the current legal regime (although not just because of the legal regime, scrambled eggs are a problem too).  

I think, ultimately Alec's implicit conclusion that it would be unwise to break up big tech is right, but it does no one any favors by making sloppy arguments about it.  Amazon in particular is a bit of a thorny problem with Amazon Basics (you'll note that one of the two theories of harm is really just a pretty bog standard RRC theory of harm a la e.g. [Crawford et al. 2018](https://web.stanford.edu/~ayurukog/ECTA14031.pdf)).  The policy implication, if you buy the long-run entry theory of harm is of course that you need to separate Amazon the marketplace from Amazon the provider (preferably via a behavioural remedy I think).  

^1 To be clear, I'm not sure I buy this, but pointing to historical price series is typically not well-regarded by practitioners, since the nature of antitrust is that it is forward looking, not backwards.",Hypers0nic,t2_fp61x,0.94,168,41
648,f3coz1,2020-02-13,badeconomics,Pulling out a benchmark isn't enough; you need to use a control group.,"There was a recent [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2759843) in JAMA Network Open purporting to find a six-percentage-point increase in employment or education enrollment (54.3% to 60%) among enrollees in Michigan's Medicaid expansion.

I posted about this in [the 'burbs](https://old.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/ex1f31/the_single_family_homes_sticky_31_january_2020/fg5utyj/) a while back, but having thought about it some more and growing more confident in my understanding of exactly what went wrong here, I'm giving it the full RI treatment.

The TL;DR of the methodology is that the authors collected a sample of people in the Healthy Michigan Plan (Michican's Medicaid expansion), found out how many were in employment or education (54.3%) as of January 2017, and then followed up with them a year later. At follow-up, 60.0% were in employment or education.

Because enrollment wasn't randomized, they didn't have a control group. As an alternative, they benchmarked this result to the overall employment or education rate (henceforth EER) of Michigan residents age 19-64 (increased 74% to 75%; somehow p=0.64, which I suspect is a whole other RI), and to the EER of Michigan's low-income residents 19-64 (42.7% to 43.0%).

These findings are extremely suspicious for a few reasons:

* The Oregon Medicaid study, which used a randomized control, found no effect on employment or earnings.
* Despite a six-percentage-point increase in the EER among a huge chunk of Michigan's low-income adult population, there was virtually no increase in the overall EER of Michigan's low-income adult population.
* The result doesn't seem to have been mediated by treatment of chronic health problems; the EER increase among participants with chronic health problems was the same as among those without chronic health problems.

So what's going on here? Well, it turns out that the methodology used in this study virtually guarantees a spurious finding of a positive employment effect.

The fundamental problem is the lack of a proper control group. Benchmarking to the employment rate of the adult population, or even the low-income adult population\*, is not a valid control, because these only reflect net changes in employment, while failing to account for individual turnover in the unemployed population.

The primary determinant of eligibility for Medicaid/HMP enrollment is low income. A common cause of low income in a given calendar year is unemployment for part or all of that year; hence the 54.3% EER among participants in the initial survey, compared to 74% in the general adult population. Unemployment and labor force nonparticipation are often temporary. A person may have a spell of bad luck and be unemployed for several months, and then find a job. A person may leave the labor force to take care of a family member, and then return. A person may suffer a temporary disability, recover, and return to the labor force. Although I'm usually quite gainfully employed, I myself was voluntarily out of the labor force in 2011, earning no money and thus falling below the poverty line.

Consequently, a sample of low-income individuals will likely contain many individuals who are only temporarily unemployed. Even if no intervention (such as Medicaid enrollment) is applied, it is likely that we will find, upon follow-up a year later, that many of them have found jobs. Some will have lost jobs as well, of course, but since a sample of low-income individuals oversamples the temporarily unemployed, we should expect to see a net increase in employment among the sample, even if the overall employment rate remains unchanged.

I'm fairly confident that explains most, if not all, of the positive EER effect found here. Theoretically it could explain more than 100%, and the true causal effect could be negative. I appreciate the difficulty of finding a proper control group under these circumstances, but the benchmarking approach here is a woefully inadequate substitute, and virtually guarantees a spurious positive employment effect due to turnover in unemployment as described above. Without a proper control group, these findings cannot be interpreted as evidence for a positive employment effect.

-------------

\* Incidentally, the employment rate among the low-income population is particularly difficult to interpret because the low-income population is in large part defined by lack of employment: A person who is unemployed for most or all of a calendar year will likely have low income in that calendar year. If employed year-round in the following year, the worker may cease to be classified as low-income, and thus fail to increase the employment rate among the low-income population. Paradoxically, a low employment rate among the low-income population can be a sign of a strong economy: If wages are high enough to keep the vast majority of workers above the low-income threshold, then relatively few individuals below the low-income threshold will be employed. As such, the employment rate for low-income individuals should never be used in the manner in which it is used here.",brberg,t2_fdq0n,0.97,111,17

> although economists have historically wanted their field to be associated with the so-called hard sciences – a conjuring act exemplified by the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences

I'm not sure how having a Nobel Prize associates a field with the hard sciences - there are Nobel Prizes in Peace and Literature and nobody claims they are hard sciences. Or maybe Ms. Benack is referring to the ""Economic *Sciences*"" part of the official name? In any case, I'll have more to say about economic methodology later.

> Unlike economics, which deals with human relationships, the hard sciences study phenomena in the natural world.

Human relationships *are* phenomena in the natural world. I don't see how the study of animal behaviour can be a hard science, but not the study of human behaviour (although the latter is definitely much more challenging).

> As such, a claim by a natural scientist reflects a different kind of truth than one by an economist. For example, the law of gravity describes an immutable physical fact; the law of supply and demand describes a relationship between people.

Not everyone who is in contact with someone infected with a virus will catch it, and everyone who catches it will react differently: so, immunology is not a hard science? Because it doesn't describe ""immutable physical facts"", it seems.

> What we know as mainstream economics today began with the concept of marginal utility

The father of economics is generally considered to be Adam Smith, who certainly never spoke about marginal utility. The father of macroeconomics is Keynes, who also didn't speak much about marginal utility (although he was certainly familiar with the concept). Arguably, marginal utility is an important concept in microeconomics, but microeconomics was not born from the concept of marginal utility, it was born from marginalism generally speaking.

> The concept of marginal utility allowed economists to turn sensations into quantities. Happiness was imagined as a pile of many little units of pleasure, which some economists actually believed could be physically measured.

I don't think any economist today believes happiness can be measured. Ms. Benack is attacking a strawman.

> Models of economic theory require this same suspension of disbelief. We know that there is no world with perfect competition, as one famous economic theory asserts, so we’re asked to set aside the criteria we would usually apply to understand something as objectively real to follow the story the theory – and economist – tells about the economy.

We also know that Newtonian physics don't apply to the real world. That doesn't prevent it from being useful. In fact, there is no complete theory of physics, or any other field, yet. I don't see how having imprecise theories about the world prevents an academic field from being a (hard) science.

> This reliance on our attitude toward fiction is not exclusive to the models used in economics. The same could be said about, for example, the idea of a perfect vacuum in physics. We know there is no perfectly empty space, yet we can imagine it.

So she *is* aware her argument doesn't hold water.

> According to economic texbooks, individuals make choices by considering how much happiness they derive from different options. Say I have an hour I could use to either buy groceries, catch up with a friend, or take a nap. I assess my options and find that grocery shopping is not that important right now, seeing my friend would be nice, but napping really promises the largest amount of happiness.

Reasonably good description of how opportunity cost works.

> Consequently, I choose to nap, but the price I pay for my nap is the happiness I would have derived from my second-best option, spending time with my friend. Note that this second-best option did not and will not occur, and the individual in this story knows this as she is imagining her options.

So far, so good.

> In other words, fiction occupies a very prominent position in the opportunity cost story, and, by extension, in economics at large. Each decision we make, economists are saying, is accompanied by a piece of fiction.

Wait, what? Just because a certain concept in economics relies on counterfactuals, this means economics as a field is a fiction? That's like saying that because thermodynamics relies on randomness, thermodynamics itself is random. There can be precise laws about random facts; there can be real laws involving counterfactuals.",smalleconomist,t2_1kuf7f,0.97,284,156
650,mtrbzk,2021-04-19,badeconomics,[Low-hanging fruit] Tumblr post screencapped on instagram doesn't know the difference between gross and net profit.,"I came across this instagram post from some random page that the all-powerful algorithm gods decided to show me: https://imgur.com/a/fLVwEje

(there was some additional content about health insurance which I can’t comment on). 

Their claim boils down to “Walmart can easily afford the minimum wage, it’s a tiny fraction of their profits to pay everyone another 7.25$ per hour.”

The first thing you may notice is the calculation at the top of the second image. 1.5 million employees, another 7.5 dollars per hour, 40 hours per week, all good… and that’s it. 4.35 billion dollars is the *weekly* cost. This number is then compared to Walmart’s *annual* profits. That clearly isn’t going to be very useful! So the estimated 3.3% of profit is off by a factor of 50 (assuming 2 weeks vacation); this mistake alone means that the correct result of this estimate would be 165%, or over one and a half times all of Walmart’s profit. 

The second thing you may notice is the very high profit. Walmart is known for being a high-volume, low-price company in an industry (retail) with generally low margins. Walmart’s revenue in 2019 was about [$514 billion](https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2019/05/16/walmart-releases-q1-fy20-earnings), which means this post is asserting Walmart’s profit margin was over 25% in 2019! The post mentions this is their gross profit, which is [“the profit a company makes after deducting the costs associated with making and selling its products”](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossprofit.asp). In particular, fixed costs are excluded, so we are totally ignoring rent, certain salaries, advertising, and other major costs. Clearly, we can’t use this number to determine if Walmart can afford a 15$ minimum wage or not. Instead, let’s use net profit (or net income), which [includes all costs](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101314/what-are-differences-between-gross-profit-and-net-income.asp). Walmart’s net income in [2019](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/WMT/financials/annual/income-statement) was about 6.7 billion dollars. By this calculation, a 15$ MW would cost Walmart over 30 times their annual profits. 

(To make it even weirder, contradicting the post itself, the caption says ""And that's net profits, after all the costs of running the business."")

Is the actual cost that high? Almost certainly not. The post made the assumption that all of Walmart’s 1.5 million US employees currently make minimum wage, which is not correct; any employees already making over MW will decrease the marginal cost of a higher minimum wage. 2019 appears to be a [low point](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/WMT/walmart/net-profit-margin) for Walmart’s net profit. And Walmart could probably replace some labor costs with capital, like investing in more self-checkout stations, or just reduce costs flat-out by closing stores. How much would it *actually* cost them? Possibly very little. [This](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/walmart-pledges-to-raise-wages-to-15-per-hour) says their average wage is already 14$ per hour, and they will be increasing it to over 15$ in the future. But regardless of the actual cost, this post does a terrible job of estimating it.",viking_,t2_815d9,0.96,242,51

This Muse song represents a classic misunderstanding of economic growth, of the
second law of thermodynamics, and of the acceptable amount of dubstep in a Muse

Here, Bellamy makes the basic mistake of thinking that endless e-e-e-economic growth
means endless energy growth. While there's no denying that all e-e-e-economic
activity and technological p-p-p-processes requires some amount of energy, it
is a mistake to think that growth requires always more TTTenergy. Economic growth
is a measure of the increcrecre-crreases of value of goods and services, but
more value doesn't necessarily require more energy consumption.

Indeed, technological p-p-p-p-progress makes it possible to produce more va̺͓̹lụ̱̟̣̮ḙ̥̟̝̠
with less energy, as value isn't a physical quantity but an expression of
human p̫̻r͓͚̮͎e̹ference. If people prefer reading comics instead of taking their car,
comics have a higher value but a lower eṉ̭̠̖̖̫̹̥e̬̪r̦̮̬̮̞͈g͓y̳̟ consumption.

Learning to p-p-p-pproduce things in a more energy-efficient way, which is
presumably what people worried about ᴜɴsᴜsᴛᴀɪɴᴀʙility want, will show up as
growth. Therefore, one might argue that endless growth is the only path to

For all intents and purposes, the earth [is not an isolated

limited by the heat death of the universe, in which case you're [technically
right](https://xkcd.com/1475/). But no reasonable definition of sᴜsᴛᴀɪɴability

So, here's what I had written up about this paper, in no particular order

* Standard errors are clearly wrong.  Observations are correlated based on their order and store(both employee and observer).  You can think of the errors based on order correlation as something akin to an AR-1 process.
* Conditional upon ordering a fancy drink, If women order such with extras like no whip with soy and men do not, then the model suffers from omitted variables bias.  The fact that there is no difference in magnitude (or significance) for non-fancy drinks suggests this might be the case.
* The study design lacks an ability to control for many unobservables.  For example, they could have sent the same person in to order the exact same drink following the same 'script'.  Noisy data in, noisy estimates out.
* Lack of economic significance.  This is a common failing of many papers across all fields of study.  Suppose women do wait for their coffee 30 seconds more than men, controlling for a host of factors and assuming that this extra time does not produce a positive, non-monetary benefit.  So what?  What's the economic effect then?  Is it a few cents of utility loss?  Good studies have meaningful economic effects that are easily described in their abstract.

While for many other countries, such as India, Russia or China, where official data is often either not available to the public, unreliable, or highly biased propaganda, sourcing information from non-official sources might be necessary, it is not for most free, developed countries - such as the United States - where high-quality data is available to the public. However, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) generally tends to slightly overestimate every country's defense budget, so that does not really mess up the comparison by much.

Second of all, these figures are nominal, they are not adjusted for purchasing power, a piece of military equipment produced in a poorer nation is naturally going to be considerably cheaper than the same piece military equipment produced in wealthier nations, personnel even more so. For example, the Russian T-14 Armata Main Battle Tank costs [$3.7 million per unit](https://www.popmech.ru/made-in-russia/211141-nazvana-tsena-tanka-armata/), while the similarly capable M1A2 Abrams costs $10.31 million [according to estimates by the DoD from FY1999](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/budget/fy1999/dot-e/army/99m1a2.html) [adjusted for inflation](https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1999?amount=6.21). Why is that? Because of the price of labor. This also applies to consumer goods, which is why so many goods sold in developed countries are produced in developing countries, like China or India. However, the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) index generally used for adjusting for such differences, can only be used for adjusting the price of physical goods, such as military equipment, not personnel pay/benefits. So a [military-Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) index](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/roiw.12536) was created to adjust for these differences. Adjusted for military-Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) China's defense budget was about 11.10% higher, India's defense budget about 3.38% higher and Russia's military budget about 26.97% higher, than when adjusted with the standard Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) index as of 2019. Adjusted using the standard Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) to military-Power Parity (PPP) index-ratio, China's alleged [$252 billion unadjusted 2020 defense budget](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2021/world-military-spending-rises-almost-2-trillion-2020) increases to [$455.27 billion](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2021/October/weo-report?c=924,&s=NGDPD,PPPGDP,NGDPDPC,PPPPC,PPPSH,&sy=2019&ey=2026&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1), India's alleged [$72.9 billion unadjusted 2020 defense budget](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2021/world-military-spending-rises-almost-2-trillion-2020) increases to [$260.45 billion](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2021/October/weo-report?c=534,&s=NGDPD,PPPGDP,NGDPDPC,PPPPC,PPPSH,&sy=2019&ey=2026&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1) and Russia's alleged [61.7 billion unadjusted 2020 defense budget](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2021/world-military-spending-rises-almost-2-trillion-2020) increases to [$217.26 billion](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2021/October/weo-report?c=922,&s=NGDPD,PPPGDP,NGDPDPC,PPPPC,PPPSH,&sy=2019&ey=2026&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1). [This is what the chart shown in the article would look like if the figures were adjusted with the military-Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) index, while still using Stockholm International Peace Research Institute data](https://imgur.com/a/CwK4LkZ).

So no, from a practical sense, the United States does not spend more on defense than the next 11 countries combined, not even close.",canufeelthebleech,t2_4kpdfq02,0.84,223,161
654,4yy0l3,2016-08-22,badeconomics,"Eugenics, Malthusianism, and the Tragedy of the Commons","First post, be gentle, only doing this for shitposting privileges, yada yada.

This is adapted from something I'm actually using for school, so it may come off as a bit formal.

http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html

**Tl;dr of the article:**

Hardin’s central point is that we must implement a system of eugenics. He describes our world as finite and zero-sum, and thus follows to that point that as world population increases, each person’s “per capita share of the world's goods must steadily decrease.”

In breeding, Hardin insists, we see a tragedy of the commons, where each person gains the most individually by producing more children, although humanity as a whole loses the more people are born. In order to “deal with the family, the religion, the race, or the class (or indeed any distinguishable and cohesive group) that adopts overbreeding as a policy to secure its own aggrandizement,” Hardin suggests we implement a system of “mutual coercion mutually agreed upon,” in essence, of laws, that limit breeding. He argues that the right to reproductive autonomy should be fundamentally discarded, as lowering the growth of population is so desirable that it amount to creating more freedom. 

Hardin posits that humanity has restricted freedom and closed several “commons” in a similar way throughout history, namely in the creation of property rights, which closed the commons of land, and in the restriction of pollution, which closed the commons of air and water.


**My R1:**

Hardin’s argument is flawed in several ways in both theory and implementation.

Let’s examine Hardin’s central claim that as population increases, “the per capita share of the world's goods must steadily decrease,” and thus greater populations lead to led happy people. Let’s consider the opposite extreme, then: imagine that everyone in the world were to disappear save for a single person. They would have ownership of all resources, so according to Hardin, they must be ultimately happy. In reality, however, this would be a nightmare, as no single person is able to maintain the infrastructure of the modern world, and most people would be lucky to just be able to find enough food to feed themselves every day in this scenario.

The flaw in Hardin’s reasoning is a inability to distinguish the quantity of resources available from quantity of utility available (utility here meaning the use, or happiness, a person derives from available resources). While resources are finite, utility is not. Imagine, for example, that an engine was invented that could produce twice the gas mileage-- twice the energy-- of any other car engine, while being just as expensive as any other motor. Humanity would double the utility it can get out of its gas reserves without those gas reserves changing in quantity.

If we look trends historically, we see greater populations actually having more utility per capita. The average American enjoys a higher standard of living than the average medieval peasant, who in turn is better off than the average Babylonian slave. Technology plays an important part in this, but larger populations also enabled greater specialization of individuals, which creates greater utility overall. While it may sound reasonable at first, there’s no reason to believe that greater populations lead to reduced utility per person.

Beyond that, Hardin’s ideas would be nearly impossible to implement. Look at the previous examples he gives of other “closings of the commons.” The first, the enclosure of private property, can hardly be said to exist as a distinct historical event, but it was almost certainly enforced by violence and territorial war. Environmental regulation was obviously not a violent process, but that was because the bulk of the restrictions were applied to corporations, and the practical freedom of the individual was infringed only by litter laws at worst. It’s hard to see the body politic relinquishing their rights to free reproduction-- along with the freedom to privacy and biological autonomy that would be needed to enforce it-- when there’s no real precedent. Even the historical laws that sought to place similar restrictions were entirely impossible to enforce. Such rights are so fundamental to humanity as a whole that any program of reform that truly sought to both implement and enforce Hardin’s regulations must be necessarily violent, invasive, and brutal.

The other problem with giving the government control of such a fundamental part of human life is that such power would almost definitely be wielded in a discriminatory way. The concept of “mutual coercion mutually agreed upon” provides no guarantee of fairness. Because we can’t expect every person to “mutually agree” to coercion, we must instead revert to majority rule. Majority rule, however, can become tyranny by majority, as the majority creates laws that benefit it at the expense of racial, religious, or cultural minorities. Even with our current limited government we struggle to keep legislation free of discrimination; allowing us to legislate on human reproduction would only make this task even harder, if not impossible.

Like any system of eugenics-- any regulation of reproduction is, by definition, eugenics-- Hardin’s train of thought will lead to discrimination by its nature. After all, if there a limited amount of people that can live in the world, shouldn’t we make sure that we only have the best people. If we let the government determine worthiness in this respect, than the bureaucrats running the system will let themselves and people like them reproduce before anyone else. In true Darwinian fashion, it would make sense to only let those who agree with Hardin reproduce, as its would be easier to limit human population if all parents are teaching their kids about how necessary eugenics is.

We can already see hints of racism in Hardin’s rhetoric about the welfare state, which learns dangerously close to the “welfare queen” concept: that blacks and other minorities are having more children in order to take advantage of the welfare state. Hardin talks of dealing with “the family, the religion, the race, or the class (or indeed any distinguishable and cohesive group) that adopts overbreeding as a policy to secure its own aggrandizement,” thus explicitly stating that he would seek to target groups such a Catholics, who don’t believe in birth control, or polygamists, including Fundamentalist Mormons and Muslims. 


**Tl;dr:**Hardin is proposing an impossible and racist solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.

The point of this R1 is to critique claims made in a [recent R1](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/o38j4e/a_short_but_sweet_r1_yes_profit_maximization_can/). Note that I am not R1ing the article the original R1 cited, but rather I am R1ing claims made in the original R1. Without getting anything more confused, I nonetheless hope this is a productive exchange and one we can all learn from. I don’t necessarily think that the original R1 was bad, but I do think there were some weak claims made that could be improved upon, and that there are different interpretations of the data/science which challenge the conclusions of the original R1. 

Also, for clarity purposes, below I will cite OP’s 3 main points that I will be R1ing, with my comments underneath them. 

Without further ado, let’s jump into it.  

&#x200B;

>**Point 1: People Have Relative Advantages**  
>  
>*This point is really a non-subtle point that any lay-man can make about the point being made. Managers and firms have absolute advantages in this. A good mechanical engineer is generally not as good at being a quant than someone who has a PhD in financial mathematics. If a mechanical engineer had a choice between being a quant, or being a consultant for automobile manufacturing they would not get the ""blockbuster returns"" of being a quant because frankly, they are aren't very good at it. However, they can make a lot of great money consulting for automobile companies. I should know this, I've worked in the automotive industry for a while. Note that this is entirely justified solely on profit-maximizing grounds. Of course you can argue that the mechanical engineer should have went to quant school and done quant things, but I don't think it's a super controversial point to make that people have different skills and talents that occur by random chance, and some people just aren't good at being a quant.*

So, I don’t have issue with the statement that people have different skills and talents. As much as I practice my jump-shot, I will never be the next Michael Jordan. But I do have issue with the idea that skills and talents occur by random chance, which is the main basis for point 1. If it’s true that skills and talent occur by random chance, then your chance of becoming the next Bill Gates or Elon Musk would be just as good as if you were born on a rural farm in Nebraska, or in the crime-ridden neighborhood of Englewood Chicago, or in the wealthy suburbs outside of Silicon Valley. 

Unfortunately, there is plenty of supporting evidence that this isn’t true. For starters, social mobility in the US is pretty poor. The [Global Social Mobility Index](https://www.weforum.org/reports/global-social-mobility-index-2020-why-economies-benefit-from-fixing-inequality) ranks the US 27 overall, well below many other industrialized countries. Turning our attention to the US specifically, Economist Raj Chetty and colleagues examine US social mobility in their [study](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6336/398) and say that:

*\[a\]bsolute mobility have fallen from approximately 90% for children born in 1940 to 50% for children born in the 1980s. Increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates alone cannot restore absolute mobility to the rates experienced by children born in the 1940s. However, distributing current GDP growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940 birth cohort would reverse more than 70% of the decline in mobility. These results imply that reviving the “American dream” of high rates of absolute mobility would require economic growth that is shared more broadly across the income distribution.* 

Moreover, sociologist Patrick Sharkey presents startling evidence in his book [*Stuck In Place*](https://www.amazon.com/Stuck-Place-Neighborhoods-Progress-Equality/dp/0226924254) showing how intergenerational transmission of skills, talent, and other factors are all tied to neighborhood environments. I can’t do this book justice and cite everything in it, but the main point is on page 33, where Sharkey rhetorically asks why is inequality, along any dimension, is transmitted across generations? His response:

*The most obvious reasons are that people develop ties, both social and psychological, that connect them with specific places. A child who is raised in a working-class neighborhood, for example, may continue to live in such a neighborhood even if he lands a job in a white-collar occupation and could afford to live in a more affluent neighborhood. The attachment to the neighborhood in which he was raised, the sense of belonging that he feels in a working-class area, may be more important than the desire to move to a new environment.* 

He goes onto describe many other mechanisms that constrain social mobility in America, concluding on page 34: 

*But the larger point is that all of the factors I have discussed – social and psychological ties to places, discrimination, informal intimidation, and individual preferences, provide unique explanations for why neighborhood advantages and disadvantages are particularly likely to linger on over time and to be passed on from parents to children. In other words, these factors support the hypothesis that neighborhood inequality may be one of the most rigid dimensions of inequality in America, and they help to explain why mobility out of the poorest neighborhoods may be even less common than mobility out of individual poverty.*  

The evidence presented thus far is even more damming when one considers other evidence by sociologist Florencia Torche, who studies the inter-generational transmission of education and advantage in the US. The common belief is that a college degree will increase U.S. social mobility, which has generally been true going back to the 1970s. However, her [work](https://web.stanford.edu/group/scspi/media/_media/working_papers/torche_education-intergenerational-transmission.pdf) shows that among those who get an advanced college degree, those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds are much more likely to go to universities with low levels of selectivity (less prestigious), and more likely to choose degrees and fields of studies which do not maximize their chances of success. As a consequence, people from advantage backgrounds are much more likely to take more lucrative jobs than people from disadvantaged backgrounds. An advanced degree can remove individuals from their social background, but it does not eliminate all sources of inequality in the US.

Thus, individual skills and talent are not randomly distributed but rather are linked to social class and neighborhood environments. A wealthy child who grows up to parents who get them private tutors, has ties to other wealthy families in the neighborhood, and is embedded within a social network that places them into specific occupations and careers when they grow older will be much more likely to end up working as a quant than anyone selected by random chance, statistically speaking. This child will then grow up and become a parent who invests in developing their child’s skills and talents, who will then grow up and invests in their child, etc. This not to say that some kids don’t “slip through the cracks”, where for example some Amish kid grows up and becomes a fortune 500 CEO, but the overall point I hope to illustrate here is that skills and talent are not randomly distributed in the population, but are largely passed on inter-generationally. 

&#x200B;

>**Point 2: People Have Comparative Advantages**  
>  
>*Let's make a subtler point that any person who took principles of economics could make. Imagine a household of 2 dudes who are trying to maximize their collective income, where the income potential of each dude in being a quant or being an engineer is represented by the following table.*



||Engineer|Quant|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dude 1|$100,000|$200,000|
|Dude 2|$70,000|$50,000|

>*Note that dude 1 is absolutely better as an engineer or a quant than dude 2, but to maximize income in this case the household would prefer Dude 1 to be a quant and Dude 2 to be an engineer, this is very similar to the absolute advantage point because we still get 1 of each but there's an added bonus that you don't even really need Dude 1 to be a particularly bad engineer, or a worse engineer than dude 2. You just need dude 1 to be better at being a quant than at being an engineer and dude 2 to be better at being an engineer than being a quant. There's a lot more than can be described in this kinda context but I think this suffices for this point.*

This is describing standard utility theory decision making. Just so we’re all on the same page, very briefly explained, utility theory assumes individuals behave rationally and maximize their expected utility by comparing expected gains between outcomes. The utility gained here is maximizing income by choosing between careers. What is implied by OP’s example is the risk each dude takes by choosing a career they are not qualified for (their comparative advantage/disadvantage) and being fired over earning more income in said career. 

My critique is not necessarily with utility theory, but rather a critique of utility theory applied to the example of Dude 1 and Dude 2. The example presented is incomplete for several reasons. For example, what are each dude’s preferences toward each career? Is each dude making their decision in isolation or together? Are they competing with each other for the same position? However, my main issue with it is that it lacks a reference point from which the options are evaluated. Without some monetary reference point, Dude 1 cannot evaluate the risk he takes by being a bad quant but getting more income over being a good Engineer but getting less income. Same is true for Dude 2. 

Let’s use an example. Read the following problems and select your choice. 

Problem 1: Which do you choose?

* Get $900 for sure 

OR 

* 90% chance to get $1,000

Problem 2: Which do you choose?

* Lose $900 for sure 

OR 

* 90% chance to lose $1,000

The majority of the public is risk averse and go with $900 in problem 1, while most people choose the gamble choice in problem 2 and risk losing 1,000. People become risk seeking when all their options are bad, but utility theory does not provide a way to accommodate different attitudes to risk for gains and losses. This applies to the dude example. Now consider 2 other problems:

Problem 3: In addition to whatever you own, you have been given $1,000. You are now asked to choose one of these options: 

* 50% chance to win $1,000 

OR 

* get $500 for sure

Problem 4: In addition to whatever you own, you have been given $2,000. You are now asked to choose one of these options:

* 50% chance to lose $1,000 

OR 

* lose $500 for sure 

By now this example should be very familiar, it comes from page 279 in *Thinking Fast and Slow*. It’s an example of [prospect theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory) developed by [Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman) and [Amos Tversky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky). Both problems 3 and 4 above are identical in terms of final states of wealth, and therefore should elicit similar preferences according to expected utility theory. If the utility of wealth is all that matters, then these transparently equivalent statements of the same problem should have yielded identical choices. Yet in problem 3, a large majority of respondents preferred the sure thing, while in problem 4 a large majority of respondents preferred the gamble. This pattern in decision-making violates expected utility theory and the axioms of rational choice on which that theory rests. 

What I’m trying to say is that if Dude 1 and Dude 2 are like most people, their preferences toward a career are a function of their reference point; the earlier state relative to which gains and losses are evaluated. As mentioned above, Dude 1 cannot evaluate the risk he takes by being a bad quant and being fired but getting more income over being a good Engineer and keeping his job but getting less income. Prospect theory here demonstrates that people think in terms of expected utility relative to a reference point (e.g. current wealth) rather than absolute outcomes. The examples in *TF&S* also show empirically how preferences of individuals are inconsistent among objectively the same choices, depending on how those choices are presented. When presenting and discussing the example in the original R1, OP should have discussed the limitations of utility theory and/or considered alternatives like prospect theory as it would have elicited a more productive discussion. 

&#x200B;

>**Point 3: Whether Profit Maximization causes changes in the real world has no bearing on whether profit maximization should be the sole goal of firms.**  
>  
>*This is the major critique. Friedman's argument about the social responsibility of businesses has absolutely nothing to do with what businesses do in practice. Friedman's argument is fundamentally a normative one, IE: An argument dealing with how businesses should behave in a just world. It is a moral argument that is arguing that for people to better off business should pursue profit maximization. Note that whether firms actually do profit maximize has no bearing on whether if having firms solely focus on profit maximizing will result in a more ethical world than one in which firms focus on social responsibility.*

This point is the least to do with economics and more to do with the normative moral claims Friedman makes with respect to the social responsibility of businesses. I don’t disagree with OP that whether or not a business focuses on social responsibility or maximizes profit will produce a more ethical world. All I will say on this point is that whether or not businesses actually maximize profit is not the issue. To me, the main issue people seem to have with Friedman’s view (that businesses have a social responsibility to maximize profit) is that it assumes we can lump together several different businesses together and that we can safely ignore the fact that there are differences between these institutions in their social and economic impact. 

If all businesses have a social responsibility to maximize profit, then [private prisons](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/capitalizing-on-mass-incarceration-u-s-growth-in-private-prisons/) have a social responsibility to incarcerate as many people as possible and expand their business model. However, does this actually make people better off? Even from a utilitarian point-of-view, this is a hard claim to justify. My point here is that Friedman ignores the fact that just because there is an opportunity to make a profit does not necessarily mean that every opportunity to make profit is a morally appropriate decision and is responsible from a societal point of view. Economic growth is not inherently morally right or wrong, but Friedman assumes it’s all good in the hood.",warwick607,t2_bryls,0.65,28,27

I work in a really niche design field where you have to sign a lot of NDAs and it's not easy to change jobs. For years top management used that and did their best to keep everyone in the dark when it comes to salary brackets and massively underpay production team, especially juniors. 

With time I got a vague understanding of the salary structure. A Junior could earn about £25k a year, a senior about £35k and a team leader would get a 40-something. These are far from competitive rates in the industry, and slowly but surely we've been losing more and more staff through covid times. Someone from finance decided that there was no retention budget and there will be no pay rises. At the same time, we had to fill in the gaps to keep up with the projects, so new job postings started popping up on the company website. Of course, there was no mention of salary range on any of them, apart from one...

A Senior job was listed with a salary of ""£55k plus"". Let me tell you, people got really pissed. Long-term employees realised how underpaid they were and started raising it with the management, who didn't budge. They used two excuses - ""new team members will bring invaluable experience to the team from outside of the business"" and ""we don't have a budget for pay raises, only for hiring"". This brilliant tactic paid off fully. Since this happened, we lost almost half of the team, some projects had to be scrapped altogether due to a lack of resources and expertise. The latest news is that we won't be getting any pay rises because we lost those projects...

Over the years Mike’s faced some discrimination there and is currently dealing with a scheduling conflict that we think is discriminatory. For two years he’s basically had a 10am-6:30pm shift, with random 3pm-11:30pm shifts thrown in. These “clopen” shifts completely mess with his diet and insulin ratios (has a pump and insulin regiment w doctors).

He’s communicated that the random night shifts make it difficult to manage his diabetes and handed in a doctors note requesting he work a consistent schedule. They completely ignored this request and scheduled him a few “clopens” next week. Mike pushed back and explained that the ADA states he has a right to a consistent schedule. Their response was to give him a schedule of 12pm-9pm. This change isn’t what he was pushing for and just wanted to work his normal 10am-6:30pm schedule. 

We honestly think they’re trying to fuck with him! He’s been there 7 years and has the most seniority in his department, why can’t they just keep his current schedule consistent?!

His past experience with discrimination there involved a manager asking him to preform a task and Mike said he’d do it, but had to deal with his low blood sugar first. The manager responded by saying “Maybe I should just pour sugar packets down your throat”. Mike unfortunately never reported it. Another time is was suspended for 3 days cause he defied managers orders so he could  fix his blood sugar. Mike complained to a regional manager (also diabetic) and he was reimbursed for the pay her lost from the suspension.

The New Zealand Government should consider making it compulsory for employers to publish starting salaries when advertising jobs, Parliament’s Education and Workforce select committee has recommended.

It said that requiring the publication of salaries in job adverts would help address an “information imbalance” between employers and potential employees.

672,wcaseq,2022-07-31,WorkReform,Fired because I refused to change from 40 hour work week to 70,"(This might be a long one)
(Looking for advice)
My boss just fired me because on several completely BS charges.

1)Lack of work ethic
2)poor turn around time
3)Lack of respect
4)Padding the resume

1-Lack of work ethic:
My boss called me into an office and told me that the company was dissatisfied with me leaving at 5 and stated that because they had hired me as tax exempt that I was expected to work 60-70 a week. I told my boss I couldn't do that because I have a family at home and due to the commute I only saw my kids for two hours a day (as we prepared dinner, ate, and put them to sleep). Boss looked me dead in the eye and says ""Oh, your one of THOSE employees. Who just do the minimum time and then run out expecting a handout paycheck.""

2)This one refers to a spreadsheet that has been developing over the course of several months because everytime I asked for resources to complete it I was pointed to old or completely invalid data BY MY BOSS. In our penultimate conversation I told my boss that if they wanted me to finish the spreadsheet that I needed to have the correct resources. Which they had not given me. I reminded them that we had discussed this in numerous group meetings and that the work could not be completed until I got valid resources. They were livid. Got dead serious and said ""THAT IS NOT HOW YOU TALK TO YOUR BOSS! I AM YOUR BOSS. YOU'RE NOT MINE. YOU DONT GET TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO!!!"" (The week I was fired they finally got me some valid info so I could could finish it before they let me know they were firing me). After each meeting I would ask what else I could do and my boss wouldn't respond sometimes for days. Then she  would tell me off for not taking more responsibility off her plate and claimed that I wasn't doing any work.

3)This one was interesting on several levels. The first is that the company claimes ""unlimited"" PTO so long as the work is getting done, they just ask that you let your  supervisor know in advance. That's how it was presented upon hiring and in a subsequent zoom conference meeting. I asked my boss 5 months in advance and was told I couldn't have the time off. In addition they were angry that i had gone through the official process to request time off and that i was supposed to ask them first if I COULD ask for the PTO  first. This seemed inconsistent with what the company had told me so I checked with HR. They sat on the fence and avoided taking a stance on this one for two weeks then finally told me that indeed my boss gets to decide not only when, but IF I get ANY PTO. So much for ""unlimited"". I'm so sick of these ""window display only benefit"" scams companies run these days. We should be able to hold them accountable for false advertising. 
Anything, my boss was PISSED that I hadn't asked their permission to ask off time.

-up till this point I've been referring to my boss as 'they' to avoid bias. However, at one point in the conversation my boss goes ""I feel you don't respect respect me because I'm ~gender here~, or because I'm ~age here~!"" Now our company claims to have a very strict non-discrimination environment and I respect every identity, orientation, nationality, and age. Yet here was my boss who was the opposite gender and significantly older suggesting that I don't respect them due to these factors, rather than the afore mentioned issues I've had with them. I feel like I'VE just been discriminated against.

4)My boss accused me of padding my resume. When they hired me I was blatantly honest with them as to what I have done, what experience I had and what cerfications i had aquired. (Computer science Bachelors, five years work experience in the field). Kept telling me ""I had an intern that did stuff better than you!"" Found out the intern was getting a masters in the field of actuarial sciences and they couldn't pay him enough to stay.

I've gotten this all on audio record, including my boss saying ""Employees are like kids! Sometimes you gotta spank them!"" and ""I'm a leader, which makes you a follower. And I need followers so I can be a leader!""

Fast forward a week and I show up to our weekly group meeting and yet nobody shows up but my boss and the HR rep who let me know I'm being terminated immediately. 

Now my wife and I are scamblimg to find any jobs to help us pay the bills on the house we bought six months ago and are feeling quite helpless. I don't know if there's any recourse we can take from such unprofessional acts. I know there are laws against discrimination which I feel have been violated, but I don't know where to go with the recordings to see if anything illegal or unethical was done. I live in Tennessee and know it's an 'at will' employment state.

Any advice would be appreciated. I don't want to lose our new home (we loved from Utah across the nation because the company said it needed us to relocate for the job).

The company is called Fortitude-Re by the way. They're a reinsurance company.",Stickboyhowell,t2_apegmf3j,0.98,1562,173
673,12mhdyl,2023-04-15,WorkReform,Gender Wage Gap - Question,"Questions for everyone: **Do you think commercial interior designers and architects working at the same firm should be payed the same?** 

Assuming they have the same experience level/years of experience, work on similar projects, etc.

To quote from the Equal Pay Act, ""*prohibits sex-based wage discrimination between men and women in the* ***same establishment*** *who perform jobs that require substantially* ***equal skill****, effort and responsibility under similar working conditions""*

According to this wording, architects and interior designers do 

1. Work at the **same establishment** (architecture firm, for example)

2. Perform jobs that require about **equal skill**. Both architects and interior designers are required to have at least a Bachelor's Degree in their field and often have a license. BOTH licensing processes involve going to an credited (NAAB or CACB accredited program for architects, and CIDA accredited program for interior designers). BOTH processes require having a certain amount of hours of working experience, and of course passing the exams.

\---- Architects get licensed through the NCARB (National Council of Architectural Registration Boards by taking the ARE (Architect Registration Examination).

\---- Interior designers get licensed through CIDQ (The Council for Interior Design Qualification) by taking the NCIDQ (the National Council for Interior Design Qualification) exams.

3. About **equal skill, effort and responsibility under similar working conditions**: again, if working at the same firm, I would argue there is effort, responsibility, and working conditions.

Both positions involve skills such as: knowledge of AutoCAD, Revit, Sketchup, or other modeling programs, create 2D and 3D drawings in those programs, knowledge of construction, construction administration, and converse with clients, vendors, managers, etc.

According do [salary.com](https://salary.com), in Washington DC, architects make a median of **$137,164** and interior designers in Washington DC make a median of $**56,143.** Less than half!

\-

The responsibilities of both positions vary from firm to firm of course, but it's my understanding that architects 'make the cake' and interior designers 'decorate the cake' so to speak. Definitely differences in specific knowledge on both sides. 

But please also consider that for Interior designers, 79% are women. And for architects, 76.7% are men. Quoting from Payscale about the gender wage gap, *""Interestingly, work designated as “women’s work” is perceived as less valuable only until men enter those occupations. For example, women were the original “computers,” but* [*computing positions earned low wages until men entered the field*](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/what-programmings-past-reveals-about-todays-gender-pay-gap/498797/)*. Conversely, when women enter fields previously dominated by men, the pay drops,* [*which has happened*](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/upshot/as-women-take-over-a-male-dominated-field-the-pay-drops.html) *with parks and recreation and interior design as well as other occupations.""*

Women’s median earnings are lower than men’s in nearly all occupations - think education, childcare services, nursing, social services, etc. Additionally, 'artsy' careers are also generally lower, for example, graphic designers, artists, decorators, etc.

Quote from The New York Times, *""A new study from researchers at Cornell University found that the difference between the occupations and industries in which men and women work has recently become the single largest cause of the gender pay gap, accounting for more than half of it. In fact, another study shows, when women enter fields in greater numbers, pay declines — for the very same jobs that more men were doing before.""*

*""...The same thing happened when women in large numbers became* ***designers*** *(wages fell 34 percentage points), housekeepers (wages fell 21 percentage points) and biologists (wages fell 18 percentage points). The reverse was true when a job attracted more men. Computer programming, for instance, used to be a relatively menial role done by women. But when male programmers began to outnumber female ones, the job began* [*paying more and gained prestige*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37710729_Making_Technology_Masculine_Men_Women_and_Modern_Machines_in_America_1870-1945)*.*

The general takeaway being, **work done by women simply isn’t valued as highly**. And that's why the gender pay gap exists in the first place.

675,xwo8du,2022-10-06,WorkReform,Boss discriminates against marginalized groups,"The VP I work under, I will call her C, has a streak of treating employees very poorly. Specifically women that are part of marginalized communities. 

Incident 1: coworker and friend of mine who referred me to the job was getting paid less than me even thought we did the same work. I am male btw. She met with C and requested a raise to match me and the other new hires. She was denied the raise many times by C. Eventually she explained to C that she was no longer happy at the company and is contemplating leaving due to the inequities and she eventually did. C made no effort to retain her. She was a woman POC

Incident 2: a coworker was not getting assigned the work she was hired to do and eventually got fed up and went to C to put in her 2 weeks. C fired her on the spot. She left the office crying. She has a daughter and is POC. 

Incident 3: a female coworker works from home part time. She originally worked full time in the office but wanted to quit. Since she was very smart and good at what she does so the company made a deal with her that she could get paid to work part time from home. So she took the deal and worked a new job and took the deal as a side job from home. After some time C tells her to come back to the office full time by the end of that month. Essentially telling her to quit her new job and come back to the one she originally didn’t like. She put in her two weeks and C fired her effective immediately. She was an openly lesbian woman. 

Incident 4:  This one is very recent. My coworker is actively going through a domestic abuse situation. Coming to work with broken ribs and another time a cast on her arm. She denies it is happening and avoids people who are trying to talk to her about it. She is currently on medical leave for physical and mental treatment. But before she left, C berated her to tears about her work performance not meeting standards. She is a POC woman. 

All these incident happened over the course of a year and are not cherry picked. She has never done anything like this to any male employees or straight white females. 

Clearly there is a pattern here and as a POC myself, I don’t feel comfortable working under her any longer and am planning to not work here my next year. 

But my question to Reddit is what could I realistically do about this?  None of these have been done to me so I don’t have standing to file a complaint with the EEOC. And we all know HR is not gonna do shit 90 percent of the time. 

I could try and bait a retaliation by opening the HR complaint and letting C know about it. I have been confirmed to be promoted sooner time in the future, so if I don’t get the promotion it could be seen as retaliation from C.

678,y3p5bg,2022-10-14,WorkReform,Male sexual harassment in the workplace,"It was only the other day I was at work in my relatively new job when the topic of sexual harassment came up after a woman there was told she looked pretty hot. She wasn’t bothered but said if he had touched her then she’d have either swung for him or reported him.

Then when I told her I’d been touched by older men and nothing has ever happened she looked confused. 

Once in school I had a teacher pull me to the side to “straighten my tie” but ended up holding me by my neck and unbuttoned my shirt to my chest. Then I got let go when people saw me struggling. Other teachers laughed when I told them about this. Apparently he was just “helping me.” Same story for the other boys who he ‘helped.’ But when a girl said he looked up her skirt he was suspended. 

Then I worked for some 60 odd year old man who seemed odd at first but I needed to escape a warehouse job so took it. After a couple of weeks he started locking the office door to stop others coming in. He would pat me on the head, rub my shoulders, squeeze my bicep and lean over me constantly. I felt like he was glued to me personal space. I left shortly after after because a full scale slanging match broke out between him and another member of staff. To me this one seemed like it could be just some creepy, tactile old guy so I never thought much of it after I quit.

Second I was working in a small factory when I had my shorts pulled down in front of everyone. Luckily my underwear just about held up but it was humiliating. I lost my temper and took it to management where I was told I would be fired if I ever pulled a stunt like that again. I couldn’t believe I got a warning for complaining about someone doing this to me but apparently I wasted their time and should have taken it as a joke. 

A few months later in the same job an independent contractor comes in to carry out repairs on some equipment. He pulls onto site where im in the middle of moving some pallets. He comes over to me, no warning for what he does next. Asks me if this is the right place, I say yes the machine is inside. Then clenches my leg, squeezes my inner thigh, rubs from knee to just under my nuts. He did this very hard, I could feel his thumb pressing deep. Proceeds to continue this for about 15 seconds whilst I’m sat there in shock. This happened in full view of the office where everyone watched what happened. I told the guy I needed to get on with my job, then he said “usually it hurts more when I do that.” Later on a manager comes to me laughing saying “oh he really wanted your ass son.” I didn’t bother complaining because apparently the boss thought it was funny too and I was on a warning from the shorts incident. 

Another incident there that wasn’t physical but annoyed me was when somebody printed a picture of a naked black guy and stuck it to my car. Ended up pretty dangerous since it got stuck under my windscreen wiper and smeared all over in the rain. Had to pull over in the dark to see that I’d been pranked again. When I spoke to the person who did it apparently he did it because I have a “puff looking face”

So whatever that means lol. 

Once I told my female colleague about these incidents, she was astonished, even the other guys were in shock. Now to me I’ve never thought of it as serious but apparently everyone I now work with thinks it’s pretty sickening.

A whole debate opened over what would have happened if I were female.

So, I quit! I told my manager that I wasn't even going to bother applying for the position she had been dangling in front of me, and was very up front about the reasons why I was leaving. Looking back at how I was treated, I can't even believe I stuck around for so long. I mean, they tried making me feel bad for using my PTO when my dad died! 

Anyway, I didn't have another job lined up when I quit. I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel like I made a huge mistake for the first few weeks of being unemployed. But, I did know for sure I HATED working in an office. I used to think the ultimate goal was to have a respectable office job, but fuck that. 

I decided I wanted to switch careers, and that I wanted a more physical job where I didn't have to be inside all day. So after some research, I discovered Land Surveying. Immediately I knew that what I wanted to do. 

There weren't many surveying positions listed around me, but after about 2 months of being unemployed, I landed an entry level surveying job with an engineering firm that is half the commute of my old job.

I absolutely love my new job. I've been at it for a little over three months now, and it's basically the opposite of my old job. Nobody cares when I come or go, as long as I get my job done. I am outside and in a new location every week, if not every day. On top of that, I get paid more, and am hourly so I actually get paid overtime. The company just gave me a $350 bonus and put me and my partner in a nice hotel for the company holiday party. They gave me $500 to spend on work clothes and boots. Health insurance, dental, and 401k are way better than what I had before. 

I could go on and on about why my new job is better, but i really just wanted to share in case someone is on the fence scared to quit their job because they don't think there's anything better out there.

HR > “Oh we are looking at 45k a year but have some wiggle room.

I expected that to be the end of the conversation. Literally 2 hours later I get asked to schedule an interview with their Accounting manager. 

Manager > “We are looking to pay $45k a year with a bonus of 2% and a small signing bonus”
Me > “I NEED 52-55k a year to even consider leaving my current position”

Once again I think this is the end of the conversation. Nope they ask me one more time for a final interview. This time I tell them I don’t think they can meet my salary requirements and it might be better not to waste each other’s time any more.

HR > “We ask that you hear us out as we will take your requirements in mind”

Well they offered me the position today… at a whopping $47k a year plus a $2000 signing bonus. Queue shocked pikachu.jpeg HR lady when I instantly turn down the offer and say no when she asks if I will think over for a few days.

“Goldin argues for systemic workplace reforms rather than the hearts-and-minds type of change so often advocated by girlbosses, self-help writers, and corporate feminists. Goldin, refreshingly, rejects any Lean In–type advice as ‘quick-fix notions’ utterly unable to address the fact that our ‘work and care systems are relics of a past when only men had careers and families.’ Greedy work, to be blunt, assumes that the worker has a wife at home. It therefore forces one-half of many couples to, if not stay home full-time, then prioritize the domestic front, choosing less well-paid jobs that offer greater structure and flexibility so their partners can work whatever hours their bosses demand.”

One minor difference is female shirts have a small cut in the bottom hem of both sides in the middle, hard to notice.  So here is my problem....the ""dress code"" states that only the MALES have to tuck their shirts in, females do not, this is actually in their handbook in writing!  I complain because it comes untucked while doing work ALSO I want to see equal treatment as well.  I asked that they change the dress code to include that everyone tuck their shirts in, including FEMALES....I am ignored and have been reprimanded for not having my shirt tucked in.  Is this at all discrimination since it's based on sex? The argument I have rec'd from the corporate office so far is the FEMALES have a different style shirt.

694,18dlov6,2023-12-08,WorkReform,Wife and I are being fined from a job that made it basically impossible to quit. What should we do?,"My wife and I worked at a private school in TN (Montgomery County). We didn't really want to sign our original contract, but we were both freshly graduated in 2022 and needed a job in the same city. Even before signing, we knew the language in the contract was kind of sleezey, but again, we needed a job. 

We were planning on working there at least 2 years, but we were still on the lookout for other teaching jobs. They tried to get us to sign our next contracts (for the 23-24 school year) in January of 2023, when there were absolutely no jobs open. I pushed back a bit and didn't sign it, so the school required for me to meet with our president during my planning periods until I signed it. I needed this time to plan and they were going to keep doing this so I signed it (so did my wife). 

In this contract, the **""Employment and Compensation"" clause** states:  . . . ""The school agrees to employ . . . beginning July 1, 2023 . . . and ending June 30, 2024. . . The first installment shall be payable on August 5, 2023 . . . with the final installment payable on July 5, 2024. The school year shall consist of not less than 180 teaching days . . .Official ending of the school year is May 24, 2024"" (This is the only info that might be relavent. Our previous contract was very similar, but it was for the 22-23 school year)

However, the **""Resignation"" clause** states . . .""No resignation shall become effective until the close of the Agreement period unless accepted by the President and the said President shall fix the time in which the resignation or release is to take effect. The Teacher will give at least 30 days notice before resigning. In circumstances when a resignation is submitted and accepted prior to the close of the agreement period, the Teacher may be subject to a **penalty in the amount of up to 10% of the Teacher's agreed upon annual salary**."" Then my wife and I signed these contracts on Feb. 22 of 2023

This summer in early June, my wife found out about a vacancy at a dream school and we were very excited for the opportunity! However, we didn't tell anyone at our current school because if she didn't get the job, then we would have just stayed here. Turns out, we didn't find out she got the job until July 7th of 2023, and right whenever she got the offer, we sent our official resignation notice to the school (so our last day was supposed to be August 7th - technically)

During that month, we tried to help our previous school find teachers to cover our positions and advertise the positions in every way that we knew. However, they still enacted the resignation fine of 10% of **both** of our annual salaries, as well as providing no compensation for the month of July. We were trying to figure out what to do about this, when in August, we got an official notice of end of employment for both my wife and I for June 31, 2023. We believe they sent us this as a justification for not paying us the following month (even though we continued to work and help them, and we have a paper trail of them requesting our help). After they sent this to us, we just stopped contact for a while, but they just reached out (11/28)  asking us about when we can pay our fine. 

So my questions are:

1. Should we have been paid for the month of July for continuing to work for them until the 30 days notice was up?
2. Does our document saying that our last day of employment was June 31 have any grounds to prevent them from enacting this fine? We're worried that even if we would have given them notice way earlier, since we signed the contract in February, any time that we resigned after signing this could have technically led to us being fined. 

We're just already behind for having a whole month without pay, and we simply cannot afford a fine that's worth 10 percent of our annual salaries. We also think that this contract is not a very fair contract, but I know that in TN, Judges often favor sticking to the contract, no matter how poorly it's written, because we did technically sign them.

695,xvkfdm,2022-10-04,WorkReform,Work added a dress code policy after me is it discrimination?,"So I started working for a country club and kept all of the paper work regarding the dress code policy. It states “hair must be neat and tied back from the face” nothing states the color of the hair. The top of my head is brown and the very ends are blonde. I dye the ends random colors like blue and purple periodically. While at work the color only shows in a bun at the back of my head and it has been dyed for 3months. I was recently told I have to dye my hair back to blonde or cover it while working and an updated policy was sent out by email. Is this some kind of discrimination or something towards me that I can fight?
Update: I do not want any responses regarding changing it or quitting because I am not going to do either of those. I have been keeping it covered and respecting what is asked of me. However, I am currently enrolled in a Defying workplace bias course apart of my construction management major and it just doesn’t seem right that I have been singled out.

697,v84rwf,2022-06-09,WorkReform,There should be federal regulation saying that the highest salary at a company should not exceed 20x the lowest salary and 10x the average salary.,"I'm throwing arbitrary numbers out, but I'm sure a study would find the ideal numbers. The point is to encourage higher base pay with the first number and higher average pay with the second.

Edit: Love the conversations in the comments. Lots of good ideas being thrown around. I'll edit some of the ones into a summary here once I get the chance to go through them.

__This should take total compensation into account, not just base salary.__ 100% agree. I just threw the idea of there to get people thinking. Sounds like people are catching the essence of the idea.

__It shouldn't be 20x and 10x.__ Maybe not, and maybe it shouldn't be based on lowest and average compensation, but these ideas are arbitrary. The essence is that leader compensation should be based on the fairness of the compensation of their employees. The specifics of that are where I'd like to see your ideas. Please fire away.

__There's lots of loopholes to exploit.__ I would argue that this is the case with practically every law, but that's the reason we try and refine these things. Airtight (or close to airtight) laws do exist... they just take a lot of work and iterative change. And yes, there are corrupt lawmakers and yes, a lot of them are ""owned"" by big corp. Whole separate issue, though you could argue that doing this through government may not be the way to go. Gotta start somewhere, and I'm not sure unions have the teeth to enforce this kind of thing in every industry (some maybe).

__Better to just completely redo the tax code.__ I'm not saying that this should be in lieu of redoing the tax code. I'm all for a new tax code, especially one that's consumption based, not income based. But there's a lot of ideas for a better tax code, like a flat income tax, getting rid of deductions altogether, and many others. These all have merit and they all have drawbacks. One thing I'll say, though, is that I believe that redoing the tax code is a much bigger effort than this.

__Lobbying and corruption would never allow this to happen.__ With the current state of our government, this is true. But lots of positive change around fair pay and cost of living won't happen unless some major changes happen in our government. So yes, this is a very optimistic post that assumes positive changes to our lawmaking.

__Can't you just outsource your labor to skirt around the rule?__ Yes, but verbiage in the law could extend the rule to outsourced labor.",ChaoticGood3,t2_j2vhc2qi,0.97,2447,235

701,sfith4,2022-01-29,WorkReform,Your daily reminder that any worker's rights movement that excludes women is not a true worker's rights movement,"In 1908, in [Muller v Oregon](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/blog/on-this-day-the-supreme-court-upholds-limits-on-women-and-factory-work-hours), the Supreme Court ruled that women were a protected class that could be subject to laws to protect them. This came three years after a case that upheld that a state could not limit the working hours of a baker to 10 hours per day. 

In some ways, a progressive victory. In other ways, a terrible blow to women workers. 

The early twentieth century was a great time for work reform. We got unions, weekends, 8 hour workdays. And a lot of the rhetoric we used to get those things marginalized and erased women's work. The proverbial worker was a man (specifically a white man, which I will touch on in a future post). He needed shorter hours and the ability to advocate for better pay and working conditions so as to allow himself to care for his wife and children. 

Meanwhile, women have always worked, and it's a complete myth that holds that women were housewives until the 1970s. Only a certain class of women have ever done exclusively housework (which is also work, but again, a future post). Unless you don't count laundresses, farmer's wives, maids, cooks, enslaved women workers, rag pickers, street vendors, factory workers and countless others as women. And I think Sojourner Truth already covered that issue so let's put it to bed. 

I post this because even now I see this sort of rhetoric in modern discourse about labor: people opining about how a man needs to not work 80 hours to support his wife, for instance. And the insistence by some in various political spheres that the parts of the Build Back Better bill that cover childcare are somehow not related to labor, or worker's rights.

It is long past time to cast off the chains of misogyny, anti-immigrant bias, and racism in movements seeking labor equality and justice. Let's start by discarding the idea that a worker is a man, and only a man.

Edit: removed the mention of this sub because I don't really have an interest in calling out particular ocmmenters with whom I mostly agree anyway but it seems that keeping in the mention is mostly going to result in defensiveness.

704,1am2fpl,2024-02-08,WorkReform,This Economy needs Reform and more workers rights (the job hunt is utter hell),"Even John Locke would balk if he saw capitalism today. I'm pretty sure that he didn't envision a society where even the brightest and best and motivated couldn't succeed at being gainfully employed.

I have a full bachelors degree, and most of another, I have been working in professional office fields since I was legally able to work, got amazing grades in school, volunteer, work on side projects. Have specialized experience in niche things that are ""very in demand"". Since starting my current job that I'm being laid off from, I have gone above and beyond and obtained more certifications, more experience, and spent 50+ hours of my week on work and professional development. And I was recently rejected for a position that required one year of work experience and one bachelors degree. As a shortage position. (Keep in mind that I have been in the work force in relevant fields for many years--software and social sciences), I never had kids young, I constantly worked hard, I learned more languages, took internships, took low paying jobs, constantly strove to improve above and beyond. I am open to in person work and remote work (all I want is a livable wage and career growth (I am open to technical low middle income jobs too), health insurance, and PTO like any full time job SHOULD have.).

Meanwhile, my mother is in the market with impeccable experience (over 30+ years of it) in the relevant field, degreed, and beyond capable. In the medical field. She isn't getting hired either. A few of my high school friends got degrees in CS from Ivy Leagues, others did bootcamps. Some ended up unemployed and so demoralized they ended up in psychiatric inpatient. They worked for places like Amazon and big software dev companies before being laid off. No one is hiring them either. It isn't just this though. My friend who is a mother, has years of experience in cyber security, childcare, and food services could only get part time fast food. My friend who is a father with 4 years of chef experience was turned down at fast food for ""not having enough experience"". My extended family has 20-30 years in their relevant fields and are underpaid by 40K. It doesn't matter if you did everything wrong or everything right, if you worked for no time or 30+ years, the job market is utter hell right now, and Capitalism clearly does not work. Even for people who played by all the rules.

I feel like if you are willing to work, you should be compensated for your labor, you should be valued, and you should be able to find a job in your field, that you meet the minimum requirements for. And frankly, you deserve human rights no matter your employment status. This is getting fucking ridiculous. I'm pretty sure Locke and Marx would have both balked at this shit. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get this off my chest. All workers deserve jobs with living wages, and jobs that they can grow in if they choose to.

TL/DR: Toxic boss stood at the door and shouted about 25 feet across the parking lot that I was 5 minutes late today. I'm salary.

Boss in a nutshell: Passive-aggressive bully, micromanager, zero positive statements/praise  to staff. Only time he laughs is literally at someone else's expense. 

History: I transferred to this location in Feb, because of my spouses' employment opportunity. Have not gotten along with this guy from the start. I do my job, my clients like me and I'm hitting my numbers. We just don't click. He also made an off-color joke in May that referenced my spouse as a hooker, working on a street corner. I had a meeting with him about it and we 'settled it' without anything formal. His boss knows only because I left early the day he made the joke, making it VERY clear why I would not be back for the rest of the day (he panicked and called to get his side of the story to cover his ass)

Current situation: Apparently, he has a pet-peeve of lateness. I live very close (this is partly why I haven't just quit or transferred yet) and if I hit one slow driver etc I end up being a few minutes late. Well, Friday I got stuck behind a slow truck and was a whole 5 minutes late. Before I could even get out of my car, he was standing in the parking lot. Made a big show of looking at his watch and shouted ""Great job,  only 5 minutes late today""

I had had enough and shouted back ""Please don't make any more passive-agressive comments. If you want to write me up, then write me up.""

""Oh, it's coming"" and he storms off.

I am a salary employee. I don't get paid extra when I stay late and I'm not sure any upper management are going to give a squirt if I'm 3-5 minutes late every day as long as my numbers are good. I've worked at 3 other locations that didn't care if I showed up 20 minutes late. There are other issues here beyond the lateness, this guy is a bully and he's creating a really toxic work environment. What do I do?

Edit: I am not asking for advice on how to be on time, I will no longer be late and this is not the issue. This is merely the latest example of how this bully/micromanager users anything to read me the riot act.",robbypants,t2_i6ip2,0.97,1284,269
706,11qi6o8,2023-03-13,WorkReform,How to tackle Pay gap at my work,"Hi! 

 I work at an A/V company. Started 5 months ago. Around the same time, a woman was hired for the same position. I learned soon that I make 3 dollars an hour more. 

 I told another coworker who has been there longer and he said that it could make sense. I'm 29, she's 18. I have more experience and a relevant degree in Audio. She doesn't. 

 Still we do the same job, so should be the same pay but whatever. 

 Then I found out that one of our recent hires, a man, also 19, makes 2 dollars an hour more than her. So now it's pretty clearly a case of paying her less cuz she's a woman. 

 Question is, what's the best way to tackle this? Honestly I don't even mind if this will lose me the job, if it actually makes some waves either in public or at least to the higher-ups of the company. I just don't wanna lose my job and for nothing to happen and for my mid-level manager who is the only one I deal with to bury the whole thing.

 So what would be the best move?

I work from home remotely for a medical scheduling company. I live and work 90 minutes away from where the office is. Two weeks ago, at home, the laptop I work on got accidentally yanked off my desk by a cable and shattered the screen. I was a bit panicked and spoke with my manager and worked out that the following day, I needed to drive down to get a new laptop - which was fine. But I am a single mother and on that particular day I was to go get it, I temporarily did not have child care for an hour that morning. I told my manager I would be leaving at about 930 in the morning due to no childcare that morning and she was extremely combative and didn’t understand why I couldn’t leave early in the morning and I explained that I didn’t have child care that morning and had to get my kid up, drive almost two hours, etc. She was extremely displeased.

Fast forward to today, I get a notification and phone call from my manager that I am being written up and put on corrective action because of a bad phone call with a client as well as the incident in which I couldn’t get into the office at the hours she felt was best to replace my computer. In the write up she said I had “no sense of urgency” to get in because of the child care situation.

I don’t care that I am being written up for the phone call, but my question is, is it discrimination to come at me because of child care issues I had ONE DAY. This is also the 2nd time they have gotten on my case about my child and my child care situation, the first time being a year ago with something unrelated but in that incident my manager told me verbally “the business comes before your child.”

Seeking negotiation advice.,"My wife should not be essential there in theory, but she absolutely is. It took three people before she got hired to do the job she does now, and she still does it even better. She's the only one in her position right now. She also competently does the jobs of people in other positions whenever they need help, somehow doing it better. They ask her questions about their own jobs. There was a time she left the country for a month and things just fell apart without her. Whenever she asked for raises, they always agreed she deserved one, but acted like her desired amount was too much. The first two were $2 raises and the third time was $1.50 (she requested $2). That, plus a couple of other incidents has her feeling done and she will not be giving up her new job no matter what her old job offers her.

However, we anticipate they will ask her to stay because she's so essential. She figures she would be okay working on weekends if the deal is sweet enough, but we're not sure what's reasonable to demand. Any negotiation advice?

  
EDIT: Thank you for the advice everyone. I want say a couple of things after having read your responses.

  
-She definitely won't be telling her boss where she found new work at.

  
-She's not trying to negotiate with the purpose of staying at her old job. She is 100% determined to move onto her new job no matter what gets offered. She was just considering staying to work on the weekends for extra money. Nothing about having a soft heart (though she does have one). If they can't offer her what she wants, then she's out of there completely.

I will try to make this as short as possible while being intentionally vague for privacy reasons.

TLDR:  I took on the management role on the ICU floor and turned it around. A year later a relative of a higher-up takes over and it all goes to hell in less than a day. I’m also fired but I’ll be just fine.

I’m an ICU nurse at a very large hospital. Our hospital is part of a group of hospitals with majority ownership some hedge-fund. They will spend $100 dollars to save $5 dollars because some efficiency expert had to justify his existence. It’s that type of place.

About a year ago we went through our third floor manager because we couldn’t retain staff, the staff that was there would often call-out and training costs were through the roof due to constant churn of staff. There were lots of problems but those were the big ones.

One day corporate came down on a Friday afternoon to let us know that the floor manager had quit and could some of us help cover until a replacement can be found. Me and another nurse said we would split the duties if we also split what the floor manager was making in salary. They said no, we both passed and on the Monday morning we were called to a meeting in a beautiful board room that was so opulent it was obscene. They tried to pressure us into being “team players” blah, blah. The other nurse excused herself and didn’t come back. She’s near retirement age and crusty as all hell and I love her to bits.

When I got up to leave they had a change of heart. I assumed they were just going to pull someone from the hospital network to do it but it turns out our floor is a problem for them and nobody wants it because it’s career suicide. You can’t meet goals, won’t advance and eventually be replaced. So could I do it for three months and I will get the full pay during that time. I have a master’s degree but it’s in MSN Acute Care NP not a MBA. Thus they won’t be able to offer the position permanently because even if I get results I’d still be unqualified for the position according to corporate guidelines. I accept. After reviewing the standard contract I notice the bonuses for achieving certain metrics.

By the time I make it back to my floor I’m being congratulated by my coworkers for being their new “boss”. This won’t be awkward at all (sarcasm) and it will be even worse transitioning back when it’s over but I was determined to clean the place up for my team and I saw it as a three month job. Not an audition but just 90 days to fix problems.

Because I was there every day I already knew what the majority of the problems were. Staff wasn’t happy. Nobody got a raise post-pandemic because too much was being spent on training new staff. I had a budget and intended on using all of it. I couldn’t increase their base pay but I could offer bonuses and I did that. I also made sure all of the financial changes expired before the three month contract expired so whatever promise I made wouldn’t be canceled by whoever replaced me.

I then asked everyone to fill-out their ideal schedule. We work 12hr shifts 7am-7pm, 7pm-7am. Chose the shifts and days you want to work, cross-out the shifts you don’t want to work then leave blank the ones you’re open to working if your preferred shift isn’t available. It wasn’t a coincidence that the nurses called-out on the shifts they crossed-off so it didn’t make sense to schedule them for shifts they didn’t want. Our previous floor manager over-hired because we had so much turn-over and I was now faced with cutting hours. Well that problem was solved when some nurses wanted to go to part-time status as they were getting burnt-out. They were previously told they couldn’t because we were short and it turns out that’s why some of the previous nurses quit. They were refused part-time because we were short-staffed so management thought it was better for them to just quit. I guess that’s what a MBA teaches? I also paired up experienced nurses with new hires in a buddy system. I used the new hire training budget to focus on mentoring and retaining new hires instead of grinding them up and replacing them. Vet nurses would get a small bonus to mentor new hires. New hires were given the support they needed and the vet nurses got to work with someone who is too new to be jaded. It worked out for everyone.

The first two weeks had a few hitches that were quickly worked out. By week three I was no longer getting calls at home. At week four instead of posting the next two week schedule I posted the next two months. Nobody had a crossed-out shift they didn’t want and everyone had a couple of shifts that wasn’t ideal but was fine. We haven’t had a call-out in three weeks at this point and everyone got a minor bonus. The amount was trivial but it was appreciated. The feedback on the new schedule was overwhelmingly positive. One mom with a special needs child hugged me because she could schedule appointments with the specialist instead of calling-out the day of the appointment. I don’t have kids and didn’t really consider stuff like this so it’s a learning experience for me. If you want to know what’s important to someone just ask them.

As the three months were coming to a close I went back up to the opulent office. We had zero call-outs after the first week. We had two people late once due to a big accident on the freeway. Our retention was 100% with one nurse about to leave on maternity and she wouldn’t have to be replaced as she was only working one shift a week. Two of the nurses who had quit have applied to come back. I felt really good and was happy to go back to my old job despite nearly tripling my pay for the last three months.

Bombshell. Corporate likes the numbers and can I stay on for another three months? Yes. By the end of those three months things are running smoothly so while I will take the salary I also work some shifts because I’m bored and I want to make the transition back a bit easier.

It happens again, another three month extension. Now I’m working three 12hr shifts a week plus the salary position. Things are going well.

Happens again, we still have almost no call-outs, I think one late and we had to replace two nurses. One retired and the other had to move to another part of the state because her husband was having a hard time finding work. Zero rage quit/walk-outs in the now year. We have nurses for ICU’s in the network who want to transfer here where we used to be considered (excuse the use of this word but it’s what we were called, “ghetto”).

So replay the scene, opulent office, now doing the job for 12 months and things are different. Starting July 1st I will be returning to my role in the ICU and someone else will be taking this job. This person who I will call Karen is some distant relative of somebody and is more qualified. Fine, I knew the day would come and it was a fun ride. They then informed me that our department hit our goals for the first time in 18 years but unfortunately could not pay me the bonus for hitting the goals as I was unqualified to fill the position. I then asked if they could send that to me in writing so I can have a labor attorney explain that to me before we go to court. Then things got real quiet.

They asked if I’d be available to bring Karen up to speed on the new systems I implemented. I said yes, my consulting fee is $90/hr with a three hour minimum. Double after 11pm and on weekends. They said she is more than qualified and wouldn’t need that. Again, silence. So I got up and thanked them for the last 12 months and wish Karen good luck for me.

July 1st I’m back doing what I used to do but it’s real awkward. Karen doesn’t know anything about medicine but does now how to make things efficient. First thing she does is drop the bonus system. Then she changed the schedule to a standardized rotating schedule that will be posted two weeks in advance. She has zero social intelligence and treats people poorly. Even the ones that wanted to give her a chance. For example she yelled at a nurse for taking too long to chart a complex patient. Nurses chart everything. It’s a contemporaneous record of what happened to a patient and if we ever end up in court its part of the official record. Nurses and the hospital rely on good charting to stay out of malpractice suits.

The first day isn’t over and it’s already a mess. Previously booked vacation time is cancelled. Mandatory meetings even if it’s your day off. Etc, etc. People coming up to me to see if I can fix it, I can’t. At shift change the new nurses are getting the 411 on Karen and it’s clear a revolt is brewing. As I’m leaving Karen asks me to come to HER office. Word is emphasized because that’s how she said it. Yeah, that put me in my place. She says that she doesn’t like the staff coming to me and she thinks it’s better if I transfer out. I had already planned on leaving as I fully intended to sue for my bonus anyways but I didn’t want to make this easy. So I said she’s the boss and has authority to fire me if she thinks there’s cause. She took the bait, very thin skinned and impulsive. Not one to think things through. So she says, “you’re fired”. I say I’m going to need that in writing. So she gets a blank piece of paper and writes, “your fired” on it. I hand it back and say I need a date and your signature on it. At this point she’s turning red but does it.

I leave and there are four nurses in the hall waiting for me. I let them know I’ve just been fired. They say she can’t do that she has to go through the union. I say I know with a huge shit-eating grin and we walk out to go for some drinks.

A friend I went to school with is an administrator at another hospital that is farther away but a shorter commute as it’s out of the city and has been trying to hire me for a few years. I called and I can start whenever I want. I’m going to take a few weeks. First I’m filing for unemployment. I have an appointment with a labor attorney on July 5. After the phone interview he said if I have the old contract in writing and the you’re fired sheet in writing this is an open and shut case. No charge but he’s getting 30% of what I win. With unused vacation time payout, severance, wrongful dismissal and breach of contract I’m expecting a nice chunk.

I made sure the nurses who also wanted out would have nice references from their peers and supervisors (Not Karen) so they will have an easy exit if they want it.

I did get some good cop/bad cop calls on my voice mail asking if I’d consider coming back and working a “two week notice”. And how unprofessional it was to just quit like that without giving any notice. I didn’t pick up or return calls but I did email the entire management team a simple note that I did not quit, I was fired without cause and sent a scan of the note saying as much with Karen’s signature on it.

UPDATE #1  TLDR:  6 nurses have quit since Monday, I met my lawyer and I'll get what I'm owed and maybe a little bonus.  I start my new job on Monday and all is good.

Hi folks I’m really overwhelmed by the support I’ve received and there’s no way I can respond to the 500+ comments but I have read all of them and gave you all an upvote. Including the people who believe my lived experience is fake. That’s ok I’ll still have solidarity with you but it was funny. One said my writing is so good it must be fake while another said my writing was bad so it must be fake. Others just said fake because that’s what you do on the internet and some don’t believe it’s plausible. I envy those people who can’t conceive of a workplace like this. Big hugs to you and I hope you never experience it.

To the massive amount of people who have experienced it big hugs to you as well. You or someone close to you in whatever field they are in. Given how many have tried to guess the Hospital network it’s clear that what I went through was not unique.

Also I’m a cis female. There was a question and misgendering with some of the comments. Male is still the default setting. No hard feelings to anyone just wanted to clear it up.

Why didn’t I mention I was a combat medic? It wasn’t relevant with maybe one exception. When going into work means there’s a good chance someone will be shooting at you or planting a IED on a body you may be working on it’s pretty scary. Not as scary as a gunnery sergeant chewing you out for poor weapon discipline but it’s close. So old dudes in expensive suits in a luxury office isn’t intimidating. Wealth and power may cow some people but it doesn’t faze me. Now doing an IV start on a exsanguinated patient that’s impressive.

There was also some comments about I did everything perfect and all the other characters were incompetent. It would be good to get other people’s perspective etc.

Yes when we write our accounts on what happened to us you get one point of view on a story. By definition it has to be biased because as writers we’re not reporting from a 3rd party neutral perspective and taking time to give other people’s point of view or motivation. But I will try to do that now.

The big wigs weren’t evil. Their job is to maximize profits and externalize costs. In their eyes I was far from perfect and I will give some examples to illustrate that.

I requested some expensive equipment for the unit. A portable x-ray machine and two lifts one portable and one fixed to help move and rotate bariatric patients. The portable lift and x-ray could be shared in other departments. They only cited the cost and that those things weren’t “needs”. Asking for “luxury” items is discouraged.

They also wanted me to write up every employee for every infraction. That means document a verbal warning and get at least two written warnings to every employee. This would make it easier to dismiss someone if they need to do so.

I didn’t do that to anyone. For example there was a nurse who messed up an arterial line insertion. It was a bit of a mess, a bit of a cost involved but the patient was fine. The nurse didn’t need to be scolded or disciplined; she needed practice in radial artery cannulation. So she made a learning plan. Studied the theory, explained the theory to me, and walked me through the procedure when I was doing it so I knew that she knew the steps. Then she did one while I observed and did it perfectly. Then she had to do nine more observed and get the learning plan signed. When I left she was teaching the new hires how to do it.

She didn’t screw up the line because she was lazy or obstinate. Discipline wouldn’t make her a better nurse. To be honest she and I never got along. Nothing happened it was just a personality clash. After this incident we’re good friends and hang out socially. But management was pissed that she didn’t get a written warning for this egregious behavior.

Another example is they didn’t want me to authorize overtime for anyone but the brand new nurses because they were paid less and overtime is time and a half. In our hospital we have 2 nurses for 4 patients and I always paired an experienced nurse with a new nurse for what I hope is obvious reasons. They didn’t like that and I have the ass chewing emails to prove it but that policy continued until I left. Sorry for legal purposes, I was fired without cause.

Regarding Karen. It’s going to be hard to be objective on this but I’ll try. She’s older than me, has been with the company for a long time and in management for a long time. She requested the job because we went from a dumpster fire to the second most profitable department (after OR) in the hospital. Bonuses are based on how much profit you make. Remember we’re not there to provide healthcare. Healthcare is what we do to make profit. If people really knew how healthcare worked in the US we’d have Medicare for All already. Anyways I had the one interaction with her and I now know of several other interactions other have had since. She might be really good at something but working with people won’t be one of those things and I’ll leave that at that.

Ok on with the update.

I met my lawyer Wednesday morning. He’s kind of a character so for everyone who thinks this is all fake I’m giving you some ammunition now but it’s all true. His office is above a pastry shop. It’s a walk up so if he has a disable client he uses the shop. The furniture is well-worn and the chair I sat in had a hole in it. He wore jeans and an A-team t-shirt.  Not sure if it was really old or one of the retro ones. He asked if I wanted something to drink and my options were soda (I think Tab but might be wrong) or water. I chose water and it was out of the tap served in a coffee mug. The mug said, “I make rich people cry”. I tried to steal it but no dice. He specializes in labor and housing. He does own a tie (I asked). It’s a tie, like as in one tie. Same one every time.

I’m looking around the office and imagining the office of the corporate lawyers and thinking exactly how fucked I am right now. That thought went away as we were talking. Turns out he’s super smart. Grew up very poor, went to city college and night school not an Ivy and really hates capitalists. I found a new friend. Anyways my case is a bit more complicated than I thought. First I should say that I showed him the post. I had not looked since I posted and was kind of shocked at the views. He asked me if there was anything I wrote that I couldn’t defend in court or was untrue. There wasn’t. So he’s fine with it.

Anyway he broke the case down as follows.

1. The bonus. This is a simple paper case meaning there is no need for witnesses or further evidence. A contract was signed, terms agreed upon and they’re reneging after the terms were met. Simple. But the contract stipulates we have to go to binding arbitration that always favors the employer so there’s always a chance to get shived. Can I prove that I met the terms? Yes, I do a lot of work from home so everything is on my laptop. He pulls out two zip drives and I download everything on each. He puts one in the safe and we load up the other as I show him the reports. The charts and math are mine but the data used to calculate the metrics were theirs so there’s no way to fudge this. We’re not contesting anything other than the bonus as they were free to replace me when they did.
2. If they had simply dismissed me when I was running the department they wouldn’t have been in violation. As it stands they can only fire if found guilty of w*illful misconduct, willful neglect of duty or they face a penalty.* *Our union isn’t that strong so I doubt it will be very much.* *The willful misconduct could have been a factor when I was in management but not in the nurse role.* *This won’t go to court but it will go to arbitration.* *My lawyer wants to subpoena and depose everyone and I’m looking forward to it.*
3. *I have outstanding vacation pay and am owed a severance based on the time I’ve worked for the company and it’s an amount worth fighting for.* *I’m told this is also open and shut*

I’m also told that my employment contract states the arbitration is under the “English Rule” which states the losing party pays the legal fees of the winning party so instead of the 30% contingency fee he will get paid by them. He sent a registered letter of “intent to sue” if the contractual obligations of #1 and #3 aren’t met and a settlement amount for #2. They don’t have to pay me for #1 and #3 until the 12th of this month so they aren’t technically in breach yet. They could in theory pay it and we only go to arbitration for #2 where I present the “your fired” (yes it was not spelled correctly) paper. Of all these things the wrongful dismissal is by far the smallest amount. They would pay far more in lawyer fees than it would cost to pay it. So the big bad corporation won’t be getting hosed for doing a bad thing just paying what was already owed with a small slap added to it. So that’s where the legal stuff stands.

I did not file for unemployment as the pay was only $362 a week and nurses have lots of options when it comes to work. Nurses reading this or really anyone in any profession. Learn to network, have as many contacts as possible because you’ll never know when you’ll need them or they’ll need you. If you’re a nurse consider travel nursing for a year. I did it and it was great. You get to meet new people and see how things work or don’t work in a variety of places. I start my new job on Monday. It’s not a lv1 Trauma center but it has an ICU, it’s a shorter drive as it’s out of the city, safer area and a small bump in pay. I’m not running anything just a staff NP. If something comes up in the future who knows but the last thing anyone should do when starting in a new place is try to make changes before they figure out how and why things are done the way they are.

As I stated in the original post I wanted to make sure all the staff had contact information, references and offered help with CV’s if they needed it. Turns out some did. In the last five days six nurses have quit. Four without notice. I should state here that for anyone with “quit and watch it burn-down and crumble” fantasies that is just not reality. That place will be just fine. They will continue to make an obscene amount of money. They will continue to serve their patients. It will simply be as it was before. A toxic work environment, high staff turnover and life goes on. No delusions of grandeur here. I’ll be fine, they’ll be fine. But because of people quitting they did have to shut down 2 ICU beds on Tuesday and 4 ICU beds on Wednesday. Each ICU bed bills about 40k per day depending on the equipment needed to support the patient using the bed so that’s an average. So in terms of revenue (not profit) that is about $240k not being billed. That dwarfs anything they would have to pay me. Lastly and most importantly that is 2 and 4 patients who didn’t get an advanced level of care.

I don’t know all of the reasons why they quit but I can say what I was told.

On July 1st I was fired and there was a two month schedule posted. Karen posted the new schedule to start July 9th and it didn’t work for two people so they quit.

One new hire was being picked on for being too slow and on her second day she broke down and didn’t finish her shift. I understand someone took over care of her patients but this type of thing shouldn’t happen. Quit after your shift. There is a duty to patients that supersedes whatever else is going on.

Two nurses were getting hassled because, “our O2 cost is through the roof”. I should state that there is a significant cost using oxygen but that’s not where you cut costs because alveoli must be ventilated and perfused. Also our costs were at a three year low but that’s because we have less Covid patients not because I’m awesome.

Karen wanted them to use room air instead of the pure oxygen. Behind each bed there are two nozzles. One for O2 and the other for room air. The breaking point was one of the patients were being moved to a medicine floor because they didn’t need to be in the ICU. The shift was over and they were just waiting for a bed to open on the medicine floor. Karen wanted the nurse to go to the medicine floor and take an oxygen tank from them. When we transfer a patient that requires O2 we attach them to a tank on the bed so they can breathe while being transferred. Every floor has tanks for this purpose but Karen wanted to use their tank and a yelling match began resulting in the vet nurse and the new hire she was paired with both quitting on the spot.

So apparently things are going just swell over there. It’s been less than a week.

I also want to say that I have nothing against anyone with a MBA.  You all took a big bite of a shit sandwich in the comments and that was not intentional.  I don't know if it was deserved or not but if you're a worker I have solidarity with you regardless of the letters behind the name.

Anyways again this was a long read and I will update if and when I have news on the settlement. I’ll stay out of the gossip moving forward.

Be kind, be awesome and take care.",BakerLovePie,t2_4fu8yfz5,0.97,13160,532
722,xfmk2k,2022-09-16,WorkReform,that time I quit my job and caused two restaurants to go under,"This happened years ago, but I thought you guys might like it. 

In college, I worked in a counter serve/delivery restaurant. 

This place was gross. It had a serious mouse problem and the personal hygiene standards were low. We were constantly understaffed, and the owner preferred it that way. 

The owner was a pretty big skeeze ball. He would never actually come to the restaurant, but he was quick to call and berate us if there was a customer complaint. He always sided with the customer. I watched him make more than one person cry. 

Keep in mind too, this was a man in his 50s calling to fully scream at 19-22 year old girls. 

A lot of times, we would pass the phone back to the guys in the kitchen, because he wouldn't yell at them. He'd let them explain what happened. 

We were supposed to call him with any problems, but after 5pm, he was wasted and we knew better than to call him while he was drunk. 

He did show up one time to bring us bread from the second location during dinner rush. I was 19 and he drunkenly hit on me the whole time he was in the building. He was married. 

I worked there for three years. I moved up to assistant manager after a year and then night manager a few months later.

The pay was abysmal for in house, but we took most of the abuse. We made $7/hr + tips, which came out to less than $10 a night - we were counter serve and didn't expect a lot of tip money at all. The kitchen staff made $14/hr + in house tips, and the delivery drivers made $7/hr +  their delivery tips (which averaged $100+/shift). We were told to always give the kitchen the biggest share of tips. When I became a manager, they raised my pay to $10/hr, but only did so when I told the gossip mill I was interviewing for other jobs, and I had to agree to work Sundays. I'd previously told them I wasn't available on Sundays because I spend it with my family and used it to study. When they took that away, I would write my papers on my phone during slow times, but once they figured that out, they made me start cutting the other FoH employee and run the FoH by myself for the last two hours of the night. 

I started getting really disgruntled, but I tried to stick it out for the last few months before I graduated. 

Three things happened within two weeks of each other that made me quit the week of my finals. 

1 - one of the cashier's quit. This left three of us to cover morning and evening shifts - morning manager, night manager, and a floater. The morning manager was going out of town the day before my graduation, and the owners tried to force me to miss my graduation ceremony to work. I told them I wasn't going to show up for work that day.
 

2 - the owner decided to repair the ceiling but not close the store. The ceiling was constantly leaking, leading to us being unable to put food in several locations, otherwise ceiling water would leak in. I was yelled at several times for throwing out food that had gotten water in it. They didn't see a problem with serving some ceiling water to customers. 

The day they repaired the ceiling, I walked in store and immediately got dizzy from fumes. I had to go outside to catch my breath several times. I watched ceiling debris fall into the salad line and the cooks didn't throw the contaminated food out. I called the owner and told him we couldn't serve food under these conditions - to which he screamed at me. 30 minutes into my shift, he called back and told me to go home for the night if I was so uncomfortable. I did. 

3 - the floater cashier screamed at me. 
I don't blame her so much as I do the stress we were under. The owner had put a limit on how much we could order in supplies per day, which this led to corners being cut. They quit ordering the correct amount of supplies for FoH, so this meant that we had to do prep work for that day as soon as the supplies order came in rather than doing it during down time that night. Before it was night shifts responsibility, but now it has been put entirely on day shift. 

I came in that morning to train a new employee. The floater cashier saw me and started screaming at me for not doing any prep work the night before.

The entire staff stopped and watched as I turned around, clocked out and never came back. I later texted the BoH and morning manager to list out why I'd quit. 


The aftermath: 
A week after I quit, the morning manager and the BoH manager put in their two weeks. The three of us had kept that store running for years. We propped it up and took blame for things that weren't our fault, but rather a consequence of a decision made by the owner. 

With no managers, the owner closed the second location permeantly and sent that staff to work at the main store. 

The shop bled employees. People left so fast, they didn't even have time to hire any replacements. 

This meant the owner and his wife had to come in and work. 

While I was there, we ran four different online ordering systems - Postmates, ChowNow, GrubHub, and DoorDash. We'd begged the owners to scale back, but they refused. If anyone has seen ""The Bear"" - it was literally that. We'd have 30+ orders before we even opened for the day. I'm not kidding when I say 5 years later, I still have nightmares about those tablets going off during lunch rush. 

Within days of the owners coming in, all four systems were taken down, and you could only order over the phone. 

The owners had been setting up another business - a bakery - and were a month away from opening. They had to cancel the opening and break their lease.

I filed for unemployment, because in my state you can draw it for being forced to quit an ""intolerable work environment"". My claim was rejected and I appealed. This meant I had to be on a call with the owner and a mediator. The owner's wife was on the call and she screamed at me, which led to the mediator siding with me and I was able to draw unemployment until I found a job with my degree. 

They got divorced three months later. 

So, yeah. That's the story of how I quit and subsequently cause two stores to close and a divorce. They remodeled the store recently and the inside scoop is that they're planning on selling it to the first buyer they can get.


Edit:

TL;DR: I worked in a restaurant that was really gross and the owner was never around, but would call us to scream at us. They served contaminated food and cut corners, so I quit. They were forced to close down two stores, the owners had to work in store after the other managers quit, and then they got divorced. 

Thanks for the awards! Glad you guys enjoyed my story.

Edit #2: 


Writing this post inspired me to reach out to some of my old coworkers, and I found out some pretty juicy information - 

In the last few months, they fired all delivery drivers and now use a third party delivery service. This broke my heart, because several of the delivery drivers worked there since the doors opened, yet the owner had no loyalty to them. 

Employees staged a walk out because the owner hadn't cut checks to two of the employees in over a month. (waiting on more info about the specifics of that.) The store was closed for a week before the employees were paid, but several quit, and the store has been unable to open several times because they lacked employees. 

Word of the employee walk out spread to the local college campus. The store is within walking distance of the dorms and had partnered with the college to accept meal plan money. The restaurant also did several thousands of dollars in catering orders a month for this college. After the employee walk out, students rallied and convinced the student activities board to no longer order catering. Whether or not the college will continue to allow meal plan money to be spent there is very up in the air. 

What these employees and students did is insanely brave. Employees stood up for their fellow coworkers and students called on their university to stop ordering from a place that didn't value their employees.

That's my wife. Now we live in Korea, where there are no laws against racism, or discrimination or anything like that. My wife is also black. 

Well over the last few years my wife has made a name for herself in her school, her student parents LOVE HER. The parents love my wife SOOO MUCH the school has literally EXPANDED because of my wife. They had to lease a new building because of my wife. My wife is also probably one of the highest paid people in her position because I've helped her leverage her success for higher salary.

Anyway the school ownership is broken down between three owners Owner A owns 60% owner B owns 25, owner C owns 15%.

The division my wife works for is managed by Owner B. Owner B was recently moved to be the manager. Very quickly my wife noticed that Owner B treated her very rudely, wouldn't include in her news and updates she needed to know about. On a few occasions made racial remarks. My wife had enough, found a new job, and went to Owner A to quit.

Owner A who loves my wife, did not want her to quit. So they had a heart to heart between my wife and the three owners. And my wife made it very clear that she would not keep on working under Owner B. That if that didn't change she would quit, and there was nothing they could do to stop her.

So the owners had a meeting, and it was basically decided that Owner B would become a silent partner and no longer involved in the day to day operations. Its rumored Owner B wanted 3x payout for her stake in the business and Owner B and C weren't willing to do that, however they were able to essentially ""fire her"" from her managing duties.

One problem

Whose going manage the division? My wife comes home and tells me ""Owner B is no longer a manager, and is simply an owner, and won't be managing the school anymore and they are looking for a new head teacher (which is basically a manager of all the teachers plus someone that teaches)

So I recommended to my wife since she had an HR degree, that she go to Owner A and ask for the position along with a heathy raise. Make the agruement that you already run a great program, you have proven to be successful, also you have excellent HR experience (My wife was previously the head of HR at large construction company) and the education to back up it up.

So Owner A and C agreed she will become the new head teacher. Owner A also agreed to her salary suggestion. My wife is earning about $500 more a month then any head teacher I've ever ran across. 
\
My wife agrued that between her creativity in her lesson plans, her HR experience, her experience with children, the number of children she's brought in the school, and the growth she's caused for her employer she deserves nothing less. Also my wife (and her school knows this) doesn't need to work. She works cause she wants too, so if they don't give her what she wants, she walks.

She's already begun to implement a new policy, sometimes they have children with behavioral issues, they are likely either on the spectrum, have ADHD or some other issue.

This is one of the comments I made. Three people used the laughing reaction. One being the wife of one of the owner's at the company my Dad works. My Dad is that company.


 He is destroying his body to ""work"" for the company. He is paid salary and never gets over time even though he probably works anywhere from 10-14 hours a day. Sadly, my Dad has an old school mindset that men are suppose to work hard to provide. I love my Dad, but he is stubborn, hard headed, and not the smartest man I ever met. Anywhere he has ever worked he has always been under paid and his employers have always taken advantage of him. 


This company took out 250k in PPP loans when they were available. They didn't even give my Dad a Christmas the same year. They also never stopped operating during covid, so the PPP loan was unnecessary. 

I needed somewhere to rant because I was struggling with holding my tongue. The situation just makes me so sad because I am watching him deteriorate before my eyes. He is getting old (59) and will not be able to do this kinda hard labor forever. 

Even more sad, when he comes home he just sits in front of the TV brain dead, watching Fox News, and yelling at the TV. Blaming Democrats for his struggles. He has nothing to show for the 40+ years he's been in the same industry destroying his body. My parent don't even own there house.

Soon after I started, they implemented time clocks for the whole office. I thought that was weird because, again, I was supposed to be salaried. I let it go. 

Not long after that my boss starts telling me that HR is giving her shit because I sometimes clock in anywhere from 1-5 minutes late. (My commute is ~40 minutes so sometimes I get stuck in traffic, etc) Despite me always making up those minutes at the end of the day by not clocking out until ~4:10, they said staying late didn't count towards making up those minutes. I thought it was dumb again, but I let it go.

A couple of months ago, my dad dies. I ran out my PTO in order to deal with it. They continually gave me shit for running my PTO dry and sometimes going a little bit over. They show no empathy towards me throughout this.

Because I didn't want to give them anymore ammunition against me, i started making sure I left 10 minutes earlier than I should. So I clock in around 10 minutes early every day. But, I make sure I clock out exactly at 4pm now.

A couple of weeks ago I am told that I need to start emailing the receptionist every time I leave the building for my break. This pissed me off, but I did it.

Cut to my performance review yesterday - my boss makes it clear that I have performed extremely well and have managed to significantly improve the financial systems of the the company. That I am vital to this company. Great!

Until.. She brings up that people are noticing that I'm eating lunch at my desk, and then taking my 30 minute break. I usually will munch something at my desk before going on break because I would go on a walk or something instead of waste my time pick up fast food. Here's where I LOST IT. 

I asked her to clarify - am I not allowed to eat at my desk? She says I am allowed. So I press further for her to very clearly explain the rules, so that I could follow them. She couldn't. Because they make ZERO sense.

Then she starts bringing up reasons why they think I'm not working when I should be, the main one being that I leave exactly at 4pm every day. She says ""you have a reputation around here for leaving right when your shift ends"". I told her ""Good! I'm proud to have that reputation! Although it doesn't make any sense since I'm consistently here 10 minutes early""

I was just dumbfounded. I lost my cool. I fought back against every single thing I listed here, and got her to agree that none of them have any basis in actual policy, and is not standardized across the company.

741,148q2qv,2023-06-13,WorkReform,Employer 'reclassified' me to not pay my salary during Jury Duty,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons...

And sorry in advance, this is gonna be a long one.

So to give some context to this whole situation - I live in the US and I have worked at my current company over 5 years and have always been salary. I have never been paid overtime and have almost always worked more than 50 or 60 hours each week. I am in a management-type position, where I oversee a handful of employees.

Onto the situation:

A while back, I got summoned for Jury Duty - I went to the jury selection over a couple of days, and I wound up getting selected. The case was scheduled to take multiple weeks, and there would be one day a week that court was not in session, meaning I would still be able to go to work at least one day per week, along with whatever other work I could accomplish during lunch breaks or before/after court. 

When being being questioned by the judge, I did not have any reason that I should be dismissed (personal financial hardship), because at the time, I was under the impression that I would still be paid, as I am a salary employee, not hourly, so the trial would not be an issue (financially) for me.

After being selected for the jury, I informed my supervisor and that the trial could potentially be multiple weeks. No issues... I'm guessing, he then informed our HR / Office Manager, who then promptly looked up the law on whether or not they are obligated to pay me for Jury Duty. In my state, employers are not required to pay for jury duty, but again, I am salary and would still be working a minimum of one day per week, so federal law dictates I do still get paid. 

So to say I was surprised the next morning when I was informed I would NOT be paid during Jury Duty, is an understatement. The company had always taken care of other workers - paying for them while in the hospital or helping them out personally. So even if the 'law' didn't require it, based on past actions, I at least expected to be paid my normal pay, because it's not like I would be completely disappearing - I would still be in the office at least 1 day a week and working between breaks and other times to accomplish my tasks.

Later that same day, the big boss talked to me about being paid for the hours I worked, essentially turning me into a hourly employee - asking me to track hours and I would be paid the hours I worked... That is NOT how was hired or classified, and was never part of my contract or anything in my hiring documents... 

Needless to say, I was pissed - I went home and did my research and found out way too much about labor laws and all that jazz. I needed to know what my rights were - is my employer right? All that...

What I found is that based on my duties and the level of position, that I am classified as an 'exempt' employee - meaning I am exempt from receiving overtime pay, which I have not received a CENT of OT my entire time with this company... so yah I check all those boxes. What I also found is that an exempt employee must be paid the full weekly pay even if they only write one email the entire week. The other part is that an employer can only dock pay from an exempt employee if there is justification for it... like the employee going AWOL or being punished for 'intentionally' not completing task (basically poor performance or negligence). An employer cannot dock pay from employee for things outside of their control (like Jury Duty or Military Service).

So, the next work day, I go to our HR department and present my backup as I believe they are wrong in what they told me previously. This is escalated up to the big boss, who then pulls me in to discuss.

The long and short of this discussion came down to:

* He said It's not fair to the company to pay for me only working one day a week
* I also reminded him that I was never planning to only work that one day and would put in what I could in order to keep things running smoothly and that I did expect to paid what I am owed according to the law
* He then said to not come in at all - he won't pay for somebody to work one day a week... which I reminded him was illegal as there is work available and he cannot refuse me work when it is available.
* He left and I guess went to research his own and figure out if he was right or wrong

In the meantime, I had already gotten legal advice from a buddy of mine, who works at a much bigger, publicly traded company that has lawyers on retainer. He talked with their lawyer about an 'employee of theirs' and what their legal obligation is as far as pay, exempt status, all that...

Same conclusion I came to - just confirmed my research and affirmed my stance.

Later, the big boss came back and pretty much told me 'how wrong I was'... and that I am not an exempt employee and that the position I have needs to require a degree to be considered 'exempt'... which is 1) not true for exempt status works and 2) I do have a degree anyways....

From that one, out of context snipit he got from our payroll company, he thought he was 100% right and that I am a non-exempt employee. Fine, except for the fact that I have not ONCE been paid overtime... so he only found the information that supported him, but didn't read into the consequences of that...

At this point in the meeting tho, I was already decided - it is time to go... I would be looking for a new job immediately. So I just sat there... taking the abuse (which was much more than just how 'wrong' I was), letting him think he won. In the end, we just agreed to 'put it behind us'... so that's what I did and started applying for new jobs.

&#x200B;

I also went to the judge and informed him of the situation and asked to be dismissed from the case, as with what my employer's intentions were, I would basically be docked up to 80% of my pay, and now I definitely would be in personal financial hardship. Thankfully, I did get released from the case. 

&#x200B;

I just don't get it - Employers want to have their cake and eat it too... I work insane hours and get nothing from it, yet when I need a few weeks to be covered, it's all of a sudden a problem? I am salary when it is convenient for them, but then have to go hourly because it's not convenient for them??? WTF

This is not how people deserve to be treated at all

&#x200B;

TLDR: Got Jury Duty and boss tried to reclassify me into an hourly employee from a salary employee to avoid paying me during Jury Duty. I refused and it became a big issue - boss thinks he is right and wanted to move past it, which I agreed, but I am now looking for a new job.

I previously worked in a senior living facility as a caregiver and a medication technician. I left the job behind when I started becoming too much for me to handle mentally. I loved working with the residents, and I would do anything for them, but for my own sake, I had to leave. I couldn't handle it anymore. Working in fast food is stressful in its own way, but it's much preferred to what I did before.  


Today, after clocking into a shift, I saw some old co-workers from that place. We didn't exactly get along, but I always did my best to be polite and say hello regardless. Otherwise, we stayed out of each other's ways. They had apparently finished up lunch and were heading out. Later in the day, about 5 hours into my shift, they came in again while I was on my lunch break and sat across from me. They just kept asking questions about why I was doing something that was beneath what I was doing before, even going as far as mocking my co-workers as well. I didn't respond to any of it, just repeatedly asking them to leave. They refused.

&#x200B;

This lasted for about 5 minutes before my manager stepped in asked them to leave. I thanked my lucky stars that she's the kind that doesn't take that kind of harassment lightly. I came back from my lunch and kept working, but I kept getting bothered by how they were so dismissive of other people.

&#x200B;

I just don't really understand the need for them to speak about other working-class people with such disdain. We're all just trying to get by and live our lives the best we can.

Also all international branches have been required to go 3 days a week.

I do not understand how my company always talks about implementing “diversity, equity and inclusion” practices during work and with the books we publish, but is seriously considering forcing employees to work in a place where the average studio apartment rent is $3000 when 30% of my monthly budget for housing is $750 according to my salary.

Manager laughed and played dumb, ""inflation? What's that?"" This was a financial company 🤦‍♂️","Friend booked time with manager to ask for a raise. They stalled for weeks, avoided her, even didn't show up on the agreed upon time. She reminded them about the meeting, they finally held it later in the day.

Manager feigned being busy, what could she possibly want with his time.

She demanded a raise. She hasn't had a raise in over 2 years.

He said ""we're not doing raises this year, why do you think you should get one?""

She outlined that she's been with the company 5 years, she's a good employee -- always on time, never takes sick days, barely goes on vacation, works hard, supports the team, never had complaints about performance.

And she outlines that since her last raise in 2020, she's had an effective ""pay-cut"" as a result of all the inflation in the economy.

Manager feigned laughter and said ""inflation, what's that? Is that like inflammation??""

He legitimately tried to claim he didn't know what inflation was.

This is a dude who is 35+, at a financial company that brokers long-terms loans to home owners -- which means they charge interest rates that need to beat inflation for them to turn a profit.

She gave him a blank stare, like ""you're kidding, right?""

He asked ""well, how much were you expecting?""

She said ""over the last 2 years, there's been inflation of 10% (CPI), so at the minimum I want a 10% raise to keep my salary from being a pay-cut."" 

This would have only brought her spending power to match her salary from two years ago, effectively she wouldn't have seen any additional increase in spending power.

This time he legit laughted, ""there's no way!""

So she said ""I expected as much, here's my two weeks notice.""

On the way out, they also tried to screw her on vacation days, they didn't want to pay-out on her accrued vacation (illegal in this country), even tried to claim she lost a week because it wasn't used by the end of last year. 

She had to print and deliver a copy of the government regulation which clearly showed they can't do that, that they must compensate her for any unused vacation days. They told her ""we'll have to look it over"", but eventually they did pay-out.

Within a week of giving notice, she secured a new job that gave her a 25% salary increase (instead of just the lousy 10% she asked for), this job also includes retirement account matching, immediate health benefits, and allows work from home (her old company was forcing people back into the office full time).

Her new company is one of the best rated employers in the country. While her old company has experienced massive turnover over the last 2 years, especially in the last 6 weeks many senior employees quit, as new management destroyed the company.",PowerToThePanels,t2_fv54cn59,0.99,4492,144

759,ssdxme,2022-02-14,WorkReform,"As a leader in my company's women's inclusion group, I suggested we do a pay audit and got a talking to from legal.","Diversity and inclusion initiatives at companies are skin deep. I'd like to tell you all a story about how I got involved and was told I shouldn't try to make an actual difference in the lives of female employees. It's a bit long, so feel free to skip to the tl;dr. 

Last year, the employee inclusion group for women at my company (of which I was a regional leader) set out our annual priorities. These priorities would be the basis for our events and initiatives over the next year. 

One of our priorities was ""to measure the inequities women face at our company and brainstorm to rectify them."" In my role as a leader of the group, I suggested we put pressure on the company to contract with a third party firm to perform an audit on equitable pay. Since the company always touts how competitive our pay is (the stat they always use is that our median pay is in the 60th percentile of market rate-- so our pay is supposedly 10% than the market average), I thought this could potentially be a slam dunk for the company. I drew up reports based on data from other companies in our industry, and found that the pay disparity for women on average in our industry was about 5%. Not massive, but could potentially make a difference for some people and could be a show of good faith for the company. 

As a marketing person, I always recognize an opportunity for good PR for a company. If the pay audit came back great, than the company could claim empirically that they back up their diversity and inclusion claims with proven equitable pay. If the pay audit came back showing pay disparities, then we'd have our work cut out for us for next steps. I understood having to potentially bump a bunch of peoples' pay would not have been ideal for the company, but I thought my job as a leader in an underrepresented employee group was to put internal pressure on the company and push the needle.

Silly me.

At the time, I thought my suggestion was mildly controversial but that no people in disadvantaged groups (such as women, LGBTQ folks, PoC, etc) would be against it because it would presumably benefit us to either 1) know we're getting paid equitably and fairly or 2) know we're getting paid less than men/white people/straight folk and be able to come up with proposals to rectify the gap. 

However, I did not get the reception I hoped. Minutes after I sent in my proposal for this project, the president of the women's inclusion group sent me a private meeting invite asking to talk about my suggestion. I begrudgingly accepted the invite-- from her language, I knew the vibes were off and she wasn't a fan of my proposal. 

During the meeting, she proceeded to effectively chew me out and told me that the company would never go for it, and that it could create a massive liability for the company in the future. The entire time, I'm sitting there listening to her berate me and wondering how the fuck the head of the women's inclusion group is not interested in advocating for women workers. Throughout the entire meeting, she paused every couple of sentences and said ""do you understand why this not a good idea? I need you to understand."" I nodded mutely and didn't really push back except to reiterate the primary arguments of my proposal. But I knew it would be useless. I could tell from the way she approached our ""conversation"" (it was really more of a lecture) that she wasn't going to budge. 

After the meeting, she made me schedule time with somebody from legal. The woman from legal also chewed me out for about half an hour explaining what a horrible idea a company-wide pay audit was. 

I quit from the women's employee inclusion group leadership board not two weeks later. I was deeply saddened to see that the organization I had worked hard to lead over the last two years was completely uninterested in making a concrete difference in women's lives. I'm not discounting the impact of any of the unconscious bias seminars I put on, the women's mentorship program I participated in, or the visibility I pushed towards the program to grow our membership. However, when it came down to it, women leaders at my company didn't want to help me rock the boat. I was left high and dry.

And the thing is: **I don't blame them.** The threat of losing their job loomed over them. And I guess we can lump me in that category too, because I'm still employed with this company and have simply reverted to trying to make a difference on my team where I'm at. Once I realized I had no backing for this initiative, I layed off of it. So I suppose I'm complicit too. 

I'm tired of workers feeling like they have to shill for the companies they work for. I guess the moral of the story is that tech companies desperately need to unionize if we're ever going to see equitable pay. 


Tl;dr: I advocated for a company wide pay audit in my capacity as a leader of a group that represents women workers at my company. I was shut down-- by the president of the group and legal.",nightlights9,t2_shbiec3,0.93,60,13

Our **LABOR** is the most valuable resource in society. Our **TIME** is the most finite and precious resource.

We must demand legislation that requires businesses to disclose their wage offerings in their ads and when asked. We must approach this matter both in legislation and in our personal approaches. We must demand recruiters and job postings to give us the real salary up-front or else we refuse to do any interview. We must work as a collective and strike against these wicked practices.

This is a long and kinda anticlimactic one, but there’s a fun diversion in the middle to hopefully spice it up, haha. 

Sorry it’s been a couple of days, but I as I’m sure many of you know, this is not going to be a quick process.  However, I wanted to let those interested know where things currently stand. 

**Please note: I am not a lawyer or expert in employment law. None of what is said here is to be interpreted as legal advice.** This is information based on our experiences and I’m sharing it in the hopes that it can be of some help if anyone is else finds themselves in similar circumstances. I am completely open to being wrong on some points and being corrected. This is a confusing, stressful issue to navigate and I’m sure there are details I’m missing. 

Well, on Sunday we had a chance to talk to the coworker who witnessed the most of the “conversation” between my wife and her Former Boss (FB). She confirmed pretty well everything I’ve mentioned in the previous posts, including believing FB had fired my wife. She was really sweet to my wife and showed her she has support.  The friend said FB’s behavior made it clear how tenuous any of their jobs are and will be looking for something better. In the meantime, she’s kinda serving as our mole on the inside. Only as much as she is comfortable with though. We’re not interested in asking her to do anything that would make her life more difficult. 

On Monday we started making calls to labor attorneys. Good grief, it’s difficult to get someone on the phone. We left messages, filled out online contact requests, sent out emails, etc. the few we were able to speak with weren’t able to help us due to distance from our area or not specializing in relevant law. We made a couple of appointments for Tuesday, so we kinda just had to be patient and wait to see if we could learn anything else. 

We have been incredibly grateful to have received so much support and validation, both from this community and from our offline friends and family.

Unrelated good news from Monday: About two weeks ago, our boys found a half-frozen little four-week old kitten stuck in our bushes while they were playing outside with the neighbor kids. Tiny thing could barely move and wasn’t making a sound. My wife took her inside and gave her a gentle warm bath and she just slept in a little blanket for hours.  In the meantime, my wife called our vet and got some advice on how to care for a kitten so young.  That evening, kitty woke up, meowed a couple of times, took a few bites of the kitten food slurry the vet recommended we mixed up, and went immediately back to sleep. 

We weren’t sure what to do though. We have a dog (Buddy) we brought home from the shelter 3 years ago and he really struggles with other animals. He was about 7 years old when we met him and was a stray for an undetermined amount of time before the shelter took him in, so he’s been through some stuff. He’s as gentle as you could ever hope for with people, but he has a very strong prey drive and does exhibit aggression towards other animals.  We’re careful to leash him for walks and have been working with him, but we weren’t sure we would be able to provide a safe home for the tiny kitten.  We decided to carefully see how Buddy would respond, but he had to be our priority and we didn’t want to put him in a situation he couldn’t handle or that would affect how our boys would feel about him. 

I don’t know that I’d say he’s “warmed” to her, but he hasn’t shown any aggression and mostly just tries to ignore her when she gets too close. She gently booped his nose the other evening and, well, have you ever had a dog look at you like you’re insane, all wide-eyed and incredulous, haha.  The biggest struggle we’ve had between the two of them is keeping them away from each other’s food. 

On Monday my wife took both of them to vet, Buddy for his annual shots and kitten for her follow-up, now that we’ve had her for a little bit and she seems to be recovering well.  While the techs were handling the kitten, she was mewling about it quite a bit and was generally displeased with the whole things, so Buddy walked across the room and concernedly but assertively barked at the vet techs until they showed him kitty was okay and let him check on her. So, we’re so pleased to be able to welcome Lucy into our family.  A few pics of Buddy and Lucy are included, if you’re interested. [Little fuzzy siblings](https://imgur.com/a/EpkTNAJ/)

Alright: back to the bullshit at hand. On Tuesday, my wife was able to have an actual conversation with an attorney. She was informed that unfortunately, federal Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) laws don’t apply to employers with less than 15 workers. In order to make a claim for discrimination or harassment under federal law, you have to be able to demonstrate that you’ve suffered because you’re a member of a protected group (race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information). Other than that, you have to rely on state law for protection, and our state doesn’t go any farther than federally required in that regard. For reference, we live in the state famous for first electing the cowardly traitor Mike Pence to political office. So, we’re going to stop stressing about that option and just keep hoping the unemployment claim will be competently investigated.  FMLA laws, while they don’t apply here anyways, don’t come into play until a company has at least 50 employees. 

I am still planning on disclosing the name of the restaurant, but I want to wait until we can speak with the unemployment investigator to ensure that doing so won’t put out claim at risk for retaliation or something like that. 

Please let me know if I’m missing something or if you have any other suggestions. I’ll post another update as soon as there is any more news. Thanks again for reading and coming along on this journey with us this far.",__The__Bedongler__,t2_fz8n2,0.92,91,24

It seemed strange to me because here in Mexico it is required by law employers pay 15 days extra of salary per labored year, it is called ""Aguinaldo"" (I translated it to ""Christmas bonus"" because I don't think there's a direct translation for it in english) - so I looked this up and yeah, by law her employer does not have to pay this.

[Link](https://reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/zf1rdo/update_2_wife_fired_for_calling_off_twice_to_care/) to second update. 

Until yesterday, my wife ran the kitchen at a little bistro/cafe in our town for the past 2 and a half years.  The owners are a married couple whom we have gotten to know well. She has done a hell of a job and since she’s been there, the restaurant has become the #1 rated restaurant in its class in our state.  

Due to the nature of her job and the fact this is a small business (only 3-4 employees and the owners), she has rarely missed days.  Thankfully I have a job that has allowed me to arrange my schedule to work from home on the vast majority of days when our kids have had to be home during school weeks, including the entirety of the pandemic lockdowns. 

This week, our son was up sick all night into Tuesday. Due to some very specific work responsibilities this week, I wasn’t able to work from home or take sick days on Tuesday or Wednesday. So, my wife let her boss know she wouldn’t be able to be in as she had to care for our son and take him to the pediatrician, but she was hoping to be back in on Wednesday. The only response from her boss was an angry emoji, but he’s a trained chef, so “grumpy” is kinda just his default.  Just as an added detail to further demonstrate the absurdity of this, it wasn’t the 😡 I think you might be expecting. It was the little cartoon “Memoji” thing you can make on an iPhone. So it was an angry little bald cartoon face with Harry Potter glasses (John Lennon glasses, if you ask him, thank you very much). Not exactly threatening, and I honestly thought he was being a little lighthearted about it. She felt bad for not being there and adding to the workload of her coworkers, but we weren’t too concerned about fallout. 

After the pediatrician visit on Tuesday, our son received a prescription and my wife was informed by the doctor he would be required to stay home on Wednesday and Thursday, so she wouldn’t be able to come in on Wednesday either. She let her boss know that I was going to be sure to work at home on Thursday so she could go in. He sent another grumpy face, followed with a “we’re going to need to have a talk on Thursday about this.”  Well, shit. Nobody likes to get that. But even still, she’s been there a long time, works her ass off, and has a good relationship with the owners. It’ll suck to get chewed out, but oh well, I guess. 

Thursday morning my wife woke up to a text saying that she wouldn’t be needed that day, but to come in at 10am for a “quick conversation.”  What the fuck?  So then she spent the morning stressed out of her mind, wondering what on earth was going on.  She went in at 10 and was home before 10:30 in tears. I met her at the door and all she could say was , “Well, I guess I don’t work there anymore.”  This piece of shit spent about 10 minutes berating her in front of her coworkers. Telling her that he knows it was a frivolous call-off because “if it was such an emergency, why didn’t you take your kid to the emergency room” and even telling her that “it’s not my fault you chose to have kids.” 

Honestly, it feels surreal even writing this stuff. Who the fuck says things like that?  Anyways, I’m still furious about it.  And of course this is occurring while the railroad workers are getting screwed out of benefits that would protect them from shit like this, so it just drives home how many people have little to no protection as workers.  They just have to rely on the whims of whatever asshole has their livelihoods in their hands.  Work culture in the US is so fucked.

Edit: just fixing some typos. Wrote this on my phone and was clearly not very careful with my proofread.

Edit 2: I want to thank everyone offering support. I really appreciate it. I was kinda just shooting this into the void to get it off my chest and I’m grateful for all of the kind words and willingness to help. 

I am not opposed to naming the restaurant, but until I get the go-ahead from my wife, we’re prioritizing her mental health and privacy for the moment. If she decides to go more public, I’ll post info here in an update.",__The__Bedongler__,t2_fz8n2,0.98,2394,305
787,18ziov4,2024-01-05,WorkReform,"Salaried employee, but get none of the benefits of being salaried. Given offer to switch to hourly. Would you take it?","I got my first salaried position at this “small” business a little over a year ago. Before working here, I was an hourly employee in retail, and an hourly employee at a shop. It was simple - work ‘X’ hours, get paid ‘X per hour’

I assumed that this (exempt) salaried position would grant me more freedom; get the job done, leave early if it’s done. Stay late if it isn’t. No more clocking in and out - and the paycheck is always the same.

However, it turns out I have to work a minimum of 40 hours a week, still have to clock in and out, there’s no benefits, and there’s no possibility of overtime. I also can’t work 9 hours one day, and leave after 7 on another - despite it all still totaling 40 hours. It just feels like im working a salaried position with none of the benefits of being “salaried”.

Recently, I asked HR if I was allowed to leave early if I had more hours logged on previous days, as I had over 2 extra hours logged just from starting early/leaving late. It was escalated to management, and they offered to switch me to hourly. 

My 40 hour salary would be recalculated to a 35 hour rate, from the current $33/hour to $37.7/hour. The schedule (10-6) still remains the same, but i have a mandatory, unpaid lunch. But now I have the possibility of overtime (as long as it’s approved by the owner).

791,18ogw6z,2023-12-22,WorkReform,Coworker’s power went out and she decided to work from her car.,"Venting by also advice? I don’t know the legality of my employer doing things like mandating overtime without advanced notice, discouraging workers discussing pay and having an employee work in a uncomfortable environment for a day (in her car nearing summer - we live in the South).

My job sent out this employee of the month email in our newsletter praising an employee for working her car during a power outage. This is insane. I will never understand why my coworker’s give 110% to a job that abuses them.

For context, in January 2023, our department suspended our work duties in order for us to help other departments. They initially told us it would be for a few weeks. We are approaching January 2024 and have not gone back to our normal duties. They have made us train new advisors (we have a department for that), process applications (we have a department for that), assist with client appeals (you know what I’m going to say), among other things.

A few months ago, 10 minutes before getting ready to clock out on a Friday, they sent out an email stating that we had mandatory overtime for the evening. Advisors in other departments have been working mandatory overtime every month since 2019.

The woman in the EOM photo makes somewhere in the $40,000 range. You would think she’s making 6 figures with the effort she puts in. We do not get yearly bonuses either.

On the subject of pay, my department managers actively engage in discouraging employees exercising federally protected rights. Several coworkers and I have had several managers tell us not to tell our coworkers when we receive pay raises.

They also make employees of a certain level fill out production logs so they can calculate your productivity percentage. Had computer issues for 4 minutes? Put it on the log. Spent 10 minutes helping someone? Needs to go on the log. 

It’s frustrating seeing how my coworkers allow themselves to be taken advantage. Another one of my coworkers said during a meeting, “I don’t ask why I HAVE to do this. I wake up and say ‘I GET to do this.’” I cannot make this up. She makes about the same as the other woman. Mind you she’s someone who was facing eviction a few years ago because she couldn’t pay her bills.

I feel like my coworkers lack self-respect. I despise the people in this department and I’m counting down the days until I can leave.

And I snapped.

The tiers too are a good way to ensure that all teachers make a livable wage across the state.

He also mentioned the hiring manager wanted: ""Someone with OCD like I have that wants everything right."" That screams micro-manager to me. No thanks.  
The ""upwards of 6 figures"", and then coming back with a range ""over"" six figures is what makes me think he was wanting to low-ball me. I assume some recruiters get bonuses if they are able to get an employee to take for the job for less.

799,sov4u2,2022-02-10,WorkReform,Jobs need to respect bereavement more.,"While at my last job, my grandpa died. I was really close to him so it hit pretty hard. We knew he was dying so I was able to fly to him and say goodbye. 

My boss originally was very sympathetic, and told me to “take all the time I needed and don’t worry about when I’m coming back”. So that’s what I did (btw this was an hourly job, I was not getting paid for the time I took off, and I wasn’t screwing anyone over by not being there for a while as they were well staffed). 

I flew across the country and then took care of him with my family as he died. Then once he passed we had to fly to another state for the funeral so he could be buried with my grandma. This all took about 1 and 1/2 weeks, and when I finally got back home, I wanted to take another day off to finally just grieve and rest from traveling. 

I hadn’t heard a single thing from my boss this whole time. I figured everything was cool because she told me to literally not worry about coming back. And then my coworker texts me out of the blue saying, “boss is really pissed that you haven’t been back to work yet and is wondering where you are”. 

So, not only did my boss not communicate with me at all over the phone, text or email (which she had all of), but then she talked about the situation to another coworker of mine instead of just reaching out to me directly. I felt so disrespected, she had directly told me taking the time off was ok then complained about me behind my back. 

I immediately started looking for new jobs. Found one in a few weeks and quit that place without a two weeks notice. Their communication has always sucked but this was the final straw for me.

Are employers really that pressed for control over their employees that they can’t understand how death affects people? Even when I wasn’t essential I was pressure to come back to work, for apparently no reason. 

I wish there was some better policies in place for bereavement. I know this story doesn’t even come close to what some people have had to deal with. My grandpa was old, we knew it was coming and I had time to say goodbye.

807,ss8eos,2022-02-14,WorkReform,"Random thought: What if executive salary was capped at a multiplier lowest salary, and executives' bonuses were calculated based on employee, customer and contractor retention and satisfaction?","Edit: multiplier ***of*** lowest salary, titles can't be edited.

So executives could still make potentially very high pay beyond the caps, but only by demonstrating that the company under their leadership is measurably leading to happy employees.

I included contractors there because so many companies like Google and Microsoft habitually hire contractors full time that are affected by company policies but not actually ""employees"".  ""Satisfaction"" could be measured by random surveys run by an outside company, and employee retention is straightforward and almost impossible to fake.

Hell, how many companies actually collect year over year employee retention statistics and present them to the board, and publish them?  All of them should.

I have no idea how to make this happen- it's not really the kind of idea that could be legislated, but it is the kind of thing shareholders could demand & that would potentially be a long term net benefit for a board of directors to approve / shareholders to demand.

Actually now that I think about it, publishing employee retention statistics is something that could be mandated and probably should.  The SEC could probably make a rule for any publicly traded companies.

Edit:  To highlight since many people are overlooking it, the key part of the plan is  that executive bonuses above the cap are tied to employee retention.  Yes, I know this can't be legislated.  But company boards can implement it, shareholders and investors can demand it, and it benefits them (long term) to do so",JustSomeBadAdvice,t2_602o7,0.97,853,119
808,sxqf0j,2022-02-21,WorkReform,"""Raising salaries will result in small businesses being priced out"" - how do you counter this argument?","A common argument I hear when discussing work-reform stuff is that raising the minimum/livable wage is all nice and well, but it will price out small businesses. 

It's good to talk about Starbucks raising its wages and how it can afford to do that and not hike prices (reduce profits & CEO salary), but it's a whole different ballgame for small businesses where the owner might be making the same or not much more than the employees themselves after a salary raise, notwithstanding the fact that many small businesses are already on the brink of bankruptcy with very small profit margins.

The argument is that it's much easier for the big companies to raise salaries than for the small ones. Therefore, if this happens, big companies will be much more attractive to employees and small businesses will disappear.

On the face of it, this sounds to me like a valid argument. What is the answer to it?",DonDino1,t2_1akeaca6,0.97,1292,693
809,1agw26k,2024-02-02,WorkReform,Salary negotiation at Nonprofit,"Hello everyone, apologies if this will be a long post, but I would like some advice on whether I can leverage a second interview to receive a higher salary at the nonprofit (Company A) I work at currently. To start I live and work in the Bay Area in California. I currently make $26 an hour and I applied for a management position at Company A, managing a contract I am very familiar with. I know Company A budgeted $81k for this role, but I was offered $65k because I lack management experience although I have the rest of the skills and capacities that the job requires. I negotiated and was able to get a starting bonus of $2,500 but still feel disappointed since I am very familiar with the contracts, reporting, people we will be working with, and literally everything else but I’ve only ever been a manager once for a few months. 

Anyway here is my dilemma. I received a call back from another nonprofit (Company B) for a similar role. They invited me to do an in-person panel interview, this would be my second interview with them. The starting salary for Company B is $72k and the interview would take place the same week I should be starting my new position. 

So I ask, is there a way to leverage this possible job offer with my current company? The department I am transitioning into in company A has had a lot of recent turn around, so they are a bit desperate to get someone hired. Or would this be a long shot? 

I should also mention that I have not received a letter of hire yet or signed any contract with my current employer.

TLDR: I am transitioning to a new position in my current company but was offered $16,000 less than the budgeted amount for my position and I received a second interview at another nonprofit for a similar position and their base pay is $72,000. Can I use this interview to negotiate a hirer salary?",1sele1,t2_5ju44tjj,0.76,8,5

824,vau2et,2022-06-12,WorkReform,My work’s new attendance policy is needlessly punitive and is forcing employees to come in sick.,"My work just rolled out a harsh new attendance policy. You get three call-ins before you’re fired. They will not accept a doctor’s note unless you’re hospitalized (and in some cases, employees are saying that they’re getting written up for being hospitalized). Family emergencies do not count with very few exceptions. Flu, strep, colds are unacceptable reasons to call out.

My wife had surgery a few weeks ago and my manager said he would work with me. I come back to work and instead he wrote me up twice, putting me 2/3 of the way fired in a single week AFTER he told me he’d work with me. I went higher up but management told me the same thing- family emergencies do not count. 

They say if you’re sick you’re supposed to come in so that the manager can send you home. (In and of itself, insane). But in many cases employees are saying that they’re being forced to stay… or worse. My coworker came in sick and my manager sent her home. Then he wrote her up for being sent home. This is not an anomaly, this is an accepted reason to write someone up now. They have also written up people for being sent home on slow days.

The new system has it so you can “work off” your occurrences by coming in on your day off, or staying late. *Except* your manager is not required at all to remove your dings, they can make you jump through all of these hoops and still decide to not commend you at all.

I’m naming and shaming, folks. If you live in Texas, this is the new policy at HEB, and if you are immune-compromised or care for someone who is, your hard-working partners are 100% coming into work sick.

833,vk2n5w,2022-06-25,WorkReform,I feel like we need a womens union,"So, I am not really expecting this post to get any traction, but I am writing it anyway. It may be the wrong time to propose solutions when everyone is raging, but I cried already and I don’t know what else to do. Also, I don't typically post on reddit. I am more of a lurker. I hope this is an OK post for this sub. I feel like people here might appreciate the idea. If it's not though, I don't know, Delete it. This is mainly a vent post anyway and I'll be cross posting to my tumblr. 

You’ve heard of labor unions, consider a woman’s union. I think we need a women’s union for the following reasons:

1. For general strikes: everyone keeps saying “walk out!” and I wholeheartedly agree. But this is not always easy to do for people with no savings (so most Americans). I propose people pay into a union, then strikes can be organized by state, and money can be funneled from a national pool to the people in a given state who live there to cover living expenses should they face a job penalty for striking. This would make striking kind of slow, and it would require mass solidarity that to be honest I am unsure we have here in America. But I think it would be effective to massively cripple one state at a time. I would propose also starting in poorer states, because I like the idea of paying people to strike and perhaps helping out with poverty at the same time. 

2. For networking- say you DO get fired for striking, a well-connected union could help you get a new job and perhaps help with moving expenses. 

3. For policy advocacy: I am an advocate of reproductive freedom. Reproductive freedom includes the following: 

a. Abortion availability- because “abortion is healthcare” is not a fun slogan, it’s a fact. Not every pregnancy can be carried to term no matter how badly people may want that to happen. Abortion is a necessity and the only treatment option for fatal pregnancy complications. Additionally, it should still be available for when birth control fails.

b. Speaking of- birth control availability. Because abortions happen less when people can actually engage in family planning. Additionally hormone regulation is useful in managing many female specific health conditions. 

c. Comprehensive health and sex ed- health ed, because the number of women who have no idea how their own reproductive system works is actually quite high. The number of women who are shocked by what pregnancy does to their bodies is quite high. Family planning requires informed choices. Sex ed- obviously, everyone should know how babies are made and how to prevent that from happening or make that happen should they so choose.

d. Well-funded research into women’s health conditions- because women in medicine are treated like alternative men, and so our bodies and physiology are woefully under-researched. This needs to change. Additionally, conditions that affect the female body are largely under researched with a few exceptions. But for issues that affect mostly women, like migraines for instance, or female specific conditions like PCOS, for instance, if you look into them you will run into “the cause is unknown” far too frequently. 

e. Women centered healthcare- because too frequently, when a woman IS pregnant and at the doctors she is cast aside in favor of the baby. This is not ok. Women are not incubators we are people, and we need to be cared for as such while pregnant. It should be obvious here that revamping our healthcare system would also be part of this (like single payer, for instance)

f. National parental leave policy- It should be at MINIMUM 6 months. 

g. Free Daycare and Pre-K: studies show that access to these help the kid’s development immensely. Plus, every new mom I am aware of struggles way too much to afford daycare. Invariably, keeping your job is a challenge when you have nowhere to keep the child while you’re at work, and financial independence is important for women. Additionally, how do you save money for the things your kiddo needs when you spend all you income on daycare? You don't. 

h. Subsidized maternal necessities- like vitamins, formula, diapers, etc. These are expensive and draining for young families.

i. Flexible work schedules and arrangements- because a good way to minimize that pesky pay gap we keep hearing about it to make it so women have flexible hours in which to clock in and out of work. Additionally, flexible work arrangements are helpful. We already have work from home, we should keep that going for this reason. This type of policy is also useful for elder care. Both of these, elder and child care, typically fall on women, but it would benefit everyone to have them. I have personally experienced this, as a woman. I have utilized work from home to go help them, and I was able to do my job and be helpful to my family. 

A union would be helpful in vetting candidates who support these policies, and it could act as a voting group as well. I am tired of begging politicians for my rights. How about we make them come to us? 

Starting a family, and managing family planning, as well as remaining child free should not be a death sentence to anyone's health, happiness, careers, or life. We should create a society that is good for people, and a culture that supports people making the right choices for them. I am also no expert in organizing, so I have no idea how feasible any of this is. But I am solution oriented so this is what I got.",Electrical-Owl-8436,t2_p4rqnk9j,0.59,8,9

835,15bh43g,2023-07-28,WorkReform,I was fired from my job for leaving on time.," This is the most outrageous firing that I've had the pleasure to experience, unfortunately.

I work for one of the big pizza chains here in the US, and my store manager recently started to schedule me once a week to close. Now, there are tasks that need to be done in order for the store to be ready to open for the next day. MOST days we can not even start those tasks because we don't stop taking orders (this includes online orders, too!) until the very last minute of the store closing. So sometimes we can still be making and delivering orders up until not the last minute but hourspast it. In which you can get the gist that extends the time it takes to do said closing tasks. There also is some...no, alot of mismanagement that goes on during the day that also adds to the task time that the closing people have to do. Also, the shorthandedness forces people like me having to pick up more tasks or jobs in order to get orders made and ready. Like doing a ""front"" employee job while you're actually a ""back"" employee, get it?  And you can guess that extends our closing time and can add tasks on the closing employees. 

Like not washing the dishes throughout the day or not being able to do said dishes because some employees are doing the task of two employees. Which is part of the closing task, to wash all the dishes so the morning crew can get a quick start. But they pile up over the day. Adding more to the person who has to wash piled dishes for closing. 

Now I have stayed over before to get overtime, and even sometimes, when I wasn't even scheduled to close, I will stay in order to get overtime and help. Most times, if I'm closing, I will stay and finish all my closing tasks. Past scheduled the scheduled time for me to get off. But not the other night, I was not feeling to stay past my time in order to finish the task and wanting to leave at my schedule time. I told my store manager, who was working with us that night, that I was ready to go at my scheduled time. The time that he scheduled me. 

My store manager seemed a bit upset, but he still did the process of clocking me out. Yes, at this restaurant chain, you have to check with a manager, and they have to do a ""checkout process"" before you clock out. Now, I know what you're thinking "" Have they ever been a time that it was your time to leave, and the manager could not clock you out at your schedule time because they were too busy?"" And the answer to that question would, of course, be a yes. But back to the story, so that gave me the thought that he was okay for me to go ahead and clock out and leave at the time he scheduled me. Little did I know...

As I began to walk towards one of the front computers to clock myself out, my story manager mentioned that I should probably finish washing the dishes. I myself disagreed and told him, ""I will be leaving at the time he scheduled me,"" and that seemed to upset him very much. Upset him enough to threaten my job right there on the spot and claim that I will be ""abandoning"" work. I absolutely disagreed with that notion and mentioned to him "" that this was the time that you scheduled me and I will be leaving at that time you cannot be upset or threaten my job because I want to leave on time that, sounds something to illegal. You can not force me to be here on the clock.""

He said, ""All right."" And I replied,""All right, "" then proceeded to clock myself out and leave to go home.

Well, guess what? I found out the next day as I couldn't clock in... shameful. It's absolutely shameful! At first, I could not believe this, but then I remembered that this was not my first rodeo with labor here in America. Petty and pathetic were the next things that came through my mind as anger now seemed to replace those feelings of being worried about losing a job. Just pure shameful behavior! Who do people like my Store Manager think they are? Shameful, that's what.

Now, I have reported it to HR. Who we all know that's more like a shot in the dark, but I will give them their chance. This seems such like a clear and concise case, and I absolutely know my store manager is in the wrong! I gave them good work for a crap paying job...

 It is absolutely shameful to try to force someone to work and is absolutely shameful to fire someone for wanting to go home on time. Just plain pathetic shameful behavior, and now they're even more shorthanded now over such a mild disagreement.

Shameful.

Edit: grammer and I want to say thanks for all the replies to the post, even the replies that I don't agree with because it is healthy to have debate on subjects like this.

I would like to address those who disagree with my behavior or my choice to leave at my scheduled time. Y'all claim that I am entitled and that I deserve to be fired, but I believe those feelings are based on assumptions and fear. 

If the time on the schedule says the time that you're supposed to leave, there is no ambiguity in that matter. That is the whole point of a schedule to let you know when you're going to be there and when you are going to leave.  There's also nothing on most schedules that even list the tasks that you're supposed to accomplish within those hours, so the ambiguity in the task is already there. If my manager did not believe I could accomplish my closing task at that time, my schedule should have reflected that. 

I should not have to explain why i want to leave at my scheduled time or even be openly threatened with my job for wanting to do so. I don't owe them all my time just because they cut me a check.

Who is more liable for making sure those tasks are done?

Who is responsible for making the schedule in order to give us the time to accomplish said tasks?

Are  we truly workers if a job can fire you for leaving on time? 

Sounds like ""Slavery with extra steps"" to me.

But I can understand those who may think that I may be in the wrong, but I truly feel that your arguments come from a place of fear. It is a fear that we all have faced every day in today's world of labor. There should be no fear if you want to get off at the time you are scheduled, and there should be no fear to stand up for your right to do so without this type of retaliation. If my manager wanted to prove that I was not doing the work fast enough, all he had to do was schedule me with more time the next week for closing. If I could not accomplish that same task even with more time given, then yes, I would agree that I should have been fired.",Rebel_Havoc,t2_em4nb,0.93,526,156

This is my first salaried job at what is considered a “small”  to “medium” business. According to management and the handbook, I have to work 40 hours a week to earn my full compensation. There is no overtime pay, no benefits, or anything like that. BUT if I work under 40 hours a week, I am compensated on an hourly basis. Doesn’t that just make me an hourly employee with no possibility of overtime?

Here’s two examples; i had to work on a Saturday (usually off weekends), for 6 hours, and was granted 6 hours of “comp time” which i can use to leave early or arrive late - wouldn’t i just get either overtime pay OR an extra day’s pay if i was an hourly employee?  But, seeing as im salaried, shouldnt i be able to leave once the job is done, regardless of “comp time”? 

The next example is when i called out sick last week, losing an entire day of work - BUT because i automated certain aspects of my job, everything that needed to get done, still got done in my absence. I won’t be paid for that day, and will only be paid for the hours i was in office. Doesn’t that just make me an hourly employee? 

Im confused on how this whole thing works, and it feels like im being kept in a weird grey area of salaried and hourly…

844,u5cwxw,2022-04-17,WorkReform,Last week at my Job of 7 years,"I have spent 7 years at my current job. Six months ago my team lead left, he handled some significantly harder tasks with a lot more financial responsibility in his role. I took over his position, without a title change or more money. In the last six months, I found two major gaps in his process and saved the company approximately 500k in errors over those 6 months. I requested a pay raise of 10k a few months ago based on my increased hours, responsibility, and tangible evidence of my success. 

My boss responded with “he could only increase my pay that much if they created a new job title”. (This isn’t true the guy who left told me his pay when he quit and it was 4K over my requested pay.) I played along, he made me fill out job descriptions for my senior role and a standard position on the team. Then he submitted them to HR with paperwork for me to have the senior title. 

At my yearly review, he went on and on about new responsibilities he would expect from me with such a big pay jump. He didn’t acknowledge any of my success or effort for the pay, just that he wanted more. (We are already two people short of what we had a year ago) At the end of the review, he offered me a $9,300 raise. It felt like a gut punch no recognition for my work and didn’t even meet my requested pay. 

What he didn’t know, I had an offer on the table with a 15k raise, more vacation, and better benefits. The other job didn’t need me till May, so I had over three weeks till the start date. So, I signed the raise offer waited a week for it to process. Then turned in my 2 week notice. Now I’m getting the higher pay my last two checks/vacation time pay out. (Also, he hung up on me when I told him I was turning in my notice.)

847,y776s2,2022-10-18,WorkReform,My boss verbally abuses all of us (Massachusetts),"I previously worked in the medical field in administration and recently started a new job at a manufacturing company. The medical field was getting too stressful and I was losing a lot of time with my daughter. I started my new job at the beginning of September. I am head of general sales and I also take care of shipping and receiving. I knew nothing about the position I was hired for when I got here and I now am doing my position on my own with little to no training at all.

When I interviewed I should have taken him gossiping about the woman I was replacing as a red flag. He seemed nice enough and I have been in the administrative field forever. I am not incompetent. I am far from unteachable. I ask questions when I am unsure and make sure my work is correct before submitting anything.

Last week I was working on a project that has nothing to do with my position because my boss asked me to. My company puts on the towns Christmas parade every year. Mind you, whoever did the work last year was sloppy and unorganized so I had to fix a lot and have him check lists to make sure everything was correct. He couldn't be bothered with making sure it was right so I did my best and put in extra work just in case. 

I was screamed at and berated for doing extra work. I was gas lit and told he didn't tell me to do certain things that he absolutely told me to do. I let it slide the first time it happened. And the second. And the third, which is very unlike me. I should mention I am 5 months pregnant and super hormonal. I am not the type of person to cause conflict. I was abused in my relationship with my daughters father and do not take any type of abuse lightly. 

After the fourth incident I lost my shit. I told my boss if he kept up he would have a lawsuit on his hands. He has created a hostile and toxic work environment not only for me but for the other two women in the office I work with. He has tried to pit us against each other. He lied and told me they have an issue with my work which is untrue. The only person who has had any complaints is him. He tells me he wants something one way and then I do it that way and he screams at me and says he never told me to do it that way. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry for the novel. I don't know where to go to find help for this. We have no HR department and he has friends in high places.

I recently found out there were allegations against him by previous women who worked here years ago and nothing was ever done and they were fired. Mind you he has gone through 4 women in the last 4 months in my position. Claiming they are incompetent and weren't ""grasping training"". There is no training. At all. My first day my co worker showed me how to use the system once and I have figured it all out on my own since with little to no mistakes.... I feel like if I go to the labor board nothing will happen. I refuse to be screamed at, gas lit and put in constant stress any longer. If I lose my baby because of this it's not going to be pretty.

We are not unionized, and technically “students” as we are musicians in residence at a private university, but we are paid stipend salaries via W-2s as full time employees. But the fact that we are technically students gives me little hope that we have any protections against these new policies :( 

Our job is notorious for giving us extremely little/no time off, and the sparse time off we are actually granted is vetted by the administration, who arbitrarily decides if our requests are legitimate enough to be fulfilled; also, this time off must be earned with additional unpaid work. So, as a result, people have begun resorting to calling in sick when they desperately need time off. 

Unfortunately, the administration has caught on that a small minority is using this ‘loophole’ to avoid the risk of their leave requests being denied. As a result, admin has decided to crack down on EVERYBODY in the organization. 

The admin responds to this by saying that if we are sick, we must still show up to work in person so they can verify we are actually ill. If we are too sick to show up to work in person, they will COME TO OUR HOUSE to verify that we aren’t making it up. 

Doctor’s notes will no longer be accepted (as they claim these can be falsified). COVID tests must be taken in person in front of a boss to prove it’s real. 

Playing injuries from overuse are common at my work (tendinitis, carpal tunnel, nerve injuries etc), because the orchestra is basically operating as a skeleton crew—our schedule is incredibly rigorous and we have very few breaks at times. 

The administration abuses the fact that we are not unionized to not have an upper limit on how much we can rehearse; all of these things are regulated and capped in unionized orchestras. This has resulted in many/most of the aforementioned injuries. 

But, they will only give us relief from work if THEY decide we are indeed injured and not making it up (there is no qualified physical therapist or health worker on staff) 

Anyway, the idea of my boss showing up at my front door to force me to verify that I am actually sick/feverish/throwing up/etc. makes my skin crawl, and I didn’t know if I had any protections against something that invasive. It feels like a massive breach of privacy. 

I’m still so appalled that despite us mostly being extremely overqualified professionals in our late 20s and 30s, we can be so infantilized and put on such a short leash by the higher-ups. Our pay is already pretty much dirt. Working in the arts is already low-paying enough as it is, because most of us pursue this career due to our love and passion for our craft, not compensation. We have no orchestra committee anymore, and any any complaints we’ve tried to communicate in the past have been dismissed with things like “you’re lucky you get paid at all” 

Feeling pretty demoralized, so advice or insight would be appreciated. 
Sorry about the long post! 
Thanks for reading.

Edit: we are located in New York, and the administration is most likely going to email out these policy changes in writing very soon.

For those saying to just unionize—I wish it were that straightforward. The founder of the organization specifically created it as an educational program so it could sidestep unionization from the American Federation of Musicians. Students in a “graduate program” (though it is a complete farce) are much more easily taken advantage of than professionals, and that is their excuse for all of their exploitative practices. It also becomes tricky when you realize that a large portion of the musicians are international, and depend on their job as a means of work/student visa to stay in the US. I wouldn’t know where to start, or who to even contact. I’m not saying it’s impossible, just that it’s a complicated situation, and I really don’t know what protections we’d even have from termination if we tried to go down that road.",Sad_Musician24,t2_4cr9jahz,0.99,422,96

858,17jzyaz,2023-10-30,WorkReform,My monthly budget - It is impossible for the median American household income to afford the basics and I have proof,"I just got done doing my annual budget. I do it every year in October. This includes my wife and I.

TL:DR - My wife and I need to make a minimum of $43.27 an hour, which puts us in the Upper-Middle Class income quintile for the USA. That's not possible for the majority of American households because that's literally what ""income quintiles"" represent. 3/5 of Americans struggle to get by day to day because it costs too much. All these numbers are based on the fact that I have zero debt \[except my mortgage\] which makes my point even stronger - [Americans have debt](https://money.com/average-american-personal-debt-amount/).

Here is how the monthly expenses break down. First, house + utilities:

|Item|Cost|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Car Insurance (both|$140|For both of us|
|Mobile Phones|$168|For both of us|
|Lawn Care|$160|Monthly average, mowed once a week in ""season"". Includes treatment in the spring. If lawn is not kept, fines from the city starting at $200 a week.|
|Internet|$81||
|Electricity|$110|Average per month|
|Gas Utility|$75|Average per month|
|Water and Trash|$80|City combines them|
|House Payment + Maintenance|$2,200|$2,050 total mortgage + $150 in average maintenance (cleaning, repairs, etc.).|
|**Total per month**:|**$3,014**|**Dammit**|

&#x200B;

Now all the rest of the expenses:

|Item|Cost|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Parking|$58|Required. I work. I have decently cheap parking. I looked.|
|Spotify|$15|For both|
|Gym|$43||
|Car Maintenance|$70|Includes tires, oil, minor repairs, averaged over time. This is a solid number for car ownership.|
|Gasoline|$360|We both work and must drive to work. This is mostly me because I work all over, sometimes. Averaged per month.|
|Road Tolls|$65|Averaged. I travel sometimes for work.|
|Amazon Prime Membership|$10|Averaged per month.|
|Grocery|$1,000|Includes 2 adults and a baby (less than 2 years). This is a rounded up number but is solid. This includes eating out instead of just home. But we eat almost exclusively at home.|
|Clothing and shoes|$285|Averaged. Wear and tear from work. I have to replace my shoes an average of once every 6 months. This is mostly for wife and baby, though.|
|Books|$8.50|Average per month. I read a lot.|
|Babysitter|$820|3-5 days a week but includes all costs.|
|Medical, Dental, Vision, Life|$421|Includes an optional life insurance policy for my wife under my employer's plan (it costs less for more under my plan)|
|**Total per month:**|**$3,155.5**|Dammit|

So between my wife and I, we need to net take home **$6,169 per month.** That's *net*, not *gross*. Because this is stuff we have to directly pay to get by. We-30 have NO debts besides the house. I just paid off my student loans 2 weeks ago.

I used these calculators for hourly to salary and net income:

[https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/hourly-to-salary.php](https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/hourly-to-salary.php)

[https://www.forbes.com/advisor/taxes/paycheck-calculator/texas/](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/taxes/paycheck-calculator/texas/)

So what do my wife and I need, combined income, gross pay, to be able to afford the $6,169 a month, in the state of Texas (this is not where we live but I used Texas because I often have to work there and we may move to Texas)?

About $90,000 a year. That's **$43.27 an hour**. That's almost triple $15 an hour. $15 an hour will not cut it.

Do you see any debts in my budget (besides house)? Do you see anything lavish or outlandish besides clothing and shoes? We still have the babysitter left to calculate in this which I did not include. That's $720 a month because my wife works Saturday and Sunday so we really only need 3 days a week. That's a deal.

&#x200B;

Do you know what income quintile this monthly budget requires my wife and I to be in?

[https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/household-income-quintiles](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/household-income-quintiles)

Based on 2021's numbers (and we know it is much higher these days due to the absurd inflation), that puts our basic budget needs/income in the 4th income quintile. Upper-Middle class, right? Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose, though? Shouldn't this very tight budget put me in the lower-middle class since there's nothing really luxurious or lavish about it? I have no debts besides the house payment, right? So why is this budget in the Upper-Middle class income quintile?

Upper-Middle Class should mean I am living in a life of luxury but nothing crazy like super boats, super cars, mansions, etc. That's for the Upper Class. But I should be able to afford a nice car every other year, a very nice home, nice vacations once or twice a year. But Upper-Middle Class in America is now barely getting by with no debt.

I'm in the Midwest. I live in a 2000 square foot home. It is not super fancy. Yo, where are the luxuries I'm supposed to be experiencing now that I'm ""here"" in the Upper Middle Class?

&#x200B;

What are your budgets? Am I crazy? Are your budget items within the ballpark of mine? Do you spend as much money on food as we do?

The solution for all of this, of course, is to form unions, pass more employee protection laws, and ensure pay is keeping up with inflation. The US is not there, yet. We have more work to do. Imagine what it is going to be like in 10 years when the next generation enters the work force? Let's improve the system for them, even if we won't benefit much from it.

&#x200B;

Edit - Budget does not include savings or retirement investments. On purpose. Because you shouldn't have to be upper class to fucking retire. I didn't even need to go that far on the budget to prove how fucked up trying to live in the US is.

 figured out how to edit. Seriously, I did not know how to edit posts after the ""update."" You have to click ""view full comments"" to get the edit button back. Corrected the budget to include baby sitter and the non-car insurances. House payment includes an escrow for taxes and home owner's insurance (required while we have the home loan because it is FHA so I would have to refinance if I want to drop my home owner's insurance). So the midlines match the bottom line, now. Sorry, manually entering stuff from excel. **$6,169 is correct.**

Also, I didn't make this for advice on how to save money. I'm doing well. As another pointed out, this is not a budget subreddit. I made this post to draw attention to the fact that costs are stupid ridiculous and our wages are **not** keeping pace. Also, I wanted to read about your costs and budgets and to see how folks are getting along in this ridiculous cost of living. Additionally, many of you fine folks have offered excellent advice. We have to live with this economy until we can change it, right? Let's lift each other up.

In 3 instances, a man has made a move from being a data analyst to being a software developer. In those cases, their salary was adjusted to roughly the salary of a recent college grad with a computer science degree.

However, when my coworker who is a woman did the exact same lateral movement, her salary was not adjusted at all.

What can I do to help her get the compensation she deserves? She easily should be making like \~30k more. I was thinking about filing a complaint to HR or something, but thought I’d ask Reddit to see if there’s any better course of action.

&#x200B;

ETA: to do the lateral shift, they all had to go through the interview process of their new role, so it wasn't just a simple switch to another role.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: so it turns out I did not have complete information. Her salary is actually roughly where I would have expected it to be albeit slightly lower than I'd expect based on the value-add she provides from her work with her previous role, but definitely not the \~30k deficit I initially thought based on a prior conversation we had like a month ago. After speaking with her about it, I was able to get the straight facts.  


Thanks for all the advice. I'm still glad I asked because it prompted a good conversation between her and me about wages and compensation which I say I'm all for, but don't practice as much as I preach.   


Also, to the people asking why I'm involving myself with my peer's compensation or that she should handle it all on her own...what do you think r/workreform is about? The status quo is this ""rugged individualism"" that leaves workers in the dark about their wages and lets employers exploit them even further since workers are NOT encouraged to discuss wages.

865,18jolxa,2023-12-16,WorkReform,24/7 Motel Manager…. How much is a fair salary?,"Hello friends! 

I currently am managing a hotel where I am in charge of a 29 room motel here in Northern California. I am the only employee besides the housekeepers. 

To preface, I have over 10 years experience in the hospitality business. I am also trilingual in English, Spanish,Gujarati. I hold a finance degree as well from a California university.

I just started here October 1st this year and I am making $5000 a month pre tax. My duties are to take care of the day to day operations with the front desk and all of the customers that walk in through the door 24/7. I also am in charge of ordering supplies, doing payroll for the staff etc. 

I am always on site and I’ll have phone calls/check in at any possible time so I’m always on even if it disturbs my sleep.

The only perk I have is that I have a kitchen and bedroom attached to the front office so my living/utilities is covered.

I have nearly doubled the business revenue comparing Q4 of 2022 with Q4 of 2023. I have increased the ratings and reviews simultaneously as well since the previous management was dogshit.

 I have been absolutely murdering it, the housekeepers love me since I speak Spanish. The customers love me since I provide excellent service and I am extremely personable.

I have reduced costs as well by making changes to using different suppliers and changing out the old property management system to a newer/better/cheaper system.

I even will clean rooms up and resell them if a customer checks out early. I treat the place as if it was my own.

How do I propose a raise based on my experience and performance? What do you guys think is an appropriate salary?

The minimum wage here is $17.25 per hour.

If there are roughly 30 days to a month with 24 hours each day that equals 720 total hours a month.

$17.25x 720 = $12,420",Strain-Sharp,t2_abgmpphq,0.94,104,58

The company treated me like a cog in a machine instead of a human being. They made me cry regularly and made me question my worth. When I realized that wasn't okay, I decided to find a new job.

I got hired at a place super close to my house, doing what I specialized in in college. The pay and benefits are better, and the management seems amazing.

I don't start until next month, but I have enough money put away to take a much-needed vacation between jobs. Well, it won't be a vacation. I bought a house recently and have to spend this time getting everything squared away.

I've never felt so relieved and in control.

Fuck my old job. Fuck management. Fuck that capitalist nightmare. They only cared about profit. They didn't see any employee as human. 

Gotta name and shame the place, obviously. It's select medical. Not gonna list the office so I don't doxx myself, but I advise everyone to stay away from the company at any location.

867,18f1jih,2023-12-10,WorkReform,Is my job prejudice?,"Sorry for any misspelling or grammatical errors. I'm on my phone and it's 4:00 in the morning. 

 I currently reside in Hawaii with my significant other since the beginning of this year. I started looking for jobs as soon as we moved here but it hasn't gotten me far, even just getting an interview at least. I resorted to seeking help from a staffing agency and they were able to give me an assignment as an admin. with an insurance company. From the start I've noticed small red flags but nothing too drastic at the time. 
Some things I've noticed in the beginning was I was the only black female in our small team. Our team primarily consisted of only asian, pacific Islander or white. Of course same scenario with the higher-level management who were all either white or asian. But I didn't think really much of it at the time cause I really needed the job and plus, it was remote which really helped with not having to commute every single day. 

When I first started, there were some things that my team lead was doing that made the training process much more difficult then it had to be. I had a lot of issues with just getting the technical stuff working and it seemed like I had to figure it out on my own on how to do the basic stuff like being able to log-in. It was always something wrong every day for those first few weeks that I alone I had to figure out myself. Usually when you start a new job, everything should be ready or they would tell you what is needed on the first day of work. But here, it seemed like nothing was prepared. Of course I asked my team lead so many times about the issues that I was having but it seemed like she always brushed it off or told me to just contact Help desk. There were other times when I came to work she would ask me if I brought something such as my laptop, even though she never told me I needed to bring it. Then she would talk to me in a way like I should have known to bring what was needed even though she never said it in the first place. Plus, I was still new at the time so I wouldn't have known what was needed when I came to the office for training. 

Flash forward, I've now been working at this company for 8-9 months now and back in October my team lead told me that the company had a full time position open and that I should apply and send her my resume. So I was excited because I wouldn't have to be with a staffing agency anymore and would be able to work full time for a position that was remote! So I quickly applied and I sent her my resume and about a week later HR reaches out to me that I would be having an interview with my team lead and her manager in the coming days. I completed the interview and it seemed like it went really well. I was hoping that by the end of week they would give me the job since I'm currently working for them, I'm knowledgeable about everything I'm suppose to be doing and since I knew both of the leadership, they know my personality and how well I work with the rest of the team, I thought they would give the job to me. I assumed it was an internal hiring so I thought the process would be fast and I would hear back from someone. 

2 weeks went by, then it was 4 and then a month went by I still didn't hear anything back. I reached out to my team lead to see where I was at in the process and she said the hiring manager was still viewing application's which I thought was weird but I didn't argue it. Then another week went by so I reach out to HR and she basically said the same thing but stated hopefully the hiring manager should be done viewing applicants by the end of the week. 

Another month went by and this past week I noticed my team lead added a new person in our team on our group chat and I saw in her bio she had the title of the exact job position I applied for. I went back on the company's website to see if the job post was still there because in Nov. I checked to see if it was and the company still had the job post up. Now, the job post is gone and that worried me because I'm assuming they gave the job position to this new person. I reached out to HR again and they stated that my application was still ""in review"" and that she would let me know if she hears anything back from the recruiter. However, I'm not sure if she said that to save face or what but I think it's weird that they can't tell me any other information besides vague answer's. I would at least like to know if I didn't get the job at least I know where I stand. My assignment is about to end this month so I notified my staffing agency to look out for other job opportunities. It's all really sad because I feel like I've been led on thinking that I might have a chance but then it was given to someone else out of nowhere? Also like to note the fact that the new person does look pacific Islander too. 

I don't want to assume the job is prejudice but I was never given any performance review or anything so I can't base it on skills for myself. I'm just not sure anymore. It really put me in a depressive state because it's extremely hard to find a job in Hawaii let alone a remote one too. Would love to hear any advice or opinion on what you guys may think because I'm out of ideas.",sjsjssudhdj,t2_ewm5i3up,0.61,7,8

869,15gori1,2023-08-03,WorkReform,Businesses are completely out of touch realistic job qualifications versus interview lengths.,"I went out of my rulebook and applied for a job that did not have a salary posted. I did this because it was a job within an industry that I really wanted to work. 

The job posting stated that it was a temporary position, but full time and there was no salary attached (I fit all the requirements).

A recruiter called me and told me that the job was only for 6 months, the salary was under 60k with no movement available. 

The recruiter continued on to say that I would be speaking with them first, then the manager of the facility, then the director of all the facilities, and if I passed through all those I would then take a test. 

At this point I honestly did not know what to say. The skill requirements first of all, were far below what I had. The education requirements, were far below what I had. For God's sakes I went to school for this, I have a degree, and an honors within this area, plus years of experience. 

Quite frankly, these employers can f*ck off with their tests. I took my tests in school, got a damn degree, won awards for my work! I am not taking your test for a 6month job at 55k. 

Lesson learned, only applying for jobs with salaries posted. Hell, I might just have to work for myself. If I am going to only make peanuts, it is going to be from my own peanut gallery.",SnooCauliflowers3709,t2_2oym46ml,0.98,208,18

871,spb6qo,2022-02-10,WorkReform,"Salary worker ""unpaid"" sick day","Several years ago I worked for a company that had a handbook policy that ANY employee that called in sick  no matter the reason the day before or after a holiday (excluding weekends) would have that sick day unpaid.

&#x200B;

My co-worker called in sick on Friday and Monday was a holiday, a few weeks later his check is short and he calls HR to find out why.  He accepted the situation and I overheard his part of the conversation.  A quick google later I told him that the conversation with me would have gone quite differently.

Fast forward a few months and I am sick near Thanksgiving in a similar situation.   I pre-emptily contact that same HR person and inform them that I am a Salary employee and my check will not be short paid.  She was beside herself that some peon in the company would talk to her like this in HER KINGDOM!!  She informed me that my check would be short paid and used the ""ITS IN THE HANDBOOK"" excuse.  I requested a meeting with her boss before the check is cut.  She refused.  I created an email to my boss, her boss, and her with a short and polite description of the problem, the call, and a link to the federal law stating Salary employees must be paid for the FULL WEEK for any week that they work any time during that week.

&#x200B;

5 minutes later my phone rings.  It is the owners wife  (Head of HR).  She states company policy.  I tell her company policy is against federal law.  I explain that Salary means I do not get overtime (putting in 50+ hour weeks) but she must pay me my salary no matter how much work I miss if any work is done in that calendar week.  She disagrees and states she is going to contact her lawyer (Owners Daddy is a lawyer).

&#x200B;

I got my full paycheck.  The handbook still has the illegal time off policy in it to this day.

My company's official stance is pretty standard, along the lines of ""The company feels salary negotiation benefits employees best when individuals can negotiate based on their individual merit, and not as a part of an organized negotiation."" 

To be clear I am a well paid salaried employee, I'm moderately happy with my compensation. But for the entirety of my career every salary ""negotiation"" at my company has been with my manager (or a hiring manager if I'm changing jobs internally), the manager then says ""HR comes up with the compensation number, but if you're unhappy with it *I can talk to them for you*"". I am personal friends with managers at my company, and I do know they're not lying about how the process works. But I think this is a huge farce, I realized today I have *never* had a direct conversation with a person with control over my pay. Even my direct HR manager says that a ""compensation team"" is responsible for my pay. 

In an irony to my company, this realization was the result of a recent transparency initiative in salary decisions, they shared the inputs to the salary equation which are time on job and cumulative performance score, and then there's a salary range for job type. I am very happy to learn about this, it's also disgusting to see them make it plainly clear that there's not *really* room for salary negotiation. It's a take it or leave it scenario.

Just some food for thought, I'd encourage every salaried employee -even if you're making $500k+ a year, to really think about how your salary is determined.",Sxs9399,t2_ofz3bbqv,0.97,143,16

880,166xo1v,2023-09-01,WorkReform,Job pressures me to move then laid me off,"Hi all,

I’ve never posted on Reddit before but I just need somewhere to vent and this seems like the best place for my situation.

I was hired in my current role as a research analyst for a Fortune 500 company half way through 2022. At the time I was hired, both of the hiring managers I spoke to emphasized that they didn’t want location to be a deciding factor if I took the role or not. For context, I was in North Carolina at the time and my team was largely based out of the DC area.

At a team meeting in early 2023, a representative from HR gave a presentation and during a Q and A section, said there was no intention to mandate anyone back into the office. Not even a month after this discussion, my managers began circulating to the team that they would like us to be in the office more for certain events. Eventually, this transformed into requesting the team be in office two days a week.

Don’t get me wrong, two days a week isn’t that bad, but at the time, I was still listed in our HR portal as a fully virtual employee. From some informal conversations with my manager, she made it clear that the company was eliminating fully remote positions and that I needed to make plans to move to the DC area.

When I was hired, I had a written agreement with our HR team that there would be salary adjustment for making the move to the DC area. After I finalized my lease, I reached out to my manager and HR and provided my written evidence discussing the pay raise. The HR team took 3 months and repeated pressure to give a response. When they diid answer, they told me they did not accommodate off cycle salary increases and that MAYBE this could be reviewed during my next performance review (end of Q1 2024).

I had budgeted for my move to the DC area on my current salary and was looking forward to being in the area, so I didn’t push back on HR’s response. I enjoyed my role and my team so I didn’t want to burn bridges. For reference, my rent quadrupled and the cost of living is estimated to be 63% higher than where I lived in NC.

I moved into my DC apartment during the last week of July. Today, (the last day of august) my boss’s boss pulled me into a meeting with an HR rep and informed me that our team was being dissolved and that my position was eliminated. They told me they would look for another internal position for me, but I have no trust in this company anymore.

I now have 12 months left on lease and my company is only offering 5 weeks of severance. I don’t know why I wrote this, just looking for advice and needed to vent.

TL,DR: My company required me to move to the DC area and then laid me off not even a month after I got here.",Agile-Hour4715,t2_ihz5pvti,0.98,171,24
881,tb1vco,2022-03-10,WorkReform,My Job is Punishing Me for Losing my Apartment and Car,"Due to the fact I couldn't afford anything else on my shit wages, I was forced into a bad living situation that imploded on me 2 weeks ago, causing me to have to move in with my parents, who live 50 miles from my office.

Just to let you know, during the pandemic, we all worked from home, so it's definitely a job that can be performed remotely. Since then, however we have returned to the office for God knows what reason. Well, since I lost my transportation, I informed my boss I'll have to work from home for two weeks, until I can resolve it. He said okay.

All of a sudden, he gets into a frenzy over SLA breaches (after them making it harder over the past month to actually catch an SLA without spending 15+ minutes on it; forgot to mention we're also understaffed to the point where we have less than half the people we need).

Suddenly, he declares that starting next Monday, everyone will need to be in the office all days of the work week because of SLA breaches (we usually have Fridays and sometimes Mondays wfh), meaning my life has just become drive to work, work, drive home, go to bed plus $400+ a month for gas and wear and tear on the old car I bought. This infuriated me, as I explicitly discussed trying to work from home more with him since I live so far away now.

The cherry on top is that everyone of my coworkers is now blaming me for wfh being taken away, as my one friend there let me know this morning. Even though, my SLA breaches were no worse than anyone else's. So on Monday, I'm literally walking into a situation where I do nothing but Work, Drive, and Sleep AND everyone hates me. Not happening.

So, I've spent the work day on LinkedIn and Indeed applying to other jobs. Fuck this place. Might not even give them 2 weeks.

I got a promotion offer for another site and fled but I had 2 weeks left sadly at the site of discrimination. The female lvl6 and her boss randomly decided to strip me of my authority and duties of my level which again is against policy for multiple reasons so I once again reported them to the independent HR investigators. Only to be told later that because the lvl6 was a woman of power, she won't be fired or even talked to about her discrimination against me for being gay. I was told to deal with the homophobia because a woman of power was more important than my feelings which were borderline suicidal at the time because I lost my fiance and was now being openly attacked for being gay. I wasn't the only one either. I couldn't go to the media either because they would have fired me for NDA agreements all employees sign when they get hired which most don't know about.

I will see what I can do to email or upload this recording or audio(I have it on a flash drive on my laptop at home, & I also have Wondershare Filmora video editor, as well, coworkers or HR don't know about).

I feel girls are trying to target me, & it'll be girls trying to get up close to me, act like they think I'm supposed to be a sexual predator or something, maybe young girls wanting to bump/rub up on me, so they can lie & get a sexual harassment/groping case on me, i don't like any of those girls there, tbh, only 1 or 2 females in theew actually even catched my eye, & i even try not to get super close to them. I passed the same background check as everyone else in that building.

I stay at my station mostly, I'm always doing my work/trying to be productive, I don't talk to anyone in there much or bother lots of people. I fear I can be  victim of an assault in that building, someone breaks or take my phone so I can't call the police, or try to take my car keys. I still have that recording of guy communicating verbal threats at me, that's enough to warrant me having a fear of workplace violence, & not just company trying to label it as paranoid. 

They offered me VTO one night, & the scan didn't go through, I didn't see the lady's screen, she had her laptop facing away, & I wonder if she lied to me & didn't have VTO pulled up on the screen, so they could make it look like I just left on my own.

I also waa allowed to leave by a HR member who said she'd excuse my time, & that took out my UPT, as well. I'm now down to my last hour because of all of this, where I should be at 8-9 hours of UPT, still. I think I'm being targeted by HR & coworkers to be fired, & they're trying to cover it up/blacklist me. I asked one if I was suspected of stealing anything & they said no(I haven't stolen, I just want to ask them to see if they confront me on a lie).",Kitchen-Ad-4305,t2_2s99fwmi,0.21,0,32

I looked over and yes she was completely correct. There was a man sitting on a tote with his legs spread wide and his genitals fully exposed aimed in her direction. She immediately moved to the back of the line so she wouldn’t see his genitals and I went to find a manager to figure out the next course of action as I’ve obviously never had any situation like this ever occur. After an hour of waiting around the HR desk I was questioned about what happened and then they told me that they gave him a new pair of pants that wouldn’t expose his genitals so everything was okay. They did not ask the woman who initially brought it to my attention a single thing. They literally ignored her and asked what I thought. Basically I feel like a legitimate actual crime has been committed in front of my eyes and HR did nothing about it. This happened around 6 hours ago. Is there anything I should do? My manager immediately let me VTO but i seriously feel like this is a lot more serious than HR was acting.

This started when my doctor gave me a note for a chair at my station. I work in customer returns. And it took until I was carted off in an ambulance in the middle of my shift due to my leg giving out that Amazon decided they were going to give me my chair. A couple weeks ago, I was admitted into a psychiatric rehabilitation program that I’m supposed to go to three days a week and Amazon refuses to accept the paperwork.

905,16mettf,2023-09-19,AmazonFC,The weird promotion bias,"So, I've worked at an Amazon FC for nearly 2 years now and noticed a weird promotion bias.

People who have extensive experience in management and serious work ethics have an extremely difficult time getting promoted. A huge majority of them don't even get interviews. But literal teenagers straight out of high school with no work background get promoted ALL the time.

It's such a weird mentality because I always hear AMs and OMs talking about how strict and intent they all are on their promotional standards. They interview like they're about to promote the next CEO like a tier 3 is really that big of a role. But when the people who get promoted show up, it's almost like they didn't even care.

It sucks because as a tier 1, I have over 4 years of management experience, have a solid resume, and practiced 5 mock interviews. I got really good feedback and learned a lot. But when it came time for my actual interview, HR told me I was not suited to lead tier 1s and showed very little potential. Even the manager that interviewed me sent me strange contradictory feedback to what was actually said during the interview. And honestly, I feel like they made a lot of it up just to get me off the list. It literally sounded like they interviewed a completely different person with different star stories.

To top it all off, the person who got the role apparently had significantly less qualifications than I did. I didn't care at first but I had a pretty good reputation with coworkers all over the building. And they all say including managers, that it doesn't make sense why I wasn't picked. Then the guy that actually got the job ended up demoting because he couldn't deal with the responsibilities. The way I heard it, it sounded like they set this poor guy up to fail.

My experience is only one of many tier 1s who get glossed over for others. I've literally seen people who have been here longer than I have, who know EVERYTHING about the work and they're able to even run the show without any help. But again, their potential is just thrown away for what reason? This happens way too often to be only a few isolated events.

A part of me thinks they just want young spuratic faces to basically be cheerleaders. But the other half of me thinks it's like they don't want competition as silly as that sounds. But I really can't think of any other logical conclusions.

While i was at my packing station one of the pick training coaches decided to park himself right next to me and say some things that made me uncomfortable, he mentioned he knew i came into work a few minutes late some mornings, he knew about me moving from night shift and when i asked him how he knew these things he ignored me. He proceeded to tell me he has a girlfriend but he doesn’t mind cheating on her until they’re married. Then he asked me how many people i have had sex with since me and my childrens dad split up. After this we went on break and when i came back i asked the guy next to me if he thought the training coach was being a bit strange and he said yes he had noticed it.

After break he came back and stood directly behind me, i didn’t want to move or look in his direction because I felt that would make him start speaking to me again. I felt so uncomfortable and decided to tell the PG what happened so i was moved to another floor.

When i got to the new floor, the new PG, leadership and my manager all knew about what had happened and asked if i was ok and i said no. They didn’t question it further and put me at a station at which point i broke down crying, that’s when the manager decided he wanted to speak to me. I told him everything and he said i could deal with it formally and just have the guy spoken to about his behaviour.

When i went back to work a few days later i was told he had denied it all but they’ve made sure we would never be on the same floor. That same day he was on the same floor as me for almost 3 hours, he kept moving closer every time i moved away from him. So i went to HR, the girl at hr was kind and listened but then she passed me over to the head of hr and introduced her as ‘his old manager’. The head of hr responded to what he had said to me the way you would respond to your child making a silly mistake. They said they would move him but when i went back he was still there for another 2 hours. I went back to hr and said he was still there, and i was clearly upset but the head of hr was more concerned about whether i had spoke to anyone about what had happened because this would hurt the guy’s reputation.

If you hate amazon, try working for a small business with a micromanaging boomer mentality gen x asshole for a boss","TLDR: amazon may not pay as good as we want but considering zero experience is required it's not that bad. It's a pretty chill place for me especially compared to my previous job which laid less and was extremely toxic.


I know Amazon has been notorious for it's poor treatment of workers, ridiculously high expectations, safety concerns etc) but have been working there since February so ....idk if it's because I'm new and I haven't been in multiple departments...but I'm a picker. I'm an introvert. I used to believe I had to have a career and a job that requires college education to be successful due to that being drilled into my head that I HAD to go to college to be successful. I know a lot of you are at Amazon to get the college classes paid for but, I did it backwards. I was pretty much told by my mom that I had to go to college or I'd be kicked out my grandma (don't think my grandma would do that) when I said I wanted to get a job for awhile before college because I wasn't comfortable going when I had no clue what career I wanted.

 I went to art school, dropped out and then went to a community college medical assistant program and graduated with an Associate's degree in medical assistant. I went into it knowing the pay was medicore. I have a lot of interest in anatomy and physiology and health problems and I thought maybe that's something I could do good at. My main struggle was interacting with snd get up close and personal with patients. I did learn how to interact with people better and I did get multiple jobs ss a CMA, but....I just have a low stress tolerance and I'm lucky if I stay st a job for 1 year.

I eventually got married and ended up working amazon for itd awesome benefits. I wasn't sure I could handle the physical aspects of amazon which is why I took so long to apply. I got hired as a picker (seasonal but hoping to get a blue badge at some point). I love it there honestly.  I just left a job as a medical underwriter, and the job itself was easy as fuck, but my company was a small business with low pay ($16/hour), only 2 sick days per year and 5 vacation days for the first 5 years, and if you use you sick days your vacation gets taken away for each sick day you have. Not only that but he was pressing me to be social and get to know my coworkers despite then being all seemingly introverted themselves and 15-20 years older than me . I also had no insurance benefits (except for a $50 per paycheck stile g that we can use to buy our own), no job protection, no 401k, and since it's a small business with like less than 10 people they could literally get away with misogyny (boss once told me ""you know how women are, they love to gossip and talk shit about each other"".

 He also  had a rule that we need to arrive 5 minutes before our shift starts. And even if we less than 5 minutes early he would still call that late. My shift started at 8 and I would sometimes get there at 7:56 or 7:57....very rarely was later then 8 u less I got stuck by a train or something. And he would count that as being late. He said he wanted us there early so so we could literally be starting reading case on the computer at 8 (even though the office is tiny and there's really nothing else to do before I sound clock in. my desk was literally right there as you walk in the door.  

One of my biggest issues was that he blatantly gave his daughter special treatment (like getting extra vacation and the ability to leave an hour or 2 early almost every day. She was only working there less then a year longer than me and she got 2 full weeks vacation plus her own private office (which no other people got even though they've been there longer and have the same job title. 

I eventually confronted him about the nepotism because it's simply blatantly unfair to give your daughter extra vacations (even though she had plenty of sick days, about as much as me if not more ....but when I had a kidney stone requiring surgery and was out for a few days, he have me shit but used my 2 sick days and the other day was unpaid. It especially enraged me when he brought up my son's appendicitis when he complained about the days I missed (oh yeah he also included my 4 vacation days toward my total amount of absences) but....He just blatantly was like ""yeah I give her special treatment....too bad."" I'm not even exaggerating. I was so fucking over it. I quit the very next day. Then shortly after my 8 year old had appendicitis so I obviously I had to miss a day or 2 to be with him in the hospital. When I came back he said he would start taking away vacation days because if my 'excessive absences"" .... Like are really going to give me shit for having a kidney stond and my son being in the hospital needing emergency surgery?? What kind of ""good Christian"" does that? (he has conservative and Christian decor all over the office. Luckily I was able to take my 4 vacation days in July. Had I wanted to takBut anyways, later that year I had a surgery to remove my fallopian tube. Also griping about that. But by that. When I confronted him about the nepotism (I was already planning on quitting) 

 But the other thing that sucks about working for a small business with less then 10 people is he can get away with nepotism, misogyny, and discrimination of any kind because EEOC and anti discrimination laws don't apply to them. They basically don't need to do shit for their employees. Working for a small business you have no rights or protections (even the lame laws we actually do have in place that protect workers).

Not only that he was constantly contradicting himself. He had an employee manual but never followed it unless he felt like it. He would tell you one thing one day and then tell you the opposite later on. He would tell me how good I'm going kne day then when he was in a bad mood I'd be slow and not getting enough cases done (expect his spreadsheet showed that my case count was equal to or better than most of my coworkers. 

i've heard a lot of bad things about Amazon in the last so I was worried I would hate it and be worked to death. But since I'm a picker my job is mindless. I got an accommodation to use headphones which makes the time pass much faster. I just go in, grab a scanner,go to the little stand up area and then just go picking and mind my own business. Rarely need to talk to anyone ever unless I need to watch a safety  training video or something. Once in a while a pA or manager comes to you for something or an audit but I fucking love the job. 

 It's nice to be able to go the whole night without any human interaction. switching floors frequently is my biggest inconvenience. I used to be a shipt shopper and so it's basically just like that. It can be tiring and sometimes I wish I worke with more people but with my headphones I'm listening to.music, audiobooks or podcasts.

I feel a great sense if freedom and I know that can vary depending on what kind of management you have,.what facility you work at, what department you in, what shift you work etc. But for me I can just go in and work and make my rate and nobody gives a shit what I'm doing as long as I'm keeping up which I do mostly. Sometimes I get on a floor that is so quiet and hardly anyone else there which I love. I wish the pay was higher, but at least it's paying $1.50 more per hour and it's way more chill. No egotistical boss micromanaging me, I just go in listen to my headphones (accommodation) and just mind my own business and do my job. If I need to be absent I don't need to call or text anyone (,my last boss required us to calm so he could ask me 20 questions about what's wrong with me when I have endometriosis and really excruciating periods some months). I get upt and pto, great benefits, I have a 401k, I get more exercise (~25000 steps a shift). 

Amazon has also been great approving my accomodations and short medical leaves I've had to take a few days off twice.

So yeah. I know some of you have asshole managers and find the job souk sucking, but it's taken me 35 years to really I just don't want a career. I just want a job that I can tolerate that doesn't stress me out too much, that gives me flexibility with my schedule. I wish the pay was better (at least $20+ an hour would be nice) but sometimes I feel like if the job is lower paying but nearly stress free, it's worth it. And it's still more than the job I had before. It's more than I ever made as a certified medical assistant and a 2 year degree (my last job MA paid $15 an hour, the one before that paid like $13.50 in 2019). Seeing as how I need to work, I might as well work here.i just don't get why so many people hate it. Maybe my FC is just more chill. Our pick rate is usually 80 uph. Also maybe it's better on night shift.",ArtisticChipmunk9583,t2_7dcemf1j,0.76,192,237
914,12uawmt,2023-04-21,AmazonFC,Different perspectives? Amazon -> Air Force,"Hello all, I used to work at an Amazon fulfillment center about 3 years ago. I worked as an outbound packer, water spider, and problem solve for 6 months. It was my first job and it wasn’t too bad, I was getting paid $15.50, which is around 32k annually. Towards my last two months of this job, I noticed how mentally and physically tiring this job was getting as I would constantly push myself to be the best. I was able to quit that job and enlist in the Air Force to work in IT. For those of you that can do tedious, physically demanding, and mentally exhausting work, have you guys ever considered joining the Air Force? 

I’m no recruiter but it just seems like a no brainer to me, and I wonder what people think. The Air Force pays more and has the same benefits. I’m in my early 20s making around 60k gross (half of my salary is not taxed) with a chill job that cannot even compare to the warehouse. I relax most of the time in my chair and the work hours are shorter. Promotion actually happens and the pay boosts are huge in contrast to Amazon 🤷‍♂️. I’ve known people that have worked in Amazon for 3+ years and they are still stuck in the same pay range 😭. I strongly believe that if people can do Amazon, then joining the Air Force is a breeze. Amazon 100% 4x worse than whatever I got going on right now. 

The only reason why I mention Air Force and not any other branch is because I’m AF and we are known to be the most chill branch, got the most desk jobs, and has the highest quality of life. I may get downvoted for this post, and I don’t mean it for bragging but I wanted to share my experience with y’all, in what might be something that could potentially help. I’d like to think providing this different perspective could possibly get some people on the subreddit unstuck from the timeless hours of rigorous labor and shit PAs/leadership.

Disclaimer: The Air Force has a variety of jobs, leadership, and experience. Not all AFSCs (Air Force jobs) is going to be the same experience. 

TLDR: Air Force has better promotions, pay, pretty much the same benefits, wayyyy easier than warehouse work, so what is stopping you guys from looking into this?",stevan1229,t2_58ol0kf,0.84,16,46

I don't know how things are for you guys and your buildings but in this particular building there is a huge problem with discrimination and racial favoritism, but all of this discrimination is coming from the  South Asian culture. 

Cuz in our building 80%, it's probably closer to like 90 now of the building speaks Hindi or Tamil. And over the year and a half I've worked at Amazon of that 80%, maybe 10% of them are good workers, the rest of them have no common sense,they damn sure have no common courtesy, they do not respect the country or the citizens who live here. And they expect everything handed to them I've seen saw this one girl who was a white badge basically going up to her South Asian manager practically demanding that she get fast-tracked to being PA because she's here on a student visa. I've seen double standards first hand where I elevated a bit too close to someone and I was given a final warning for it. And then I would have accepted that but then I spend the next 3 weeks afterwards reporting workers of the South Asian background who broke the same rule but no punishment was laid on them.

And for the individuals who are not part of that culture who try to stand up against the discrimination they are instantly targeted marked out as racist and shortly after fired.

So I'm in the process of putting together a group lawsuit against this building and if there are any individuals who work at this Amazon who have seen the racial favoritism the discrimination the double standards from the majority culture please message me tell me what you've seen and I can add that in the lawsuit names will stay confidential but I need more people to stand up otherwise this will never change and these immigrants who come to our country will be able to treat people of their culture better than everyone else.

They claimed that his English was not enough to understand the basic safety as he ""failed"" their safety test. Their safety test - they spoke quickly but my boyfriend understood the safety stuff. He was able to verbalize it in his native language to me later.

The issue is this. His site supported Spanish speaking individuals. And one guy, who spoke French - the manager allowed to communicate through his translator thing. However, when he got to my boyfriend, he claimed that he did not have his language, but he saw the language and pointed it out to him. The manager insisted it wasn't there. 

How does Amazon, which has the job requirements to ""understand and speak English for safety"" hold Spanish people and that 1 French guy to one standard and my boyfriend, who is an Asian individual, to another standard? His English is actually not as bad and he was able to communicate most things in English and he mostly understands what they're saying.

Another annoying thing was that when he was at his pre-hire appointment, the HR people led him to believe that his English was good enough for the job, even going as far as saying that the job is easy and that other people with English skills far worse than him got in and were doing fine.

Anyway we have a discussion board in the front where jobs are assigned everyday that people write recommendations on, problems, and concerns.

959,18425rn,2023-11-26,AmazonFC,Your Job is Easy. You just want paid to do nothing.,"Every day it's nothing but Tier 1 associates complaining that they're slaves and dying and trying so hard to just survive the day working at Amazon because it's akin to a labor camp.

Spoiler alert, your job is to stand in one place and put dildos in a box, or to take dildos out of a box and put them into another box. Your job couldn't be any easier without completely replacing you with a robotic arm. 

You don't even have to know how to read. We give you a pretty picture of what you're holding, and then a light shines on the bin you put it in. If you're packing, your job consists of being a human tape roller, and somehow y'all still manage to fuck that up and your boxes break open on the conveyor. 

Managers don't get away easy here either. All y'all do is shove your actual managing tasks into your PAs and then do computer data entry. That's it. You don't have anything hard in your job. ""But I have to deal with the associates and keep them working!"" Grow a fucking spine and tell them how it is or they can walk.

There's only 4 positions that I respect at Amazon completely. RME (obviously biased) because we have to fix everything everyone else breaks, PAs because they're basically managers with less pay and more physical tasks, IT for the same reasons as RME, and SOME AFMs because you have to have 2 braincells to rub together to navigate a pod farm without becoming roadkill. 

I've watched T1 associates do some of the dumbest shit I've ever witnessed and I've only been here a year. Only yesterday I watched a picker RIP THE HDMI CABLE OUT OF THEIR SCREEN LIKE FUCKING DONKEY KONG because she, and I quote ""thought it was the power cord and wanted to plug in a fan"".

I've watched packers tape down boxes so badly that the tapeline wasn't even on the seam, just on one flap. 

I've watched AMs stare at jams at waist height while calling RME to clear it, WHILE HOMDING A JAMPOLE, because they didn't want to do it themselves.

If you're a Manager or a T1 and complain about your job being hard, you have soft hands and a weak spine.",NoMushroom8881,t2_avnpvoam,0.44,0,106

What I witnessed was she and some other girl and a guy were picking during same day and the person at the front missed a tiny box, so the other girl tried to hand her a box and she accidentally dropped it. It wasn’t heavily, it was a very small and light box. (Like very fucking light)

The mean girl got mad at her, mocked and and SHOVED HER because of it. I felt really bad because the individual who dropped the box is actually a very quiet girl who I’ve never heard speak until today. and all she said was “Oh, I’m sorry.” She seems shy. She probably just wanted to get her job done and go home.

She wrote an incident report and apparently according to the other RTS employees this is that mean girls final strike. Of course curiosity got the best of me and I wanted to know what the other strikes were and I’m so shocked she is still here.

She has harassed an ORANGE VEST so badly he had to switch to the Sort Shift to get away from her, she yelled at a guy cause he didn’t know English, she has tried to start a fight with these 2 deaf girls because they were “shit talking” her with sign language. (I would not blame the deaf girls if they did) 

She also tried to fight another employees HUSBAND! (He should have rocked her shit)

And she has like tried to fight multiple employees, literally has ripped off her fake nails to try to intimidate someone. 

These are just the stories I heard. I don’t work RTS so I’m not there everyday. I would not be surprised if there was more. 

I hope Amazon was serious about her being on her last strike and she gets fired for shoving the quiet girl cause I felt so bad for her.",QuietKaria,t2_8neo91ol,0.88,70,43

People I work around and chat with regularly, some of whom I KNOW wouldn't have an issue telling me I stink especially if I outright asked, say they don't notice a smell. I KNOW my wife would immediately tell me to get my ass in the shower when we got home if I got in the car stinking.

I know we are the least aware of our own smell. And if we smell ourselves, it's REALLY bad. And I know some people are more sensitive than others. But the fact apparently NO ONE else I talk to seems to notice it is just weird. It's been suggested that this might be done as a form of indirect harassment.

1003,ngghk9,2021-05-19,AmazonFC,Unvaccinated Among Us,"This sub is blasted with a such controversial topic apparently. Let’s confabulate about this. No one, I mean no one is forcing you to get a COVID vaccine (maybe your loved ones lol). I get that Amazon is making a way to “encourage” unvaccinated people to get a vaccine but **that is your choice.** If someone doesn’t want to get the vaccine right away, that’s their choice too. You can’t control or force them. 

So why not unvaccinated people go mask free? Because no one wants to put themselves at risk of getting the virus.  You are in a workplace with a lot of replaceable workers. We don’t know if individuals have or previously had COVID. Amazon sites still sending positive cases so they are working to get this situated. Most large companies like Amazon are doing the same way. It’s not a discrimination for asking for vaccination card in order to go mask free. In fact, you don’t even have to but you will have to wear a mask at this time. Besides, this pandemic is not over yet so why would Amazon chose to put risk first over safety? 

Fully vaccinated people even said they will continue wearing a face mask. No discrimination there but that defeats the definition of it. I heard some of you said that you can still get COVID even if you are vaccinated. I’m gonna go with two sides here. One, the vaccine was meant to build an immune defense against it. Two, no it is not a way to permanently block you from getting COVID but to prevent it in a safe and effective way. You may still get COVID but the risk is very low if you are fully vaccinated. It’s a mRNA that tells your body how to fight against it. There is not noticeable data trend to show that people getting COVID after vaccinated. If you are vaccinated and feeling sick, that is your body learning and fighting the virus. The vaccine is a way to lower your risk of getting coronavirus that’s all. Still mad about this standard foisted on all of us? Well buddy lucky for you, you have two options: Get a vaccine and go mask free or don’t get one but wear a mask. Plain and simple.

If you think you’re fine without mask or vaccine, then that’s your choice. You don’t care about the safety and well being of your family or your loved ones? Don’t get the vaccine, your choice. Want to go mask free at work through this pandemic? Get a vaccine or get a different job that doesn’t care about masks, your choice. Still unsure or don’t plan to get a vaccine, then don’t get it but you gotta have to wear a mask at Amazon, your choice.",SupSmasher,t2_8ajvmqbi,0.8,36,55

So, I'm on an HR given paid suspension, basically, but I have to still report each week for my scheduled shift because it's only for a week. I'm still scheduled for my next shift, I have to still report because A) I'm still scheduled, meaning if it's not coded by HR, it can take my UPT each day, which would put me under 0 anyway; B) HR is the ones essentially not letting me enter the building/badge access has been suspended, but they gave me my badge back each time I went there.

HR put me on paid suspension because I reported people trying to pick fights with me/workplace harassment(people trying to walk into/shoulder bump me, seem like people trying to get confrontational with me, sometimes girls be trying to get close to me, I don't like, I don't like none of those girls, like they want to bump into me with their hurts or something so they can try to use me to get a sexual harassment case).

I think they're discriminating against me & are seeking a way to terminate me, it's been several weeks. I'm still scheduled to go into my next shift, I'm going in so they either code it there on the spot or see if they're letting me return to work, but I don't understand it. They were supposed to reach out to me about a form to be filled out by a doctor to return to work, never have. Anybody know what that form is called, or if there's a way to access the form online or over phone?

It seems like they just don't want me in building while they're investigating something to fire me for.

Idk if it’s a new trend or just an anomaly. At the end of each shift, your manager has to clear time off task which shows the gap in between you scanning anything. If you have a gap, the first thing they’ll do is ask other managers have you seen this person. If not, they will pull your badge and see when you entered and left the building and if it doesn’t add up, then boom you’re fired. Also, if you start getting put into roles where you directly affect the entire building, it’s not because you’re the best lol, it’s because now I can track you without having to babysit you. I know exactly what time you leave because it affects other roles immediately and the flow of the building changes… and for everyone that puts in time off when you know you’ve been TOT after a manager speaks to you, you’re playing a risky game. I’m so sick of babysitting people, I just tell the managers not to talk to suspected time thiefs until after pay day, that way you cant retroactively put in time. I know it’s an asshole move but you’re really killing metrics when you steal time and I’m tired of babysitting adults lol.

1024,15pnxef,2023-08-13,AmazonFC,They updated my accommodation for no reason and give me final warning within a month!!! Pls help.,"Sorry for long post.

I have been working with Amazon for almost 3 years. Last July I transferred to AR pick. A month in to the picking position I know I can’t meet the standard because my long term physical ability challenges, so I applied for  accommodation. I successfully got my accommodation around September last year. The accommodation state permanently “pick at your own rate”. I am doing ok, try my best to get 300UPH. Fast forward to this June. My accommodation manager contact me to update my accommodation.

In my new accommodation restrictions include: bend/kneel/twist 2-4 hours at a time and UP TO 6 HOURS A DAY. Squat & climbing step stool 1-2 hours at a time and UP TO 4 HOURS A DAY. 5 min break every 2 hours.

Today I got my final written warning for my productivities. I told my manager about my accommodation, but he said “pick at my own speed” is never an accommodation so I am getting a final written warning.

First problem I can only do most of the tasks UP TO 4 hours a day, but they keep me in a role that need to do all those movements for 10 hours a day. They are refusing to transfer me to another department. I am not trying to discriminate, but I know there a lot of employees with accommodation in pack, why don’t they transfer me there? How people with accommodation get in pack?

Second my accommodation manager gave me five minutes breaks for every two hours. I ask my PA if I can sign out because it will affect my rate. PA told me everyone takes 5 min washroom break, it is normal and everyone do that. Is that means my accommodations manager give me a restriction that everyone can do, so why call it accommodate when everyone can take 5 min break?

I don’t want to lost this job, it’s hard for me to find a new job because of my ability challenge. With the accommodation I still try my best everyday. I think this is unacceptable to give my a new accommodation not allowing me to transfer and give me a final written warning just in 3 weeks.

Edit: I ask 3 different PA, they all said I shouldn’t get warnings when I am in accommodation.

1037,r5rggq,2021-11-30,AmazonFC,should i report my PA?,"one of my my PAs is very disgustingly showing favoritism to two females in my department. This is a READ so get ready.

my boyfriend and i work in the same department and we are very hard workers. we always get our work done with minimal talking to each other unless there is actually zero work to be done. Every PA, with the exception of the one i am considering reporting, always asks us to do that need to be done quickly together because they know how fast we get things done.

There are two girls that all the other PAs dislike because they stand around and talk the whole sort doing basically nothing while everyone else is working their asses off. The PA in question acts like he is in love with them. He follows them everywhere, talks to them for hours, and lets them do nothing. These two girls do not like me or my boyfriend for some reason i don't understand because i have had maybe 2 conversations with them. They told our PA that we talk too much and dont get anything done which is far from the truth, so he separated us by forcing my boyfriend to go to a different department.

I could care less if me and my boyfriend are in the same area. We live together and do everything together so that's not an issue to me. My issue is that he is playing favorites to those other girls every other PA cannot stand because he obviously likes them and finds them attractive. It's disgusting the way he treats me when i do nothing but break my back at work just because his two girlfriends told him to.

I talked to an OM about it and im waiting for him to get back to me  but I am considering calling ethics and reporting him to HR.

He also stares/leers everywhere i go, i'm assuming to make sure i am working, which makes me very uncomfortable and as per amazons policy is a form of harassment.

HERES THE SITUATION
I am a disabled vet and struggle with PTSD so just keep this in mind
Yesterday I was doing my job as a water spider, figuring out boxes and I had finally gotten them all put up and ready to go when another water spider came up to me to ask me about the army and my work ethic. I talk to him for 20 to 30 seconds and no more. Then we continue working when all of the sudden an hour into the shift our operations manager who is African American brought and picked out 3 white guys which all happen to be water spiders, the one I spoke to me, and another guy. 

He begins with I can’t get the other guy but you all are the main ones. He begins sternly and loudly, I guess to let others see and hear what’s going on and the whole warehouse hears him yelling this. Granted this is the first time he has ever had any problem with us.He says  look I don’t understand why the hell you GUYS THINK ITS OK TO STAND AROUND AND TALK WHILE IM OVER THERE BUSTING MY FUCKING ASS. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS,GET IT THE TOGETHER, STOP FUCKING STANDING ARROUND LOLIGAGGING AND HELP OUT. (He said he was doing the line and helping it go down but that’s what the taper is supposed to do not the water spider) Granted we had did our role and no blue lights were on. HE THEN SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUCK I SEE IS A BUNCH ON PEOPLE WHO DONT GIVE A FUCK. I MEAN WHAT THE FUCK MAN
IM OVER THERE BUSTING MY FUCKING ASS AND WATCHING YOU GUYS JUST STAND ARROUND AND DO NOTHING IF YOU DIDNT WANT TO BE HERE THEN JUST FUCKING CLOCK OUT AND GO HOME.

End of speech

No one said anything back and me feeling disrespected, belittled, and just overall under appreciated I told my PA that I’m not going to put up with being treated like a soldier in the army. 
If he thinks that’s how he wants to treat us then we’ll just clock out because I have mental health issues and I don’t feel safe in the environment I am in. Then a trainer said “oh, he’s just having a bad day” to which I replied idc that’s not my problem, you don’t treat your hardest workers like robots and left. He was so loud my ears were ringing and it made me want to blow the fuck up and yell back but I’m a changed person so I didn’t. I try to be nice, I got laid off at another job or else I wouldn’t have gone to Amazon. I am going to go to HR AGAIN TOMORROW BECAUSE that is workplace harassment and if they don’t fire him I will take legal action. I have a picture of the policy here.

I just need to know what can I do and how should I handle this because I want to take legal action if I can for discrimination, workplace harassment,and violations against the ADAA(Americans with disabilities act)

i just had a couple of questions for you all. i'm working a seasonal job now that's ending, and i'm thinking of applying at the amazon fufillment center by my house, but i'm a bit nervous. i figured i would ask a few questions on here before applying.

1.) on a scale from 1-10, how hard is it? is it super strenuous work?

2.) i have sciatica issues in my lower back, and i was wondering if i could get an accommodation for that, before starting? i can't lift anything heavy, or do too much bending because it triggers the pain, so that's one thing i'm super nervous about.

3.) i've heard stories about the bathroom breaks there, and the TOT, and i was wondering what if i have my period lol??? will they really time me to go use the bathroom, and change?

4.) on the topic of breaks: i know that breaks are short, and the warehouse is huge. will i have time to go and heat up/eat my food, or is it better to just not even attempt to eat? lmao

5.) what safety shoes do you guys suggest since apparently the zappos ones suck?

6.) i am planning to apply for the april 30th date, but i have a week-long trip, in may, that's been planned for a year now. do you think i can let them know about that trip before starting? i don't want to use any pto or anything for it.

7.) are we allowed to keep the clear bags they give us with our belongings, and our phones at our station?

8.) can we wear our apple watches?

so sorry this was so long! i just really want to know all of the details before actually applying!

1064,m78kh4,2021-03-17,AmazonFC,Harassed by Learning Ambassador,"Harassed by a Learning Ambassador.

Hi all, first off if I’ve made any sort of mistakes within this post, I apologize as I’m new to reddit. However, thank you so much for viewing and reading my post. Any replies are appreciated. So, here’s the rundown. Started working at a Amazon DS. Been there for about a week and a half now. The good, been extremely respectful towards everyone, never denying any task I’m given, and always working as hard as I can, everything has been great so far. Learning how to manage myself and the tasks I’m given efficiency, and see myself getting better by the day. I always receive compliments from managers, my supervisor and even shift assistants. Not to brag, but I notice myself working a LOT faster than my current coworkers. Especially during unloading, inducting and stowing. Now, for the bad. Since my very first day there, when I was learning and trying to teach myself to properly stow correctly with no training other than the super long Amazon video lol, I noticed no matter what I did, or how fast I worked, or even to how quickly I learned (which I got the hang of it pretty fast tbh) there was this man always just staring at me at the end of the isle I had been stowing in. He just stands and watches, and it’s not friendly. You can see his face is angry under his mask. Does nothing but looks at me, then when I look over at the oversize rack pretending I have a package to put there, he looks away fast so I don’t see him watching me and walks away quickly. but that’s the thing ...he’s not walking away. He’s just pacing to the 2 other isles over then right back to my isle to watch me work again. I know I may sound like I’m overreacting, and that’s why I didn’t let it bother me at first. It was the few days AFTER that experience that have been like hell. So since that happened, no matter what I do, where I go, or HOW BUSY I can be. This dude just stands there and stares at me with his hands behind his back. It makes me so uncomfortable to work to be honest. At first I thought “hey maybe my supervisor assigned him to keep an eye on me and see how I work”. But I now know that’s not the case. This man over my first week has followed me with every single thing I do in that warehouse. I thought to myself “wow his position must be a high priority since he doesn’t do any other job but stand and look at me”, I’ve never seen him Unload, induct, pick & stage, or any physical activities in the warehouse. I noticed his vest is labeled “Learning Ambassador”, he’s a pretty old (Indian/Bengali)? guy. Maybe in his late 40s, early 50s. So, here’s the main reason for my post. Today during pick & stage, we started and was 8-10 minutes into our routes. I noticed once again every isle that I go to, every bag I select, he’s just watching me. Even when I went to stage my first route he kept a little distance but just stood there looking at me. After that I went to start a fresh route, so I get my cart and unfortunately had to walk past him yet AGAIN. But this time I noticed he had a laptop in his hand. So I go to my isle, lock my cart wheels, clear my cart from the way, making sure I’m following the correct procedures as taught, loading from right to left and following all the safety measures, OBVIOUSLY with him watching me the entire time. I start loading my cart. I finish my bags and move to my oversize packages. He then calls me over and asks for my username on my badge. I give it to him and be very polite. He then goes “only 2 carts, why didn’t you do more?” I didn’t argue with him I just said sorry and stayed quiet. Even though it was very difficult to considering , EVERY other associate was still on their FIRST route while I was DONE with my second. I was the FIRST cart staged. After I apologized he then just looked at me, shook his head and went back to staring at me again. I am a 20 Year old Male Btw. Indian mixed, Im really liking this job and I really don’t want anything to jeopardize my employment, especially considering I’ve done nothing wrong. I worked my best so far. Oh man I don’t even know what to do. Can he get me fired or write me up? I have a few questions and any help is appreciated. 

So my questions to everyone are...

1. What ability does a Learning Ambassador have towards associates? Can he write me up just because it seems like he doesn’t like me and has a problem with me for some reason? I don’t want to even think about losing my job over me doing literally nothing wrong. Just because someone didn’t want me there and they had the power to get rid of me and they abused it.

2. What could he have wrote on that computer towards me when he asked for my username? 

3. How should I carry this on? My parents & wife were telling me I should talk to my supervisor about it (really nice guy) and tell him I feel uncomfortable. But I don’t want to escalate anything and put myself in a worse position than I already am in. What do you suggest I do?

I've been fired 6 times from Amazon. One of the MANY other things In life that I couldn't get right, and at my lowest and darkest time and feeling like I'd never be able to be, do, or have ANYTHING, For some reason these mfs hired me again. Idk why they did that, but I'm eternally grateful and I've never been so serious about my work ethic ever In my life, until now. Any other job In my city would've blackballed me from the company after being fired 6 times. Most jobs we're I'm from don't even give second chances. 

I'm getting my first car this week, Benefits are kicking In, and I can finally start keeping track of my health for the first time In years, and they're helping me with school. I refuse to disrespect what I do because what I'm doing saved me. I will keep doing It until I simply can't anymore.

 Yeah we stand In the same spot all day, yeah some of the red stripes are jackals, yeah HR can be useless at times, yeah some of the people are toxic and make you feel like your In highschool again, but you know what? I wouldn't trade It for ANY other job In my town.  


Idk, I guess I'm finally starting to realize that I ***WANT*** something In life. Amazon giving me a 7th chance helped me realize just that. Can't take having a good job for granted, people. I know Amazon have It's shittiness but so does every other profession. You gotta ask yourself, What type of shit am I willing to deal with?

I'm curious as to what the dress code does/does not allow at your FC. Particularly, if you are or identify as a woman.

For instance; my FC (located in northern VA) recently updated the dress code to include the following information located on the accompanying image.

I won't include my thoughts (just yet) on the above addendum, but I would love to know yours.

Also, bonus points if you could please include your position/job title as well as the FC you work at or at least what region of the US you are in. Thank you!

On January 3, 2023, JFK8 employee Richard Thomas filed a one trillion-dollar lawsuit against on-line retailer Amazon.com, Inc. and President & CEO Andrew R. Jassy.

The lawsuit arises out of Thomas facing several years of discrimination at Amazon’s JFK8 facility in Staten Island, New York. The lawsuit was filed in the New York State Supreme Court in the County of Kings (index# 500757/2023).   

The complaint alleges that Amazon failed to pay the plaintiff certain wages since 2020, which was the start of the plaintiff’s employment. The plaintiff also alleges that he faced several years of racism and other forms of discrimination as a warehouse associate inside of the JFK8 Staten Island facility.",bellevuealert,t2_q4wctvgq,0.21,0,6

So I see the look on her face and I’m like uh oh. So her being a water spider she’s got to dip in pulling pallets and train at the same time.

1120,ylppjp,2022-11-04,genderqueer,The 9th annual Freedressing Awareness Day is coming up in exactly one month. So I compiled a handy FAQ to explain why genderqueer and gender nonconforming folks need a day of visibility.,"# Freedressing Awareness Day takes place on December 3!

It doesn't seem possible that Freedressing Awareness Day is almost here -- a day to promote freedom of gender expression, but even more specifically to raise much needed awareness about the struggles of genderqueer and gender nonconforming people. I started the day back in 2013 in response to the death of Frank Wolf, a popular femboy cosplayer on YouTube who was bullied for being effeminate.

**Are there any efforts to raise awareness for gender nonconforming people?**

Unfortunately, few LGBTQ organizations specifically advocate for gender nonconforming people, particularly boys and men. There are, of course, numerous awareness campaigns  devoted to lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, transgender, nonbinary, and intersex people as well as for girls and women.

It Gets Better Project is one of the rare exceptions. It was founded in 2010 by Dan Savage after learning about the suicide of a feminine boy who had been teased and taunted in school. To this day, it remains the only major LGBTQ organization that still actively campaigns for gender nonconforming youth, while others have shifted focus primarily to trans and nonbinary youth.

**Why should we celebrate freedom of gender expression?**

Simple: Pride isn't only about gender identity or sexual orientation. For decades trans activists fought for freedom of gender expression, with a particular emphasis on gender nonconformity. In fact ""transgender"" was originally an umbrella for anyone whose gender identity OR gender expression didn't align with their sex assigned at birth. This entire notion that gender nonconforming people, regardless of their sexuality, can't have pride contravenes decades of historic precedent.

For example, take this 1996 interview with Leslie Feinberg, who's widely regarded as the principal architect of the modern transgender rights movement:

[https://i.imgur.com/JCgchK7.png](https://i.imgur.com/JCgchK7.png)

Therefore, whenever people try to argue that pride isn't about defying gender stereotypes, they are promoting a deeply homophobic historical revisionist ideal of queerness -- the aim of which was to completely strip ""gender rights"" from gay rights.

**Isn't freedom of gender expression only for queer people?**

Anyone can participate in Freedressing Awareness Day, including feminine boys and androgynous people. The very idea that gender nonconformity has nothing to do with being queer has its origins in anti-gay propaganda. 

For decades gay men were persecuted for expressing effeminate behaviors and mannerisms. So as part of an effort to distance being ""gay"" with stereotypes of femininity and thereby assimilate into mainstream society, large numbers of gay men began promoting an anti-feminine image of male homosexuality.

[https://i.imgur.com/wVlUQAI.png](https://i.imgur.com/wVlUQAI.png)

By the early 1990s, queer activists sought to counter the growing spate of femmephobia in the gay rights movement by creating a broadly inclusive umbrella for all ""gender outlaws"", including transsexuals, femme gay men, butch lesbians, drag queens, and yes straight crossdressers, etc. under the rubric of ""transgender"".

Even as far back the 1970s trans activists recognized that transgender and gender nonconforming people (known as transsexuals and transvestites at the time) should be united along the same front for ""trans liberation"" since they face similar oppression. This passage appeared in the 1971 issue of Gay Liberator:

[https://i.imgur.com/nvzCt7W.png](https://i.imgur.com/nvzCt7W.png)

**How is freedressing different from crossdressing?**

I prefer to avoid the term crossdressing for the simple fact that it upholds binary gender stereotypes, and applies disproportionately to feminine gender expression. So in 2004, I coined the term ""freedressing"" and launched the Freedressing Campaign, because guys deserve fashion freedom just as much as girls.

**Are gender nonconforming people really at risk of discrimination?**

Numerous studies have concluded that gender nonconforming youth, particularly feminine boys, are at elevated risk of harassment, depression, and suicidal ideation.

A study by JAMA Pediatrics revealed that of 6,082 high school students, gender nonconforming females were at 22 percent higher than average risk of mental illness but gender nonconforming males were at an astonishing 55 percent higher than average risk of mental illness. And it doesn't end there. Gender nonconforming females were 52 percent more likely to plan for suicide whereas gender nonconforming males were 79 percent more likely to plan for suicide and also twice as likely as their female counterparts to attempt suicide.

In 2017, The Williams Institute at UCLA conducted the first comprehensive survey of gender nonconforming youth in California. Of the participants, one in four teens said their classmates viewed them as resisting dominant forms of gender expression. The study determined that high school students perceived by their peers to be noticeably gender ambiguous experienced over double the average levels of psychological distress than their peers (18% versus 7%).

The *GLSEN 2015 National School Climate Survey* revealed that lesbian, gay, and bisexual students don’t just get bullied for their sexual orientation, but moreso for their gender expression. This disparity was prevalent even in schools with an LGBTQ inclusive curriculum.

The Human Rights Campaign's 2012 survey *Supporting and Caring for our Gender-Expansive Youth* further highlights the particular dangers that gender nonconforming youth altogether face:

*""Gender expression is the initial, often primary, source of harassment, discrimination, and violence that confronts many of our youth. Quite simply, children and youth perceived to be different in their gender are often targeted by their peers. While lesbian, gay, bisexual youth experience significant levels of harassment and bullying related to their sexual orientation, the levels re even higher for those who defy gender conventions and expectations.""*

**How exactly are gender nonconforming people marginalized?**

Gender nonconforming people are marginalized for defying sex-based stereotypes. Sex-based stereotypes also underlie the stigmas and biases that led to decades of systemic inequities for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people.

The Supreme Court of the United States came to this very conclusion in the case of *Bostock v. Clayton County (2020)*. That ruling hinged on the 1989 SCOTUS case of a gender nonconforming woman who was denied a job promotion because she looked and acted too ""manly"".

[https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2019/04/24/boom-lawyered-price-waterhouse-v-hopkins-edition/](https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2019/04/24/boom-lawyered-price-waterhouse-v-hopkins-edition/)

In other words, it was determined that a trans woman and a gay man are deserving of equal employment rights under federal law because a masculine woman had previously secured those same rights. Thus legal precedent had been established that discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and gender nonconforming people are all rooted in sex-based stereotypes.

Go back a few more years to 2015, and you can see that countless LGBTQ organizations confirmed that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, *and* gender nonconforming people are deserving of equal rights under the Equality Act:

[https://i.imgur.com/gB4pPf5.png](https://i.imgur.com/gB4pPf5.png)

That same year, HuffPost reported that gender nonconforming youth, alongside transgender youth, suffer high rates of discrimination and violence, and therefore LGBTQ organizations must collaborate to address that crisis:

[https://i.imgur.com/iZwc0Kj.png](https://i.imgur.com/iZwc0Kj.png)

**Do gender nonconforming people really need a day of visibility?**

If you look at queer history over the past 50 years, some of the loudest voices calling for trans liberation were actually drag queens, drag kings, gay crossdressers, butch lesbians and other gender nonconformists.

Even Holly Boswell, the designer of the transgender symbol, recognized the importance of bridging the gap between crossdressers and transsexuals as far back as the 1990s.

[https://tgforum.com/i-didnt-know-holly/](https://tgforum.com/i-didnt-know-holly/)

Leslie Feinberg believed that diversity of gender expression was essential to combating gender-based oppression and therefore advanced the idea of a ""transgender umbrella"".

[https://jessieraefisher.medium.com/be-trans-read-leslie-feinberg-f3d45a2a40ee](https://jessieraefisher.medium.com/be-trans-read-leslie-feinberg-f3d45a2a40ee)

**It's not like defying gender roles is anything special, right?**

You might be surprised to know that the original trailblazers of transgender rights didn't hold this view. Many believed it to be the exact opposite -- achieving freedom of gender expression was of critical importance to transgender liberation.

In fact, gender nonconforming people have long been the catalyst for major strides in LGBTQ rights -- like Storme DeLarverie, the butch lesbian and drag king that is credited with being the first to resist arrest during the police raid at the Stonewall Inn in 1969, or Lee Brewster, the gay crossdresser and drag queen that campaigned to successfully repeal New York City's anti-crossdressing ordinance in the early 1970s, or like like Marsha P. Johnson, the gay crossdresser and drag queen that co-founded the the nation's first homeless shelter for transgender and gender nonconforming people in 1970, or like Leslie Feinberg, the butch lesbian that published a manifesto formally announcing the creation of a transgender rights movement in 1992.

Queer theorists like Judith Butler and Ricki Anne Wilchins also point to overt acts of crossdressing as a means to disrupt the socially contrived categories of gender and sexuality for the benefit of both men and women alike.

For this reason and others, I think what genderqueer and gender nonconforming people are doing is instrumental, particularly within the context of LGBTQ rights.",sorcerykid,t2_2hegxf0f,1.0,1,0

I'm in soooo much mental anguish....

My life partner and I have been married for 8 years and I have butted heads with SEVERAL of his family members. He is a Cis gender straight Jewish man and I have battled his family for my Spirituality since Day 1 as well as many other things. 
They also were very inconsiderate when it came to mental or physical health and can be very biased in general. 


I'm AFAB but identify as Genderqueer with They/Them pronouns. I do not identify with AFAB pronouns or anything close to it.
I came out under the Trans Umbrella over 3 years ago as Non Binary first but it never felt right nor did Genderfluid so I eventually chose Genderqueer.

I told my Life Partners mom since 
Day 1 over 3 years ago what my pronouns are (They/Them) and I told his Dad as well. 

His father told me to my face ""I will never use your pronouns, I believe in the English language and I will never change""... and then he walked away. After he would look me in the face and deliberately call me AFAB pronouns. Not much longer after him walking away and went without talking, his father had a stroke and has been in the hospital for over a year and now he's in hospice ...

My Life Partners mother has every step of the way deliberately not using my pronouns. 
And one excuse is ""Oh I'm trying "" even though it's been over 3 years and she NEVER sticks to it... 
Another excuse is when I tell her how long it had been since I came out under the Trans Umbrella and how she should know my pronouns by now she tries to deny the length of time and tries to be the BIGGEST know-it-all and tries to be in control of it. And when I defend myself she gets defensive. 
She even tried to put her two cents in about what I wear....that she got to choose what clothes is for what gender and just because I wear masculine clothes and I'm AFAB means nothing. She wanted to dictate all of it....made me feel very small..


Now today I found out from my Life Partner after he talked with his mom.... that she doesn't want to use They/Them pronouns because she feels that  ""They"" is referring to having more than one person inside of me.....
That I'm not me because of who I am... That I'm something evil or possessed ...Idk..
And that she wants to distance herself from me...
All because I defended myself and just want to be me...

I have done sooooo much for.my Life Partners family since Day 1....so many arguments.....soooo many tears....
I have been the only one in the family that would talk to his mom about everything....I would be there for his mom through all the familys hardships....I communicate with her about everything all the time but it's NEVER enough....

I feel sooooooo incredibly lost....
His mom finally after we were married for over 6 years said that I was a great fit for her son and everything....
Now I feel that it was all a lie...

Any guidance or anything appreciated..

1122,187z7ee,2023-12-01,genderqueer,Am looking for opinions,"So I've always considered myself a cis male. However, I'm not very masculine. I don't remotely identify as a woman but I've been seeing and taking different gender tests on Reddit and elsewhere and I keep scoring high on feminine traits which led me to start questioning my gender. Like significantly higher than masculine traits although I'm not effeminate. At least I don't think I am

I don't suffer from dysphoria but I do have an affinity for femboys and trans girls but don't wish this for myself. I don't want she/her pronouns. I'm fine with he/him but I think I prefer they/them. I dress stereotypically male

Basically I consider myself a man who's sensitive, emotional, nurturing, non-competitive, non-confrontational, etc. Just stereotypically feminine characteristics

Some tests have suggested, based on my answers, that I'm non-binary. While technically true, I've rejected that as other that behavior, I don't identify as female at all. I wondered if I was agender but given how I think of myself as male I rejected that too

So I'm kinda leaning towards genderqueer or maybe gender neutral. I'm basically a man who behaviorally acts like a woman without identifying as one

I know the ultimate decision how to consider myself rests with me but based on what I've shared here, would you consider me genderqueer? Or would you personally consider me as cis, just more in touch with my feminine side than your average guy?

1123,cqwldz,2019-08-15,genderqueer,Bigender self-sexism?,"I want to start by saying I'm going to reference some common Western stereotypes here, for the purpose of describing a potential problem. Seeing these stereotypes may aggravate some people.  


I was thinking about how a bigender person might over-explain their feelings or behaviors as either male or female to the point that they self-stereotype, possibly based on socio-typical features of their behavior. I wondered if this could be problematic in the realm of women's rights and other venues of humanism, where describing, say, care as female, logic as male or female, physical aggression as male might take away from the human element of behavior (that is, that anyone can act any way regardless of sex or gender). One might externally express these views, biasing for or against other people based on their sex. Or perhaps one could misrepresent one sex or another, with ideas that ""women do this"" when their behavior isn't, for example, feminine (IE, ""I am so ditsy; that's the girl part of me"").  


But I also wonder if it's the responsibility of someone who identifies a certain way, and thus interprets the world a certain way of their own, to beholden to the expectations of a society that considers them entirely otherly. Is it anyone's place to judge how someone views things in their own gender context, especially when those views are rare and often completely internal?

The legislation which sparked this issue in Canada is bill C-16:
>The enactment also amends the Criminal Code to extend the protection against hate propaganda set out in that Act to any section of the public that is distinguished by **gender identity or expression** and to clearly set out that evidence that an offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on **gender identity or expression** constitutes an aggravating circumstance that a court must take into consideration when it imposes a sentence.

Dr. Peterson is claiming that the new provisions would make using the wrong pronoun on a person an offence which could be punishable, and would therefore constitute an enforcement of correct speech which for to him and many others seems abhorrent. The university administration who was pressuring Dr. Peterson to stop earlier has actually relented and accepted to hold a debate on the matter in order to discuss the nuances of gender determination, pronoun usage, free speech and legislation relating to it. 
I really hope that this goes over well and presents both sides of the arguments sufficiently since it's impact could be significant. As he mentioned in his [previous video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmNKPL1Y4g0&feature=youtu.be&t=1485) it could be setting the standard and direction for many other educational facilities in the world.

My understanding is that gender is different from (biological) sex. If gender is not defined by biology then what is it? Are these labels of man and woman just linked to what society has told us they should be? Or is gender identity some kind of inner sense that everyone has? If a man is not defined by their biology then what are they defined by? What makes someone a man? Sorry for rambling a bit and probably not being very clear. Idk if I'm just missing something crucial but it doesn't make sense to me. Why does gender have to exist? Why can't everyone just be themselves regardless of a label? If a man is not necessarily masculine then why are they a man and not simply a person? Also this is not meant to offend anyone I'm just confused.

I am biologically female and happy with that, and to be honest it never occurred to me that I might be anything else until I learned more about nonbinary genders and thought, ""holy shit, this androgyny thing makes a whole lot of sense.""

I don't really consider looks a part of it, because I think the genderization of clothing/makeup/hair is ridiculous. It's all based on personality. I feel like I have many female and many male qualities. However, it's hard to tell whether these qualities can legitimately be characterized as either male or female or are just ones that come from society's idea of binary genders. In other words, how do I know if I'm truly androgynous or just a female who doesn't conform to stereotypical female traits? Or, since gender is a societal construction, is there even a difference between those two things?

If there isn't, I guess my decision on whether or not to call myself androgynous rests on whether doing so would be harmful or helpful to breaking down traditional gender roles. Like, if I call myself androgynous because of a few seemingly-male traits I have, does that just enforce the idea that anyone who doesn't fit the typical male or female image is nonbinary, thereby enforcing gender stereotypes?

1135,150wp9j,2023-07-16,genderqueer,The Dangers of signing the family protection bill into law to the LGBT community in Kenya,"Dear friends, we must join together in deep concern over the potential consequences that the proposed Family Protection bill holds for the LGBT community. The imminent signing of this bill into law raises alarming red flags that cannot be ignored. Here's why we need to act:

1️⃣ Infringement on Human Rights: The signing of the Family Protection bill jeopardizes the basic human rights of the LGBT community. By promoting discrimination and restriction of their rights to love and exist as they are, this bill threatens the core principles of equality and dignity that every person deserves.

2️⃣ Ignoring the Pluralistic Society: Our society thrives on diversity and respect for all its members. The Family Protection bill adopted a narrow definition of family, disregarding the reality of diverse family configurations that exist and failing to acknowledge the love and care that LGBT individuals and couples bring to the table.

3️⃣ Undermining the Well-being: The Family Protection bill sends a dangerous message that LGBT individuals and families are less deserving of protection and recognition. This not only generates a sense of exclusion and isolation but also exacerbates the mental health challenges faced by members of the LGBT community, leading to potential long-term consequences.

4️⃣ Hindering Social Progress: Embracing diversity and inclusivity is the pathway to a truly progressive society. By signing this bill into law, we not only sidestep progress that has been made in recognizing and accepting the rights of the LGBT community, but we also set a detrimental precedent for future legislation that could further marginalize and harm vulnerable populations.

5️⃣ Advocating for Love and Equality: It is crucial we stand in solidarity with our LGBT friends, neighbors, and family members. We must raise our voices against the Family Protection bill, advocating for love, acceptance, and equality for all. Every person, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, deserves to live free from discrimination and oppression.

Now is the time to act! Let's come together to protect the rights and dignity of the LGBT community by standing against the Family Protection bill. Together, we can create a world that celebrates diversity, fosters equality, and ensures every person, irrespective of their sexual orientation or gender identity, can live without fear or discrimination.",Festo254,t2_qnuveuxp,0.98,44,0
1136,o4kars,2021-06-21,genderqueer,These are some terms I'm using to promote gender diversity. Please feel free to share :),"Over the years I've noticed a lot of conflicting terminology in LGBTQ discourse, particularly neologisms from the past 30 years. At times the meanings are logically inconsistent, depending on what source is being referenced. Sadly, this makes communication of gender-related concepts very difficult.

I've come to settle on the following definitions, which I believe to be the most consistent in usage across various disciplines and practices, including legal, political, academic, and otherwise.

These are of course, just my suggestions. But I hope through the application of more consistent terminology, we can more effectively embrace gender diversity and promote full equality.

* **gender diverse (adj)** \- a broad descriptor for people that expand the cultural meanings and understandings of gendered embodiment, including transgender, nonbinary, genderqueer, gender nonconforming, intersex, and third-gender persons.
* **gender expansive (adj)** \- a descriptor for people with a multi-dimensional gender narrative or experience, often used in reference to youth
* **gender minority (n)** \- a member of society, or a demographic sample, that is marginalized or disenfranchised on the basis of their gender variant status.
* **gender nonconforming (adj)** \- a descriptor for people that defy binary gender stereotypes; this extends to gender-related self-conception, personality, appearance, behavior, mannerisms, and other characteristics that are traditionally coded as masculine or feminine.
* **gender creative (adj)** \- a descriptor for people that defy binary gender stereotypes but are not otherwise transgender or nonbinary; this extends to gender-related self-conception, personality, appearance, behavior, mannerisms, and other characteristics that are traditionally coded as masculine or feminine.

Note: Most LGBTQ publications still use the term ""gender nonconforming"" in research and advocacy. I recommend gender creative or gender expansive be used instead.

Note: Some LGBTQ publications insist on describing gender minorities in the very limited framework of identity and expression, which can potentially erase more complex queer narratives and experiences, particularly as it pertains to the process of questioning and coming out. Therefore, I refrained from citing these two terms in any of the foregoing definitions.",sorcerykid,t2_2hegxf0f,0.92,69,39

1140,hmkb3v,2020-07-07,genderqueer,"Since when did ""femboy"" become a designation for passing as as a girl/woman?","When I came out in 1999 as genderqueer, labels like femboy, femme, girly boy, Nancy boy, sissy boy all referred to boys/men (oftentimes gay or bi) that embraced aspects of femininity whether in dress, mannerisms, speech, etc. There were no undertones of social or physical transitioning.

However, in recent years it seems that the ""femboy"" descriptor is being co-opted more and more by trans girls. Not only that, but I've noticed a growing emphasis on passing. This became clear to me after I was regularly downvoted and ridiculed for posting pictures of myself to femboy subreddits, since I don't adhere to binary gender stereotype of womanhood. I just look like an effeminate boy.

Last night someone even went out of their way to create a throwaway account to condemn me, stating  *""You don't pass. Again, YOU DON'T PASS. You need truth and I'm here to give you it. You are terrifying... Use this to better yourself and dare I say don't even try to do anything ever because you'll never pass.""*

So I'm curious if anyone has a hypothesis on why this passing requirement is suddenly taking hold in the femboy community. And what can be done to give boys/men more options to explore femininity, without them being pressured into a binary gender stereotype of womanhood just to do so?",sorcerykid,t2_2hegxf0f,0.98,104,42
1141,cta153,2019-08-21,genderqueer,"U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether workplace protections apply to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender employees under the Civil Rights Act.","It sounds good in principle. After all, who doesn't want full equality for all LGBTQ people? Except I discovered a glaring oversight: Every article I've read reports that the three cases under consideration will only address sexual orientation and gender identity -- not gender  expression. This has the potential to expose a loophole for employers to discriminate against gender nonconforming people that are not gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.

Of course it depends on how the judges interpret the meaning of ""sex"" in the Civil Rights Act. Ideally their ruling will be consistent with Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins (1989) which says that employers can't use sex-based stereotypes when taking employment actions. In that scenario, all LGBTQ people would be part of a single protected class. But in the off-chance that the judges opt for narrower meaning, that could spell a major setback since a large segment of gender variant people nowadays are not transgender (according to multiple different studies).

Only time will tell I guess, since the judges don't even reconvene till October. But I'm crossing my fingers for a favourable outcome that will ensure equal workplace protections for all of us, not just some of us.",rkrause,t2_9hia6,0.99,75,12

First things first, I’ve never posted on Reddit. Sorry for how long this is ended up being, but I really want help & feedback. Warning, my anxiety got the best of me during some of this.


Background info: Live in Australia, am 18 but 14-16 on the inside, born male, have a muscular disability that prevents walking but still allows for full leg movement atm, am a bit overweight but have gained very little in the last 4 years, my name is genderless, am female in 99% of games that give the option and on social media, have major voice cracks and a loud ugly masculine voice that isn’t deep, and I have a hard time talking about sensitive/embarrassing topics.


Over a year ago I started thinking I wanted to be female but realized “I can’t get bottom surgery so what's the point”. Since I can’t walk I can’t get myself to the toilet and it’s not worth all the trouble just to number 1 (even censored I feel icky saying it) so I need to use bottles, which requires the male body part. At the time I just accepted who I was and did my best to support other LGBTQ+ people.

6-8 months ago while home alone I just started stuffing my shirt with things to try and replicate the look of having breasts, and rolling my shirt up to act as a crop top. One of the many items I used was a padded bra that I found by looking (embarrassingly) through my mother’s drawers, that was to small to do up so it just sat best it could inside my shirt. As well as that I would wear socks pulled all the way up. It felt fun and freeing to dress the opposite gender. I stopped for a few months cause (me speaking to myself) “It’s not healthy cause you can’t possibly present as female the 99% of your life that you’re not alone”, but got back into doing it the past month.

On Friday the 12th I was once again left alone on my parent’s bed (at some point their room became the entertainment room). As usual I go into mothers draw to get the padded bra, but I try looking for anything else I may want to try on and found a skirt. I put it on over my shorts and pulled up socks and oh my gosh it felt magical. That night I got the courage to actually ask mother if she had any skirts or stockings (she hasn’t worn any for a long time) that I could try on, she asked why but all I could respond with was “I don’t know” & “I want to experiment”, but I‘m pretty sure she got the idea cause she said we could look through the draws sometime.

On Saturday I asked for a pair of socks to cut open so I could extend another pair to create over the knee stockings and I loved the feeling of them. I wore them all day and no one commented: dad didn’t notice, mother didn’t care, brother didn’t say anything (I think he didn’t notice). As with the day before I was once again left alone on parents’ bed, but this time I had knee high socks, a skirt skirt, and a padded bra for the whole fit and it was great.

On Sunday I told mum I wanted her help with finding “stuff“ (doubt she knew what I meant), but when it came time I chickened out cause my brother was home. I feel like I’ll be more comfortable explaining to him why I’m in a skirt then why I want to look in mother’s draw. I did make a necklace with a piece of jewellery I bought a bit ago; mother & brother thought it looked good and dad once again didn’t notice.

Monday was just high socks & the necklace all day. That night I was watching trans memes and decided to take several quizzes on gender & sexuality. My sexuality came up as aro/ace on every quiz just as I thought, but my gender came up as multigender, genderfluid, and non-binary which has made me question things.

Tuesday again nothing eventful happened, wore just normal pulled up socks and the necklace. I wanted some perspective from others who have gone through this, so I turned to Reddit to make this post.


That's my story so far, so I’ll elaborate a few things.
* My mother is really supportive of me and understands some people are born into the wrong body.
* My father loves us a lot, but hates trans surgery so idk how he’d react since no surgery will be involved. Honestly, he just doesn’t understand these things.
* My brother has several LGBTQ+ friends, one who is a fully trans male. 
* The skirt I found and love is a bit short, but I’m okay with wearing shorts underneath, the ones I wear are really comfortable and look gender neutral.  


I've worried that wearing female clothes was just a high because it felt forbidden, which led to me taking the quizzes and really think about who I am. I’ve never been masculine at all except laughing at the word balls (not proud about it), but I’ve never considered myself feminine despite my clothes preference. I figured out that I’ve just never put all my “feminine” likes together (I know this is stereotyping): girly tv shows, jewellery, fashion, colourful wristbands, sparkles, unicorns, dressing up, crafting, roleplaying as females, “white girl music”, dancing (until my leg muscles went caput about 6 years ago), and even appearing as a girl in some dreams. Even so I don’t feel either gender in day-to-day life, the way I feel changes based on mood and activity, but maybe actually wearing female clothes will help.

I don’t know how coming out is going to go. First, I need to actually sit down with mother to look through her draw and find the skirt that I’ve been using, and then act like I’ve never seen it before, let alone worn it. School starts on Monday so my brother will be gone, that’s the perfect time to try and put a look to come out with. I think I’ll just wear it while he’s out for the first week so that I’m used to wearing it by the time he knows. I don’t know what to do with my father, what’s funny is he often says I scream like a girl (I do), so time to fulfil the prophecy I guess. I’ll buy some skirts for myself in a good size ASAP after the trial week. I don’t think I’m much a dress person (there’s one I really love tho), I quite like oversized shirts. I like crop tops, but probably won’t go down that route cause I have a bit of tummy fat that being disabled makes impossible to lose; it’s invisible to me when I’m alone, but being around people makes it real. I do want fake breasts somehow, but if a skirt makes my father freak then fake breasts will straight up kill him.  


I have a few questions for whoever can help me.
* Should I wait a month or two before (awkwardly) asking my mother for a bra and wearable breasts, just to make sure cross dressing is my thing? Any solutions to achieving decent looking fake breasts on a $30-40au budget? My thinking was stuffing a bra, but would this be seen as over the top or creepy? (https://www.target.com.au/p/milly-minimiser-bra/63113181)
* How would I create cleavage if I want that?
* How does one use a toilet in a dress without it touching the toilet?
* I have big calf muscles, I assume there are tights and stocking made for that?
* Do I consider myself trans or is there a better word?


If this works in the long run should I get hormone treatments? Would it stuff up the male body part that I require? Can you stop taking it once you're happy with your body? How long has it taken you to grow decent breasts? Does it stop facial hair from growing? Most importantly, how is treatment actually done?


I know I can google a lot of these things, but would rather hear from the community and the little research I tried to do just made my brain hurt.  
That’s all I got right now, I hope this is found by enough people. ",PandaStudio1413,t2_kxgzxs023,0.76,9,10

Help me the rest of the way?","I am going to share with you my raw notes and please just tell me if you think I'm misunderstanding anything.

#Sexualities:

**Pansexual** -- have never been with a binary female, but have been attracted to women as a teen.  have had 2-3 experiences with one binary female that deeply aroused me but did not lead to sex

**Polysexual** -- if i am not pansexual and it turns out i am not attracted to non binary women, then I am polysexual, due to being attracted to men, being gynesexual (but not necessarily on a non binary woman, on man) and then skoliosexual:

**Skoliosexual** -- i was with a FTM that i was very attracted to.  had his vagina but not his boobs, but had hair on chest and legs that i loved.  so was deeply attracted that mixture.  have never gone all the way with a binary woman so it's hard to say if im pansexual truly.

**Sapiosexual** -- have found myself with military officers that have an intoxicating affect on me that makes me surrender all logic and everything due to the intelligence and power they command.

i also find myself, on the other side, deeply attracted to nerdy girls!  i know that's simple but i actually love the authenticity of girls with no makeup, glasses, maybe some extra pounds, maybe not, but i think it's the sincerity and intelligence they have, but again, i haven't tested this.

**Sociosexual** -- i have desire to have sex while in a relationship with others outside of the relationship typically due to the multiple needs as shown above


****

#Genders

I have high-functioning autism and epilepsy and it's made everything a little different for me.

***

**Gender Fluid / Bi Gender / DemiFlux / Genderflux / Genderqueer / Non-binary** -- II realize that when playing the submissive role with a man, 75% of the time I will literally become a woman.  i am no longer a man.  25% of the time i submit as a man to another man.  homosexual submission, homosexual domination, and then either transgender/heterosexual domination are the three types of sex i seek out and im trying to identify how my gender plays into these desires.

***

**Gender Non-comformity / Gender variant / Two Spirit** -- very emotional but do not need emotions to have sexual relationships, but find myself very in touch with my emotional side in a feminine way, easy to cry, but i have a full beard, keep all my natural body hair and generally love masculine values even if i am not a traditional man in any way imaginable.... im almost lumbersexual but not with the fashion, just in attitude.  but i have epilepsy so my hands shake.  

**Genderpunk** -- i know it sounds stupid but i really love listening to music that gay men or women would enjoy and in the area i live that means really sharing an intimate side of your identity (and ultimately exposing you as very effeminate).  and lately i feel empowered to sing along because i feel it's deeper than anything, i feel like im connecting with the soul of the musician.  like it just goes so much deeper than anything and in singing and connecting with the effeminate (or sometimes excessively masculine, like in rap or even metal).  for me this always felt very punk in this way i couldn't describe till now

***

**Aliagender / Aporagender** -- XEN -- i am a SPIRIT, beyond man and woman.... when im in this place i am asexual.  then outside of this headspace i encompass some aspects of both man and woman (That last part is my personal understanding of it, but it is not what you would describe the definition as, yet having your own personal definition is the definition itself of alia/apora/gender -- as long as it is a powerful gender-based force)

****

#Conclusions

**Poly Gender / Quad gender** -- the above sections could just mean im polygender: 

part aporagender, 

part gender fluid, 

part gender variant/gender punk, 

part male

1148,w83zu6,2022-07-26,genderqueer,"No physical dysphoria (?), but very trans behaviour. Considering transitioning - advice? (19/ftm?) PLEASE READ FIRST"," Where do I start. I'm 19 and considering transitioning to male. This isn't a decision I'm taking lightly, and I'm trying to examine and consider all of my feelings and life experiences to decide if this is the correct decision for me:

My parents were always very relaxed and progressive, and raised me as a girl, but in a very gender neutral way - I played with girl and boy toys, and never dressed especially masculine or feminine. Unrelated to gender identity, I've always been quite a neutral person in terms of hobbies and such. 
I never felt dysphoria as a kid, but ever since I was on the playground I'd always want to roleplay as a male character (around age 5 or so). This continued until I was a tween, where I still continually identified with male characters rather than female ones. Every Halloween I wanted to be something genderless or something male. Etc. Around age 12 I began crossdressing in secret, although all my attempts were pretty poor. I also recently found a video of me attempting to do voice masculinisation exercises from when I was 12, that clearly comes from a FTM source. 
A few years later when I was about 15 or so I had my first big 'trans' phase - I never socially transitioned or anything, but for a few months I was absolutely fixated on getting a haircut (which I never did for a couple of external reasons), watching FTM top surgery videos and FTM media content in general. I made up a new hypothetical name for myself and a ""trans wishlist"" on my notesapp and crossdressed A LOT. But ultimately nothing came of it. I thought something along the lines of ""why bother"" because living as a girl was tolerable. I never felt dysphoria about my body, my breasts/genitals etc never caused me any bother. So I didn't see the point of going through so much distress and effort to transition.
After this, mostly due to social pressures at school I went through a hyperfeminine phase (still a lot less feminine than the average girl) but I wore eyeliner every day and had long hair and occasionally wore skirts, etc. I was about 17 at this point. But after school ended I immediately stopped it all. No more makeup or feminine clothes or anything. I didn't feel the need to perform femininity anymore because my social environment had changed, so I stopped. I would still crossdress from time to time, even more so after school ended. I would tuck my hair into a hat and put on a big coat and take long walks outside and deep down hope I'd be clocked as male. 
When I started university, the need to perform hyperfeminity flared up again and I'd occasionally wear eyeliner and present femme again, but I kept getting more and more ""non binary urges"" as I jokingly called it at the time. I was feeling more and more urge to cut my hair and change my presentation, and this time after months of consideration I finally did. I started off considering myself an NB woman, then just NB after my haircut. I started to renew my wardrobe with much more masculine clothes to the point where they're the only clothes I wear now. I even bind occasionally, but more to increase my chance of being clocked as male, not because my breasts make me dysphoric. I got my close friends to start referring to me with they/them pronouns, and so far everything feels much better. I'm always taking pictures in the mirror, admiring myself and feeling confident and happy even though I know I'm much less conventionally attractive than I was before. 
ID-ing as NB is much nicer, but I think deep down I've always considered it a stepping stone for a full binary FTM transition. I don't want surgery, but everything HRT changes is appealing to me. I've been blessed with hairy generics pre-t and love having body hair. I workout at the gym, I love presenting masc, and taking T and living fully as a male sounds so appealing to me. Not just exciting, but ...fulfilling? But I still don't experience physical dysphoria, so I don't understand these feelings.
I've heard stories of trans guys sleeping in binders, showering with the lights off, self harming, all kinds of mental anguish from their dysphoria and yet I've never felt that. If someone told me I absolutely had to live as a woman forever I'd be bummed out but I could cope with it fine. I've been out as NB for about 6 months now and never felt better. I want to take things slowly and thoughtfully, so I'm giving it a full year before I see what steps to take next - although I am considering asking my close friends to try out he/him pronouns for me in a few months time. Transition isn't something I'm taking lightly, even if it is a very exciting prospect to me.

Male-ness has always had some bizzare intrinsic appeal to me. I've always been obsessed with male characters to the point of disinterest in female ones (especially in my early teenage years). But this isn't me trying to emulate something I'm attracted to because sexually and romantically I'm much more into women. I have no trauma regarding girlhood and no internalised misogyny whatsoever. I'm not trying to run or escape from anything. I don't have depression or anxiety. I have no idea what could be causing me these feelings because I really don't experience physical dysphoria at all. Was I just progressively socialised enough to view men having afab bodies as normal? Am I just hardwired to not care? The last six months has been great, but I do feel incredibly embarrassed talking to anyone IRL about my gender feelings. But I think that's just the kind of person I am - I was very shy and nervous to tell my extremely accepting and loving parents that I was bi, and equally nervous to tell my loving and accepting friends that I was NB.

So yeah. Any advice on other things I should consider or look into? Any opinions or insight would be truly appreciated.",jackrabbit985,t2_92exzly1,0.97,53,13
1149,11gzqtl,2023-03-03,genderqueer,DAE binary gender but also believes gender roles are made-up and don’t define your gender?,"Looking to understand the experiences of others here to add context to my own.

I’m a cis lady, mid-40s, very certain about being a lady, and equally certain that it’s not my alignment (or misalignment) with gender norms that settles this. My personality and interests have always been a mix of stereotypically feminine and stereotypically masculine, but I never thought that I WAS a boy, or ought to have BEEN a boy, or would want to fool people into thinking I was a boy… I just wanted what the boys had. I wanted to not be restricted to “stuff that is for girls” by other people.

So I am trying to figure out if genderqueer or GNC is a label I want to use to help explain myself to others, and I see a lot of people who do use those labels saying things like “sometimes I feel masc and sometimes I feel femme” or “I feel like I’m somewhere in between male and female” or they’ll describe dressing one way or the other and like… I don’t fully get that. 

I can certainly understand dressing along stereotype lines in order to affect the way you’re perceived. It also totally makes sense to dress the way you damn well feel like because you like those clothes and stereotypes be damned. Sometimes ya just want to be pretty!

But like… that all seems to me like presentation, not identity. When you say your internally-felt gender changes, holy crap, what is that LIKE? I always just feel like me. The label “woman” fits and “man” does not. Having that change seems to me like it would be just… super unsettling? Like having a different name almost? “Yesterday I felt like a Michelle, but today I think I’m more of a Sylvia.” (No shade to multiple personality systems, that’s just not what I want to discuss here.) Non-commital makes a certain kind of sense, but is that more about not feeling the male/female stereotypes don’t fit you and you don’t want to be stuck in either box, or is it literally being somewhere else entirely, gender-wise?

I am 14 (nearly 15) and afab and (currently) identify as a girl, she/they pronouns, and a lesbian. 

However, i sometimes just really hate the idea of being a girl. Like REALLY hate it. And idk why? But then sometimes, Im like i am totally a girl why am i even questioning it? Sometimes i feel like a boy a lot but then i also feel like i am really not a boy at all. Same with nonbinary.

 It is very confusing and i am also questioning if i am a lesbian, bi or pan, so the stereotypes of all of the sexualities makes me think i am not questioning gender at all and am instead fitting the stereotypes (like lesbians liking to present more masculine). But i wanna present as feminine, masculine and androgenous at different times, as well as sometimes all at the same time. It is very confusing and i dunno. 

Its the same with my breats? Sometimes im happy i have breats that are like medium size as they are feminine and sometimes i just look in the mirror and cry wishing i was born a male. But then i think about being born a male and then i wanna be born a female? Idk.
Weirdly the thing i have the most issues with is my legs? I feel like they look really feminine and i HATE it. I want them to look like amab legs if u know what i mean? I hate how they connect with the hips and just everything about them makes me want to scream and shout and cry?

I dont know if im being silly or if im just going mad or am genuinely going through gender dysphoria or something but whatever is happening i dont like it at all and its making me feel really uncomfortable?

My older sister is trans and ik she faces stuff like this but idk if im faking it or just a bit confused or (lmao cant believe im saying this) if its just a phase? But like genuinely ik shes been through issues like this so i feel like - idk what i feel. I just feel invalid due to the issues she faces day to day because shes trans due to dysphoria and discrimination and it makes me feel sad for her. Like i should just not ever mention my feelings because i am clearly a girl not anythin else and would be offending her by faking it. But then just typing 'i am clearly a girl' felt wrong because i dont feel like one.

Anyway, i will probably delete this because im writing this at 3am and i hate talking about my feelings, especially publicly, but if anyone does have some tips or advice or anything that can reassure me it would be greatly appreciated.

1152,12x3xud,2023-04-24,genderqueer,Working through gender-related trauma has not changed how genderqueer I am.,"I grew up with multiple layers of toxicity, one of which is a form of toxic masculinity that really twisted my image of femininity. I was forced into frilly dresses and clothes that showed off my ""feminine figure"" growing up and told to be a ""lady."" In this case, ""lady"" meant sweet, tidy, well-groomed, well-mannered, homemaker, mother, wife. It was and still is nauseating. For the past few years I've been pushing back by dressing masculine/androgynous and I'm way more comfortable that way. I don't have dysphoria but I don't feel myself when I'm made to act ""ladylike."" 

Becoming friends with femme queers has been a trip and a half. Seeing people find joy in things that are pretty, flowery, pink, and otherwise girly made me realize that femininity did not mean the things my family taught me it meant. There are many ways to be a woman and not all women fit into the stereotypical ""lady"" or ""girly"" archetypes. 

So, then, I thought to myself, if a woman can be anything under the sun, why consider myself genderqueer, especially if I don't have dysphoria? 

Since I was a kid I have never cared much about gender when it came to anything, until it was drilled into my head. Even then, I never understood it on the visceral level that others did. I just knew that if I hung out with the boys people would call me funny names so it was best to hang out with the girls for now. I easily identified with fictional characters of all genders in the same way. 

There are parts of me that are masculine and androgynous and other things I don't quite have labels for. Embracing the part of me that is feminine does not replace them, it just adds to the party. 

Heh. Part-y. 

Because I'm traumatized and queer I've thought for a long time that my queerness was just a trauma response, but as I'm healing I'm just getting queer-er. It's shocking how much of my personality was repressed or stunted in my childhood.",mylifeisathrowaway10,t2_99qbzhdo,0.99,89,8

1156,wtbhcb,2022-08-20,genderqueer,Deeply questioning what it means to be a woman,"So I've been questioning my femininity and gender for the past month or so now. It's been completely disruptive in my life, and I have yet to find true peace in how I identify myself.

I've never had an ounce of doubt with my womanhood until recently. In fact, I've always embraced the feminine and found solace in the beautiful diversity that comes with being a woman. I know I've felt different, but that's only because I am a plus size Black woman who was raised around predominantly white people, who oftentimes where skinner and shorter than me. That would throw me off at times, but it never made me question my femininity or womanhood.

Lately, I've been feeling a little disconnected from my womanhood. I've been feeling like I'm not the same kind of woman as the women around me. Which is true, but I hate the idea of divorcing myself from womanhood overall. 

I do identify as a lesbian, and being with women and non-men has totally reshaped what it means to be a woman and how I embrace womanhood. It feels so good, but I still feel lost at times. 

I've been very protective of my womanhood in me going through this, as I feel like if I were to explore my expression, I would lose everything that I've done and have worked so hard for. I do acknowledge I have a ot of internalized misogyny, and maybe misandry. I don't want to stifle myself and I want to explore, but most of the time I just want to be a woman and not have to go through what I'm going through. 

I've been very sensitive towards gendered things lately, which I absolutely hate even admitting to, but I feel everything just feels so much, you know? The pressure to have an answer and be confident with it is strong, even though it's just putting that pressure on myself. 

I acknowledge that I seem pretty destination focused, and haven't been able to embrace the journey as it is. My therapist told me that things can be both and, not necessarily either or. Thinking that way has helped me embrace the different facets of what it means to be human, without having to sacrifice the things that bring me joy. It's been difficult to remind myself that, but it's helped me a lot.

I would love your help on my upcoming fashion project:

What are your thoughts on gender identity and social norms relating the human body?
What do you think about expectations of the body to perform a certain gender role / beauty standard?

Is it possible to completely erase the binary system and is gender only a social construct? 


Does undyed fabric in the context of the body remind you of skin color?
If so, is it less diverse if only these colors are used for costumes (bc they are light so then referring to light skin)?
Or is it discriminating if the fabrics are purposely colored in different skin tones ? 


Is it discriminating, if body parts that fall out of the social construct of beauty, are displayed and/ or exaggerated (micro penis / „fat suits“ / boobs / vulvas / curves)? 


My aim is to show bodies that fall out of the binary  and / or beauty norm.
To raise questions about these constructs and norms and to display various body shapes and mix genders.
I want to mix gender specific body parts and and exaggerated body shapes and displace them to create abstract sculptures.

I am a Cis gender female. Mom of 3. Female wife to a male husband. I never questioned these titles before. As a child I was a ""tom boy,"" a term I now find insulting.

 In spite of all my worldly titles, I have never fit the stereotype of ""girl"" or ""woman."" Since becoming a mom, however, I've embraced my femininity and feminine self- I created life and birthed 3 humans. I am proud of the things my body can do in the way it was formed.

I think the binary culture I exist in is bull shit.  

Onto the next adventure...I've recently embarked on an ENM relationship. As I am learning more about and falling into somewhat of a rhythm with my partner, I'm seeing he has many of the gender fluid (traditionally female/submissive) characteristics my husband has. Both of these men (one a contractor one a chef) make me happy and feel complete and attractive for who/what I am. 

I love and support my non binary, Trans, homosexual friends. And I don't want to draw attention towards myself in the quest for better cultural acceptance of ""non traditional"" folks. But I also feel like I want my community to know that I'm different too.

I just read a post about a Cis person questioning and leading back to Cis. Maybe that is me too? 
Just because I want to be the big spoon and my partners want to be the little spoon doesn't change my gender identity (a silly example among the dozens of  non traditional relationship roles). But maybe my gender identity is ready for a re evaluation?

1164,enb602,2020-01-11,genderqueer,the “male lesbian”,"I’ve been thinking about this concept for a while, and I finally googled it today and came across an [urban dictionary entry](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Male%20Lesbian) that described exactly what I feel. I wanted to get a pulse if others out there feel the same way.

I’m male, and I don’t assume to understand how lesbians relate to each other, but the dynamic is curious to me. I often don’t like what I see in hetero relationships. It feels hierarchical rather than equal, and I think straight women actually prefer it that way and expect men to take a more domineering role (or sometimes reverse role). I’d rather be in relationship where we’re best friends and manage our own shit. I cringe when women are the man’s therapist in a relationship.

The male stereotype is repulsive to me, and has been since I was a little kid. I like being in women’s company, and I prefer their activities. In conversation, I’m usually more interested in the woman’s perspective, and I find most guys boring, unintelligent, and uncivilized in comparison. I like to dress well, but not in the masculine sense. I prefer more androgynous or borderline feminine clothing.

I have no desire to become a woman physically (I’m not trans), and I prefer women partners (I’m not gay). At this point, multiple people have asked if I’m gay, but I’ve never been attracted to men. I’ve also found that having an emotional and intellectual connection with a woman is absolutely critical for me to feel attraction. Good looks literally don’t work, except in porn (but that’s a whole different reality). This again goes counter to the male stereotype.

1165,20q13k,2014-03-18,genderqueer,Am I genderqueer or just “femmephobic”?,"I don’t know what gender I identify as. I know I don’t feel comfortable being feminine, and I’m not happy with my female physical characteristics (in particular, breasts and periods). I feel like I have more masculine mental characteristics and tend to want a more masculine look, but I don’t think I really want certain male physical characteristics like a penis and facial hair either.

However, I do worry that what I’m identifying as feminine is based on stereotype rather than reality. Character traits that I feel make me masculine are primarily my assertive personality, my lack of interest in traditionally feminine things like makeup, fashion, and homemaking, and my interest in traditionally masculine things like military history and martial arts. Really, there’s no reason why those things should be assigned to men. I’ve always identified with male characters in fiction more, but I wonder if that’s just because female characters usually fall into stereotyped behaviour. I don’t want to fall into the “femmephobia” trap of thinking that feminine = bad.

As for my sexual orientation, I generally prefer masculine bodies, but I don’t really have any desire to have sex with anyone. I don’t have an aversion to sex and can definitely enjoy it in art and fiction, I’m just not that interested in actually doing it myself. I’ve had a male partner, mainly because I wanted to find out if I was missing out on anything, and it wasn’t an unpleasant experience but it wasn’t one I got much out of either. At times, I even found it tiresome to ""have to"" spend time with someone. We decided to break up because he wanted more intimacy and I wanted less.

I’ve got Asperger Syndrome and I’m going through a period of depression and identity confusion, which I’m pretty certain confuses things as well. I’m going to be starting a course of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy soon.

Right now, I don’t know what I am or where I fit in. I’m hoping that the CBT might give me some help, but asking people who’ve had similar experiences with questioning their gender identity seems like a good idea as well.

I've been having a really difficult time lately with the idea of my gender and where I fall on the spectrum. 

For context, my whole life I have been a straight male and that's all I present as. I've dipped my toes into bisexuality and it didn't work for me, and while I've grown up my entire life wishing I was a girl, it's never been (and continues not to be) something I see as an option to change. I am not exaggerating either, when I've talked to my mum about this she recalls when I was 4 years old verbalizing I was jealous when my sister was born a girl.

This all said, I don't willingly conform to masculine roles. I hate it. I hate it so much. I want to be soft, I want to love floral things, I want to be able to express myself in all the ways women can without judgement. I don't want to be expected to be the one to lead and initiate everything because I was born a man, I want the option to be submissive. I want to enjoy my massive plushie collection without feeling ashamed. I want to be with someone who doesn't leave me when they find out I'm not a stereotypical man. I'm just so tired of it all, and I don't even know if there's anything that can help really.

I denounce trans as an option simply because I am only attracted to lady parts and want a biological family. I also wouldn't want to do anything if I couldn't come out the other end looking undoubtedly female. It's all so scary, and expensive. I wish I could just be turned inside out and have *everything* change so I'd be a straight / bi / whatever with a woman's anatomy. I feel so cursed as I am.

The thing is, even if I identified openly as they/them, I don't know if my outward appearance would really change that much. I have no clue. I feel like I'd experience the same fear and judgement to be myself as I do now. Reality for me is that even while I live in a progressive area, we are always treated based on the way we look by the majority, that's unfortunately just how society works. So I almost fear I'd be worse off if I did anything besides be masculine presenting. But I'm *so tired* of the associated expectations. I don't even know if I'd want to wear any ""feminine"" clothing or accessories in my current body, it's generally not even something I allow myself to consider.

 I just hate gender roles. I hate that I was born this way. I hate that the answer isn't more clear to me. I wish I didn't want kids and I was attracted to men so I could transition without concern. I wish I could just do everything it takes to switch over without the fear of missing out on what I've wanted my whole life, a loving partner and family of my own.

So I have been really back and forth on whether I'm trans/genderqueer for a while now (I'm afab btw). I was away at college for two years and it was a wonderful time to explore my gender identity. I felt confident that I was genderqueer, but unfortunately, it came to an end and I needed to come home. My hometown is a pretty red/republican area so I have been hiding my transness and it's really made it question if I was actually trans. It's hard to confidently say you are trans when people are calling you ma'am to your face every day, I don't have the time or energy at work to fight with them so I just accept it and that was really messing with my head.

Recently I decided I wanted to hook up with someone, he is a cis straight man. Immediately that's already a really awkward dynamic since I hate it when people view me as a woman. Just before we started doing anything I decided that I wouldn't be bothered if I was viewed as a woman, I tried to make peace with the fact that, right now, that's just how the world saw me. Well, cut to when we actually started doing stuff, he called me a good girl and I immediately started crying LMAO. 

Even though it wasn't necessarily a fun interaction, it helped prove to me that I am indeed trans, and even if I tried to force myself to not believe it, it was still true. I am still trans, and I deserve to be perceived that way.

I hope this is an acceptable place to put this, I don't really know where to turn with this (or what to think about the whole thing really). My apologies if it's not. I'm using a throwaway account because my normal account shares it's name with majority of my online presence and is known to my friends and family (and I would like to keep this a secret from them, atleast for now). 

&nbsp;


With that out of the way, I'm a 30 year old guy who sometimes wishes he was a girl instead, and doesn't really now what to do or think about that. I've been trying to look things up online, but haven't found anything that I feel describes me. Majority of the time I have no issue with my sex/gender but sometimes I do - this seems to happen more often when when consuming media with female characters I like for one reason or another (personality, design, etc) and/or when I'm depressed (quick note on that - I'm using ”depressed” as a description because it's the most fitting one I've got. I have not been diagnosed with depression and likely wouldn't be because while everything else fits, my depressive periods - while fairly common - tend to be much shorter, usually only a few days at a time, max). I also often identify with female characters even when I don't particularily want to be female. I tried to research genderfluidity because it seemed like it might descibe the situation, but atleast based on what I've seen online most genderfluid people seem to feel like they *are* female/male when in those respective ”modes” rather than *wishing* they were like I do. But then again, I don't really feel very strongly about my gender even when it's not bothering me, so I don't know.  In the same vein I don't think trans fits me either as majority of the time I'm fine with my gender and I wouldn't want to be a woman all the time. I'd love it if could just switch it whenever I like, but that's not possible and like I mentioned i would't want to switch permanently. If described as either stereotypically male or female my interests, personality and appearance would all be in the male camp. I used to have some make up (basically just lipstick and nailpolish) and a crappy wig which I would sometimes experiment with at home but I got rid of those a couple of years ago because I felt ashamed and scared someone would find out and I'd have to explain them.

&nbsp;


On sexuality side (I apologise if bringing this up crosses a line, but atleast to me it feels very relevant to the issue at hand) I would describe myself as straight and exclusively attracted to women – there is only one exception to this which I'll get to in a bit. The relevant part is that for as long as I've consumed adult content I've liked content with transformation and transformation themes (games, pictures, sequences and so on), especially male-to-female transformation. This is also where that exception comes in – sometimes when consuming such content if at that time I also wish I was a woman I may get attracted to some male characters. This is fairly rare though and usually I'm only attracted to women regardless of how I feel about my gender.

&nbsp;

So there. The reason I decided to write this and ask for insigth and advice no is that it feels like recently these events have been a bit more frequent than is usual (so has my ”depression”) and because for the first time in my life (I've had both these thoughts and depressive periods ever since I was a teenager)I recently had one when I actually felt actively bad and sad about it rather than just idly wishing I was female.  So. Ito be perfectly honest I'm not even entirely sure what I'm trying to accomplish with this but I felt I had to put it out there in some way and figured this would be a good place.

For those of you who identify as non binary what does that mean to you? Because this is my take:


You're born male or female, that's encoded in your DNA it's something that can't be changed. You can have surgery to resemble the opposite gender (but that's trans so I won't get into that here) but aside from that you're male or you're female. Being male or female has nothing to do with your preferences. As a child we are hit with gender stereotypes blue for boys, pink for girls, dresses for girls, no dresses for boys but again that has nothing to do with you being male or female that's just gender stereotypes enforced on most of us since birth. 


So if you are a male and you enjoy dresses, makeup and nail polish, that doesn't make you a female or not a male, it just makes you a person that likes dresses, nail polish and makeup. If you're a female and you prefer not to wear dresses, wear jeans, baggy t-shirts, like to play football, don't wear makeup and cut your hair short that doesn't make you male and having a preference for all of those gender stereotypes doesn't make you both or none, it makes you a male or female that just likes those things. The gender stereotypes are created and have nothing to do with your gender. Back in history many men wore both pants and dresses and makeup, that didn't make them no gender,  that made them a male who wore pants, dresses and makeup. So I'm asking what is the purpose of identifying as non binary?

1172,iqbfq2,2020-09-10,genderqueer,I need help figuring out how to talk to my colleagues about the impact of gendered language on children (Cross-post)," 

Let me start by saying that I live in a fairly progressive state with colleagues who are all for social causes and promoting racial and gender equality. However, there are instances of gender-biased behavior that for many people doesn't register as a problem. Some examples (of which there are MANY more):

* Encouraging a boy to ""be a gentleman"" or praising him as one when he lets a girl have the first turn.
* Reinforcing parental gender roles (""Ask mommy to wash it when you get home"")
* Making comments about being ""big and strong"" specifically to boys
* Complimenting girls on their appearance (""What a beautiful dress!"" / ""You look so pretty today!"")
* For crafty projects, giving girls pink things and boys blue things
* Using words like ""Policeman"", ""Fireman"", ""Delivery man""
* Grouping students by gender and assigning directions based on gender (""**Boys**, when I say go, un-mute yourselves and ***growl*** the word ""hello"". **Girls**, when I say go, un-mute yourselves and ***sing*** the word hello."")

Some of these things are not directly discriminatory, but they do actively contribute to:

1. Making students aware of the social divide between genders, which leads them to think in terms of in-group and out-group and lends credence to the belief that each gender has its own strengths/traits/roles/expectations/opportunities
2. Making students aware of their own gender (Why is it even relevant in an educational setting?)
3. Teaching students the expected social roles and traits of their gender
4. Training the next generation to have gendered expectations that will alienate anyone who doesn't fit the mold

I know these teachers mean well, but I feel like this is not appropriate talk for the classroom. People just don't realize how pervasive and influential this kind of language is. And I feel like, for anyone who doesn't already think about the psychology of gender and language, the concern can come across as overly sensitive or as virtue-signaling from an aggressive uber-liberal. My question is this: **Is there a diplomatic way for me to bring up this issue and encourage increased awareness of the consequences of this type of classroom language?**",throwaway_slp,t2_nlxdv,0.96,72,8

I always think people should be able to live/be/identify how they want, but I don't really understand why someone would identify as genderqueer.  I realize that people who do identify that way feel that they don't fulfill all the stereotypical qualities of their assigned gender - that makes sense, and I think everyone falls on that spectrum somewhere of having both stereotypically masculine and feminine characteristics in various ratios.  But I think the idea that being masculine and/or a man means you have to be this way, while being feminine and/or a woman means you have to be this way, is harmful, and I wonder if if choosing to identify as genderqueer instead of, for example, identifying as a woman who is traditionally masculine in a lot of ways, actually reinforces those negative gender stereotypes.  Like if you're born a woman and you don't want to transition to living fully as a man, why not just say you're a masculine woman?  Wouldn't that be more helpful for doing away with negative gender stereotypes of what women and men are supposed to be?   Does that make sense?  I'm a cis straight white woman so I'm probably missing a lot of nuances to this.  I find it both interesting and confusing, so hopefully this doesn't come across as too idiotic.",hs764,t2_f2t09,0.82,7,42

(she is OK with the female pronoun and her female body)

I don't see any issues using the new vocabulary and the new name, just like she asked me to.  But I wonder, in general, is there anything else that one should be aware of in order to be respectful to gender-queer people?
It sounds that the main thing is that gender-queer don't want stereotypical treatment based on their ""gender assigned at birth"", but many of my friends, male as well as female, don't want to be stereotyped either...

I personally am trying to treat people the same way regardless of their gender, and to definitelly respect any specific things they ask of me.   Right now I am inclined to think that's exactly how I should treat my gender-queer friend as well - exactly the same as everyone else. 

I appreciate any thoughts on this topic, but I am hoping to hear from gender-queer people!

When I became a teenager, I enjoyed ""lady"" as well. But I don't like - have never liked - ""woman"". I don't feel like a woman. I never have felt like a woman. I don't see myself becoming a woman.

I always shrugged this off as a quirk of semantics until today when I read Tilda Swinton's Wiki entry where she is quoted: *""I'm probably a woman. I don't know if I could ever really say that I  was a girl – I was kind of a boy for a long time. I don't know, who  knows? It changes.""*

And like... that was striking to me. I don't think I've ever been a woman. I've definitely been a girl. I'm happy being a lady. I'm feminine. But I'd almost rather be called a man, not because I really resonate with ""man"" that much, but because I just don't get ""woman"".

1180,aae8lr,2018-12-28,genderqueer,I think I'm a transmasculine non-binary woman?,"Does anyone else here relate to this? I'm female assigned at birth; never felt weird being called a ""she"" or a ""girl"" (I'm sure it helped that my parents let me follow my own interests as a child, many of which would probably be considered more ""masculine""). I did freak out when I hit puberty and started growing breasts, though; I felt so uncomfortable about it and about having to start wearing bras, but I just assumed that was normal.

I'm fortunate that I must have a lot of androgens, or something, because as I've continued to grow into adulthood (I'm 28) I've found that I'm a lot more comfortable with how my body has developed. My breasts are small - barely an A cup - so I almost never wear a bra unless I'm working out; then I wear a sports bra which I'm a lot more comfortable with anyway. I can wear a T-shirt and a men's button-down (my preferred look) and my chest is barely noticeable. The proportions of my body are more like a small (5'4"") man than a woman - relatively broad shoulders, long torso, square hips, a subtle but visible Adam's apple (yes, some women do have these). I also have a lot of leg hair and a bit of a happy trail that's been slowly filling in over the last few years.

I wear almost exclusively men's clothing, and I feel happiest and most confident when I have a short men's haircut - a fact I discovered only 6 or 7 months ago when I specifically asked for my hair to be cut in a men's style rather than simply saying I wanted my hair cut short and showing my hairdresser pictures of what I had in mind. Even though all my photo references were men, he had been ""adapting"" them slightly to feminize them which isn't what I wanted. He was totally happy to cut my hair in a men's style when I brought it up, but somehow hadn't realized that was what I had wanted before.

I don't feel like I need to have top surgery or take T to be comfortable in my body, though I do wish I could grow a beard because I LOVE the aesthetic (really, what I want is that stubble look - mmm). I have ample peach fuzz, but it's largely invisible, and the faintest trace of a mustache. For the past few months I've been taking biotin for hair, skin and nail health, and I've noticed just a couple of darker hairs starting to pop up and my sideburn peach fuzz feels thicker recently, too. My lovely, supportive wife got me an electric razor and some beard balm for Christmas, which is awesome because a) some of my peach fuzz is long enough that I can trim it down with the 3mm setting and it feels like gentle stubble, and b) the beard balm seems to enhance that effect, as well as making the hairs just the tiniest bit more prominent. I told her I've started to cultivate an ""invisi-beard."" We also just started taking magnesium glycinate because like many Americans, we are both magnesium deficient. I didn't learn this until after I started taking it, but it also helps with hair health and growth, so I have my fingers crossed that maybe I'll continue to see some small changes.

I don't really mind that I won't grow a full beard because I do also like the way I look without facial hair, but I would like to make my peach fuzz fuller and thicker as much as I can. (It would never be worth it for me to go on T just to get facial hair, particularly because I love my full, thick head of hair and male-pattern baldness is strong in my family.) In private I sometimes like to put on fake facial hair, and this past Halloween I discovered the ""apply fiber mascara to your peach fuzz"" stubble look and I fell in love with the idea that I can ""enhance"" my existing facial hair to create stubble that is actually ""mine"". This was my Halloween look:

[For those of you wondering, yes, I am dressed as Captain Hook from Once Upon A Time. My wife went as Emma Swan.](https://preview.redd.it/sm92xy20t2721.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de61112b777fe285a95ca403e43901bab704da10)

I haven't done a full face of stubble again since Halloween, but I have improved on my technique:

[Wearing my Hook costume again because it makes me feel suave as hell.](https://preview.redd.it/35lnzz8qt2721.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dcc3f3dbee8328a45b44a281ec8e8bd6ccfa5067)

[A better view of how this look appears up close. No Hook costume this time, lol.](https://preview.redd.it/b2m7q19qt2721.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a644b3795655f8866a0c921309b30a58bb8ec617)

But even with all of this, my identity as a woman - or at least, someone with a ""female"" body - is important to me. I've found that as I've become more comfortable with expressing my masculinity and with the idea that, hey, I might want to start presenting to the world at large with mascara-enhanced facial hair sometimes, I've also become more and more certain that I want to continue to use ""she/her"" pronouns. In a sense, I think this is because I feel like a man and a woman, or a ""female who happens to also be male"" -- and with my presentation already skewed heavily masculine, I guess it my pronouns are the space in which I want my femaleness to be acknowledged.

Unlike other transmasculine individuals I have seen speak out, the label ""lesbian"" doesn't feel wrong or weird to me - in fact, I strongly identify with it, which is probably also part of why I still prefer ""she"". My wife has been very supportive of my gender exploration and in fact, says she knew I was non-binary long before I did (which makes sense, given that she's been calling me her ""wifesband"" since our newlywed days). She is bisexual but homo-romantic, so she says that I'm the best of both worlds because she sort of gets both in one person.

Although I prefer ""she"", I don't mind when strangers call me ""he"" or ""sir"" and generally don't correct them. It can be fun to be read as a he! It can also be stressful though, like when every airport employee going through security called me ""sir"" and then on my way to the airport women's room I suddenly thought, ""Shit, so many people are reading me ""male"" today; what if I run into trouble in the restroom?"" (I like both ""she"" and ""he"" more than ""they"", but ""she"" feels more right despite how I want to present myself.)

I suspect that if I do go out into the world with my mascara facial hair, people will either see me as a cis male, or read me as an FTM person who is transitioning. There are of course some women who grow facial hair and choose to let it grow (i.e. Harnaam Kaur), but they generally present feminine enough otherwise that they are still gendered as female.

If you've gotten this far, thanks for reading! I wanted to both put my voice out there as someone who identifies as transmasculine but wants to continue using female pronouns, as well as find out whether anyone else here feels similarly (or is maybe the opposite - transfeminine but wants to use male pronouns). It seems that most transmasculine individuals use ""he"" or ""they"", which has at times made me question whether one of those ""should"" be my preferred pronoun - but of course, no two non-binary / genderqueer individuals are the same and I get to choose my pronouns same as anyone else.",AFABtransmascwoman,t2_1fj4pkez,0.95,98,33

1185,j00hq7,2020-09-26,genderqueer,"Based purely on facts, which label do you think best describes me?","Hi all! So early this morning I came out to my girlfriend. I've been struggling with self-doubt about my gender for a long time, and I've finally decided that I'm somewhere in the non-binary spectrum, to put it loosely. The label that I've been using (though not to full satisfaction, based on indecision and uncertainty) is demigirl. However I'm not sure that's the ""correct"" term to use as far as definition goes, and I'd like some opinions on what suits the description of my gender best.

To be as short and concise as possible ~~(spoiler: I wasn't, I'm sorry)~~, I am an AFAB person who identifies as a woman about 65% of the time, and non-binary for the other 35%. Of course that may not be an entirely perfect percentile range, but you get the idea. Basically I (usually) identify as a woman more often than I do non-binary. Which I feel applies to the ""demigirl"" label.

However, I don't feel these things at the same time, and I think that's what ""demigirl"" is trying to imply; that you feel like both at the same time, but... have a stronger connection/preference to being a woman? Please excuse me if I'm wrong, I am an absolute baby-queer when it comes to this stuff and I'm still trying to figure out my own feelings, let alone how to accurately describe and/or understand certain concepts/labels (I'm very open to learning though!!).

To me, it seems more like I might be ""genderfluid"" in that I don't really experience both at the same time--I still normally express myself androgynously while feeling a stronger connection to being a woman, but I don't see that as experiencing both feelings at the same time; that's more just an expression of who I am as a person. I've never been particularly feminine or masculine; I've ridden the middle line for most of my controllable (yay for LGBTphobic parents!) life. 

I have times where I love looking more feminine and being called a woman, using she/her pronouns, etc, and there's other times where I'm okay with she/her pronouns because that's what I'm used to, but I don't really identify or *want* to identify as a woman, among other things (which are still hard for me to explain right now; I've fought being nonbinary for a long time and have a long road ahead of me until I'm more comfortable and secure trying to ""explain"" that part of me, especially since it's still largely misunderstood by me; thankfully I don't have to ""justify"" myself here).

I've also heard mentions of a label called ""bigender"" that sounds kind of similar to me, but I don't know a lot about that one yet, honestly. One of my biggest hang-ups about not using ""bigender"" (if it's even applicable) or ""genderfluid"" is because it seems like there's a lot of bias that it's mostly used by people who feel both male and female, and I'm *definitely* not male. That I know for certain, and I *never* want to be taken that way. Are they still ""usable"" for people who identify as nonbinary and woman?

Any opinions, advice, resources, etc, are all extremely welcome. And if there's need for more information to base opinions on labels, I'm more than happy to provide! Thank you all! <3",Ratlochet_1472,t2_4jzx17k1,1.0,2,3
1186,1a0806,2013-03-10,genderqueer,Haircuts. FUCK!,"**TL;DR:** Skip to ""So today,""

So. I live in a fairly small, fairly conservative town. I came here to go to community college for cheap, after living in a larger, more liberal city.

I think in the city, my dysphoria wasn't as apparent, because I could present myself any way I wanted without being ostracized. Now, however, the restrictive ideals of the small town I'm is has forced me to either conform to their ideals about gender, or be treated like I'm less than human. At first I conformed, I'm not even sure I was aware I was doing it.

Over time gender conforming felt more and more like a prison, until I finally broke down and decided my mind was absolutely-for-sure not female. I still don't really know what my ideal gender is, but for now calling myself genderqueer and going back to looking more decidedly androgynous has helped. There's still the problem of how people here see me.

In the city I felt that people, if the judged me at all, did so based on how I chose to present myself. Here, however, it feels like everybody's view of everybody else is colored by what gender they're perceived to be. There are very strong stereotypes here about the differences between males and females, men and women. I've found that it only gets worse if you try to present as something outside the gender binary. I've noticed a gradual increase in disapproval from my bosses at work, though my co-workers and friends have been great.

**So today,** I went into a local Great Clips to try to get a kind-of androgynous, punk-ish haircut, and I'm sitting there, trying to explain what I want, and the lady that's going to cut my hair has to call this other girl over, and they're still not getting it, and finally the kinda get it, and one of them says ""that's too complicated"" and the other one agrees and I'm thinking ""What the fuck? I thought you were supposed to know how to cut hair! I could get this exact thing so easily in Portland!"".

Anyway, they decide that they can't even try the haircut I want (I probably should have left at this point) and offer to get me some of their hair-styles books, and ask if I want women's or men's. I don't want either, but I say mens, and of course ALL of the hairstyles are significantly shorter than I want, except for maybe a handful that are longer than I want. I really don't know why I stayed at this point, or why I picked the one I did, but by the time I got home all of this frustration just turned into a huge crying fit, and a vow to never get my hair cut in this stupid little town.

**TL;DR:** Small-town hairstylists have no idea how to do hairstyles outside the gender binary. I weep.",Perceptual_Existence,t2_676s3,0.8,14,25

I don't regret starting hormones for a second, my mental state is infinity better and I much prefer all the features I've gotten to how it was before I started transitioning, and if anything I still want more. I've come to the realizing that while I don't necessarily regret transitioning, I regret how I transitioned.

I've always noticed there was this weird disconnect between myself and transgender people, especially transgender women. I always dismissed this as internalized transphobia, and then simply the fact I don't have a lot of common with the majority of transgender women (I meet zero in-group stereotypes.) Eventually, it grew to the point where I stopped calling myself transgender again. While I do think there is a bit of internalized transphobia and cringe, like what Contrapoints talks about in her most recent video, I can't help if I wonder if my therapist and I were onto something several years ago...

I almost transitioned when I was 23, but even though I technically meet the criteria for gender dysphoria, I was so comfortable, confident, and authentic living as a guy that even my gender therapist doubted if I was really trans or maybe was nonbinary. What I mean by that is that I was much less gender nonconforming as a guy than I am now, and was 100% perfectly okay with that. I think there was really was at least some of my masculinity which was authentic. It was less ""I'm not my real or authentic self, but I'm not my whole or complete self."" To this day, I feel the same about who I am now versus before.

For about two years there, I called myself that though I no desire to ever come out because I didn't see the point since I wasn't going to transition. Honestly, I was fairly content with that I identity, I didn't know if I was bigender (what my first therapist said) or gender fluid (my dysphoria came in waves I learned and gender fluid actually fluctuate and I never once felt dysphoric from femininity or being female. Plus, my identity has always felt stable and it was the dysphoria that got worse or better). I called myself a ""guy with gender dysphoria"" and was quite okay with that term.

Then there's also about that time from about 4/5 months into transitioning until about a year into it when I started going full time. I didn't necessarily feel more myself during this time, but I didn't really care if I got misgendered. I told myself ""Well, I'm rather androgynous right now and can't really blame."" Well, over time I started to care because I was sort of, indirectly told, to start caring because it's not okay to misgender trans people. Ultimately, this really only got worse after I started going full time because I was intentionally presenting as a woman instead of what I told myself before of ""presenting as myself and I'm gendered, however."" August 2018 comes around and it's time to start school again (I'm a teacher) and I wasn't ready to come out at school and was so worried it was going to be awful to wear my men's work clothes and be called Mr and all this other stuff. But it wasn't. If anything, it was awkward until I at least came out to my colleagues. My principal offered me to also transition at work, but I wasn't ready and didn't want to add that onto my students' already tumultuous start to their 9th-grade year. I spent most of that first semester part-time, and slowly went full time at work, coming out to my students that November.

Honestly, full time has been stressful. I'm constantly worried about how well I pass, suddenly hate being gendered male, and something doesn't feel right thinking of myself as a transgender woman. I feel more like I'm putting myself into a box than I was before I started transition. I've been exploring the idea of maybe taking on a more gender neutral, but maybe femme-leaning name like Kendall or Morgan. Ultimately, I don't really want to be seen as anything in the middle, but either/or.

I don't want to take up space in all women's events if it hurts others.  I do not want to be oppressive.

In the big real cis world I totally pass and can get by in bathrooms or whatever.  But in the queer community I get called a lesbian or lady or woman every time I go to a gay male space.  I am not welcome there either.  In the queer community I am not welcome in womens spaces or mens spaces, and I would really like to have the opportunity to explore both of these spaces and see what feels comfortable

Like in men's spaces I just feel unsafe. People stare and call me names. In women's spaces people remind me about trans misogyny and stuff.... Fuck... Are any of you going through this? Do you think I am missing the point somehow?

TLDR: I don't want to be oppressive by attending women's only events, but I really do want to explore my gender and femininity in this way.",deathbylife,t2_4voss,0.84,26,9

1195,2hr7fu,2014-09-29,genderqueer,Question about gender stereotypes and their relationship to gender-nonconforming identities (x-post /r/askGSM),"Hello everybody,

I grew up in the gay community (my parents are gay) and identify as pansexual myself. I have a question about the relationship between identifying as gender nonconforming and gender stereotypes.

How I understand the presentation of gender nonconformity is mixing things that are stereotypically male or female (eg, a dress with a beard) or presenting as ambiguous by being careful not to lean one stereotypical way or the other. If I am incorrect in my understanding of this (and I realize there is a spectrum and some may do things differently, or some may dress a certain way one day and another the next) please feel free to correct me.

I also understand though, that presentation and identity are very different. Theoretically, then, if there were no gender stereotypes, would this change the way gender non-conforming people identify, in the sense that sometimes they love their boobs (or lack thereof) and other times that doesn't feel right? Am I understanding this correctly? Also, how do you think this might change gender non-conforming presentation?

As a side note, isn't it just fun to play with and mix the stereotypes sometimes? If I could grow a beard I feel like I would have a huge one - and then wear lipstick everyday.

If I am completely missing the mark, please correct me. I am genuinely interested in how people feel about these things and how they think they interact.",vevevoutique,t2_iltmo,0.67,2,1
1196,13jcbl4,2023-05-16,genderqueer,Starting to identify as Gender Queer,"Hey Everyone,

I'm new to this sub but I have been on various other LGBT and queer subs for a little bit now. In recent years I've done a lot of soul-searching and introspection regarding my gender and sexual identity and I just want to see if there is anyone else who has had a similar experience as me or if perhaps there are different terms I could use to better describe how I'm feeling.

I am AMAB and use to consider myself straight. I've never felt dysphoric. I've never felt like my identity was lacking or missing. But I'm pretty sure I've had a lot of internalized biases and societal norms that directed me towards certain identities.

I'm in my early 30s and my wife and I have been married for nearly 9 years. She has been openly bisexual since before we got married and it was through talking with her that my eyes were opened to queer identities. Not long after I began to identity as pansexual. Through my conversations with my wife, I realized there were a lot of nuances to my sexual identity and ""straight"" just did not fit. Realizing this, I felt like a part of me expanded and became something new. A part of me I never really felt was lacking but now that I had it, it felt amazing and euphoric

Time goes on, and I begin to question my gender identity. Again, I consider myself male, but I began to realize that the western societal expectations and gender roles, and what not of men just seemed to not fit me. I consider myself a guy that likes to express himself in ways that western society would say is only allowed for girls. Again, if it wasn't for the supportive openness of my wife, I don't think I would have ever considered any of this. But as my eyes have begun to open once again, I am feeling that same euphoric empowerment of just feeling more ""me."" I'm still parsing out my gender identity but at this point, I think western society's definition of manhood is way to restrictive so I consider myself gender queer.

I know my experiences are nothing compared to some of the bigoted anti-trans and anti-queer stuff others have dealt with. And I really want to do whatever I can to help promote safe-spaces for other queer folks. I think every person has a right to define and express themselves in their own terms and I'll fight anyone who tries to take that away from others, but I also realize my story is different from most of the ones I see online.

So I just wanted to ask. Has anyone else had a similar experience as me?",Zen_Astro,t2_kjw17hj4,1.0,13,4

1200,juimeq,2020-11-15,genderqueer,I'm so confused about my gender,"Hey, I really need to vent, because I'm so confused and I have no one to discuss it with. Ever since I was a kid, I never felt the need to label myself. I am privileged to come from a family that is tolerant of different sexualities and I never even questioned my bisexuality or felt that there's something wrong with me because of it. Only recently I have realized that not everyone feels attraction regardless of gender. I was so clueless and I genuinely thought that at some point people just choose. My parents never pressured me to do traditionally feminine things (I'm AFAB) and I was free to do whatever I want (although they gave me a feminine name and used she/her pronouns). The stereotypes weren't reinforced and I only have a vague idea of what femininity and masculinity means. I have never felt a strong connection to any of those. I feel like I am just a human being who happened to be born with a uterus and breasts.

I know that I am female, but I might be out of touch with my femininity. I wonder if people fit into the gender binary feel a strong connection to their gender, or if it's something almost meaningless for them like it is for me?

This is one side, but on the other, I like wearing clothes that are designed for women - that's how I feel the most attractive. Hence, I feel like an imposter in this subreddit who just likes the idea of being non-binary due to the internalized misogyny and not liking the gender binary. Also, I'm in a relationship with a straight man and I am afraid to bring this up in front of him because this could mean that he isn't 'straight' anymore? Although I'm still a femme... and he's really open and tolerant. Would it make him not straight anymore? If he'd still claim that he's straight, I feel like this would undermine my gender identity, as I don't want to be perceived as a woman? I don't want to lose him over this. I don't know how to talk to him about my gender.",peachy-angel,t2_1z5zyb1e,1.0,7,4

1203,3cv9ix,2015-07-11,genderqueer,Should I base my gender identity on my personality or how i feel my body should be?,"Hi r/genderqueer! Im a 16 year old trans girl*, but im still having a lot of daily confusion about my gender identity. I decided I was trans a little over a year ago, but things havent been any clearer for me. 

I feel like I *want* to be female, and when I see people say things like ""Im ok being treated and referred to as female"" i get a feeling like its something i want/should have. I dont have any kind of phantom genitals, and i dont mind mine as long as literally nobody but me knows they exist, but otherwise im like, 100% i want/should have a female body with female secondary sex characteristics. I want people to see me as female. And that sounds simple enough?? But its not. 

Internally, I misgender myself a lot, like echoing in my head whenever i gender myself correctly. I have constant obsessive thoughts (literally probably equivalent to pure-obsessional intrusive thoughts), like ""the thing you just said/did is something a boy would say/do so youre really a boy!"" and a constant fear that nobody *really* sees me as female, and that im a fraud whos ""pretending to be a girl"" even though all i want IS to just *be* a girl. I guess i also have a lot of masculine personality traits... i intentionally developed them as a child because i thought I had to and it seriously disgusts me. My inner voice is also masculine and it feels so invalidating. Most of my interactions because its summer have been with my family who thinks im a boy and refers to me and treats me as one, so could that impact on my self image?

-

Basically, Maybe my personality might be appropriate for a boy but i REALLY REALLY dont want to be a boy. I just ""feel like a boy maybe"" and it takes a LOT of self talk before i can start to feel like a girl. 

So I guess what im asking is, how much should I pay attention to those things when considering my true gender identity? Can I change those things about myself (and how?) and will I still be authentic (real) and valid? Would those things make me not female (at least partially), and should I consider identifying differently, like maybe bigender? 

Thank You!!

1204,u2bpcb,2022-04-13,genderqueer,Questioning gender & would love some advice,"So I’ve been wondering about my gender a lot lately and it’s come to my attention that that’s something cis people typically don’t do. But I have no idea what I am and I would really love some advice. I’m sorry this is long. 

I’m afab late 20s. I guess the root of the problem is I have masculine tendencies but I don’t know how deep they run? Like in my ideal world I would dress masculine—I’ve always loved male clothes and fashion more. Dresses and more feminine clothes make me uncomfortable almost all the time but sometimes I don’t mind them. 

Okay but also I know clothes don’t define gender. When I was a little kid way before I really had a concept of trans or anything I used to tell people that I was born a boy but my parents wanted a girl so they made me one. Whenever I would play pretend games I made my character a boy with a boy name. I grew up with lots of boy cousins and always wanted to dress like them and be a boy. I remember crying when I first started getting boobs because it meant I wouldn’t be flat chested any more. 

But as I got older idk if I just thought that was shameful or childish or what but I stopped all that and embraced being a girl more I guess? I really leaned into sisterhood and I’ve got a great group of women in my life. I identify with a lot of the struggles or challenges women face and I feel like that aspect of my life along with sisterhood is a core part of me. Sometimes I feel like I identify more with being part of a sisterhood than with actually being female. I’m not sure if that makes sense. But at the same time being called a woman just feels wrong. Whenever I call myself a woman I always stumble over it because it just doesn’t fit right. I don’t mind girl or female though? Man doesn’t really feel right either though. 

But even now the version of me I see in my head looks more masculine & I have a very older brotherly vibe to myself. At the same time I want desperately to be a mom one day.

Some days I wish I could wake up with short hair and a flat chest/no curves and look like a man. Some days I love my long hair and feminine curves. In an ideal world I think I would love to be able to shape shift and choose what I look like based on the day. Ironically, ever since I was a child I always said shapeshifting was my dream superpower. 

I’m also afraid that if I’m not really a cis female, have I deceived my way into these circles of women? Are people going to see me as a wolf in sheep’s clothing trying to infiltrate the sisterhood somehow? I don’t know how I could cope with that. 

I really don’t know. I would love if anyone had some thoughts or feedback or ideas or ways to help me work through this. Therapy isn’t really an option right now due to cost and an extremely conservative family. If you’ve read through this whole mess and have any advice or thoughts or ideas I’m open to hearing them. I wish someone could just do a scan of my brain and tell me what I really am lol. 

Please be kind, I’ve put off posting this for probably a week now because I’m afraid of what people might say and that it might be hard to swallow. Thank you.",xyzlghjk,t2_3vjt9sah,0.96,46,22
1205,o1z89r,2021-06-17,genderqueer,Help define me!,"So AFAB and happy to identify myself with she/her.
Dress varies wildly from day to day. 
In serious relationship with a man.
Am a mother and happy to be seen as one 
Enjoy sex but rarely have the urge (or time, amiright??)

Definitely label myself as some kind of demi - as a teen I struggled to find common interests with other girls and this included finding random people or celebrities attractive.  
I could look at someone and be like oh they have really nice eyes or cool, that's a sweet hair cut.. but I could never find anyone attractive enough to be a romantic interest unless I really got to know them as a person. 

Have never been the stereotypical girl, gossip bores me, I can't do my hair or nails to save my life and shopping is a chore. Love monster trucks, comics, wrestling and games. Generally feel more comfortable with male friends but want to be with female friends. I just struggle to identify and gel with them. I feel so fake! 

I used to pretend one of Thomas the Tank's friends was female just so I had someone to identify with (this was when the biggest female characters were the carriages). To date I've never really been attracted to another woman but I prefer the female form to that of men. As in 9/10 times when drawing or picking a video game character, I'd go female. 

As a child I was petrified of being associated with manly things - probably because I was a bit stocky (used to obsess about my shadow looking like a dude's) and was often compared to my seemingly perfect sister. 
After being assaulted in my teens, I realise now that I set out to make myself look more unattractive (such as gaining weight and wearing baggy clothes)

So, questions for the new to this me: 

1) would I be demisexual, and what's the difference between that and demigender?



2) can someone extremely dumb down the term demigirl?? To my mind it sounds like someone who is/associates as female but not enough to... ""grow up"" into a woman?? I know that can't be the right definition. It would fit me to a t if it is though, i definitely feel like I fail at adulthood most days!!



3) am I overthinking this?? Genuine question! I vehemently reject gender stereotypes and I'm concerned that if I start rejecting being a woman because I'm ""not like other girls "" then I'm actually a problem and someone who contributes to negative/cliche female stereotypes

1207,5weu9j,2017-02-27,genderqueer,"Non-Visual / Internal / ""Deep"" Aspects of Gender","I was at a local LGBTQ+ group tonight and we did an exercise where we gave people compliments that were not based on appearance or anything outwardly visible, and it got me thinking about gender.

And I was thinking about my experience with gender, and how so much of my experience of gender is internal, abstract, and lies in the realm of ideas.

This was especially true when I was younger; when I was a kid and a teenager I lived mostly in the world of ideas and had little focus on my body.  As an adult I now focus on my body a bit more, but I find it's still not where the bulk of my experience of gender lies.

When I think about my experience of gender here are some of the things that come to mind:

* feeling discomfort whenever people are separated into gender and i'm forced into one group (usually boys), like I didn't belong in the group, didn't want to be there, and didn't like the idea of separating people to begin with.
* empathizing really strongly with people who are subjected to sexism and/or constrained because of their gender or when people make false assumptions about them on the basis of their gender (whether it was girls or boys). feeling a sort of fierce loyalty to people in this situation, and great distrust or discomfort when groups of males or groups of females band together ""against"" someone of the opposite gender, often wanting to protect the person being attacked.
* reading articles about ""how women think"" or ""how women cope with stress"" and thinking ""this sounds like it is describing me"" and then reading ""how men do such-and-such thing"" or ""what men want"" and thinking: ""I don't relate to this at all"", yet not feeling like i was a woman.  specific examples for me include holistic thinking, thinking more about social relationships, a desire for cooperation, a communication style full of sharing and affirmation and devoid of ""one-upsmanship"", or being more desiring of intimacy than sex in relationships.
* always wanting to transcend gender, like wanting to synthesize what I saw as the best of femininity and masculinity and distance myself from what I saw as negatives of each.  especially wanting to experience and understand things outside my experience to whatever degree possible, like how the female body worked (for example i've spent more hours listening to women talk about their periods, out of fascination, than any guy I've ever met, it's like something I love hearing about because it makes me feel more connected to the experience of women)
* often having an affinity for people whose personalities seem somehow gender deviant or gender-free, like girls who were tomboys, or who liked science, math, computers, or playing with bugs and dirt, or whose communication style was assertive and direct, and connecting more with boys who were more interested in social relationships, and who had more warm, mellow, and sweet personalities and were less aggressive or rambunctious, were good listeners.
* feeling discomfort with hyper-masculine or hyper-feminine presentation or personalities and gravitating away from those people.
* feeling discomfort with the assumptions that people bring, associated with them gendering me male (or rarely, female)
* seeing how people treat women and men differently socially, and sometimes wanting to be treated in ""the other"" way

Interestingly, a lot of the people that I feel like I've connected to on the deepest levels, with respect to aspects of gender, don't always have outwardly ""nonbinary"" presentation.  These can include nonbinary people who present in stereotypically masculine or feminine ways (which may match or be opposite to their assigned birth sex), and also cis people who look ""typical"" for their gender, but cross a lot of gender roles in personality or behaviors or ways of thinking.  I find these people help me to feel more comfy with myself and I like being around them.

I wanted to share these things because I wanted to help people to think about the deeper aspects of gender that aren't always immediately visible.

I sometimes feel very frustrated with how so much of the discussion of nonbinary people and trans people focuses on appearance and the body, whereas for me it's like really about personality and ways of thinking and social interactions and things like that.  It's super abstract and intangible but like really important to me.  I also sometimes get frustrated with the emphasis on identity.  For me, the people who really *get* my gender the most, have been cis people, probably mainly because they're my closest friends and they just happen to be cis.  The whole ""cis/trans"" divide has really frustrated me much in the same way the whole female/male divide frustrated me too.  So it's like, nonbinary identity is great for helping me make sense of my experience, but when it becomes an ""us vs. them"" like against cis people or against binary trans people, I get profoundly uncomfortable and I'm like...but...the whole reason I feel nonbinary to begin with is that I hate rigid categories!

I don't know, is this making any sense?

I'd love to hear from people if any of this resonates with you, and also, if you have your own ""internal"", ""invisible"", or ""deep"" experiences of gender that are really important to your identity or the way you experience or live out gender.",cazort2,t2_4gpcz,0.98,28,8

TW: religious abuse, internalized misogyny, internalized homophobia, internalized transphobia, closeting, depression","Hello\~ I'm new here, and I've been questioning my gender identity for over a decade. I'm afab and grew up religious to some extent for most of my life; before I embraced my queerness, I went through a very troubling religious chapter of my life where I had a lot of internalized homophobia, misogyny, and transphobia. The latter wasn't fully realized until after I left my religion, and even then, it took a while to understand. I still am.

My problem is this: when I was religious, I struggled and suffered so much with a deep truth that I could never be enough as a ""woman."" I felt like some kind of humanoid trying to be a woman, an evil creature fitting into a box that just wasn't meant for me. I felt like I was destined for hell because my womanhood was constantly in question, was debilitated by my queerness, and I was just one wrong choice away from everyone finding me out. I was never at peace.

It was a very painful existence; after I left it all, I wondered if maybe my struggling was because, well... maybe I wasn't a woman. What a concept! I leaned into gender neutrality, but this transition proved much harder for those around me who acted like I was asking too much from them. I felt defeated, misunderstood, embarrassed, and gaslighted myself back into the closet. That was a decade ago.

Now I am in a much happier place with my identity, at least sexually - on the basis of gender, those closest to me watch me shy away from the possibility that I perhaps am not entirely comfortable with the concept of being seen as a woman. My friends have been wonderful in knowing that I'd probably feel better with them using they/them pronouns towards me, but I hesitate and get scared. I don't want to go through any of it again. And now I'm faced with my internalized gaslighting, and it's cruel: what if I'm not genderqueer, and instead my religious past just caused self-hatred towards my gender identity? If I am a woman, that's fine with me - if anything, perhaps a genderqueer woman. I'm just lost. I just want to know myself entirely, after everything that's happened in my life.

I'm seeing a therapist who's having a dialogue with me about this, so I'm not walking this journey alone. I'm also grateful to find this space. Does anyone else relate?",coa7587,t2_b9jwq3iu,1.0,21,3

Hey fellow genderqueer humans! So I am AMAB, but since a young age have not felt particularly attached to that gender. I have always been more emotionally in touch than boys are expected to be, and in some ways stereotypically ""feminine"" but in a more tom-boyish way, if that makes sense? I am also bi/pan and when I was younger assumed that this less-masculine leaning nature was connected to my sexuality (now totally aware that is not true). Until recently I would just identify as ""male-by-default"" or, more jokingly ""gender apathetic."" But of late I've been doing a lot more soul-searching on this topic and have begun to realize that I in fact belong in the androgynous/non-binary category. Although I was already leaning towards this assumption, I decided to see if the internet, in all it's infinite and terrifying glory, had any sorts of ""tests"" available that could shed light on my gender identity in a relatively objective manner. I found several, ranging from silly, buzz-feed style ""What Hogwarts House do you belong in?"" to what appear to be more serious psychological evaluations.

So my question is: At least for the more ""serious"" gender identity evaluations out there, do you think there is merit to such tests? Has anyone else taken these and were you surprised/skeptical/offended by the results or questions? I found some of the questions to be a bit odd, many seemed to suggest that one binary gender or the other was better at different intellectual subjects (i.e language arts versus math), and several just pertained to stereotypical gender-role interests (power tools and cars for men, clothing and sewing for women). I was identified as androgynous or non-binary in all that I took, though many of the questions were very similar across tests, and I wonder if it wasn't just my pre-existing assumptions that influenced these results. As someone trained in a ""hard"" science I tend to take psychology with a grain of salt. I'm not saying it isn't a valid and useful line of research, just that every field of study has it's limitations and potential biases. Anyway, thoughts, opinions on these tests?

But it's confusing to me. Genuinely not trying to be an asshole and if this is innapropriate to post or it's in the wrong place please remove! 


So basically my friend who is the greatest badass person of all time and is just genuinely super amazing and whom I don't know what I'd do without. 

Told me they are 'gender fluid'. Now this seemed like a real big thing to say and I was so happy they felt they could tell me! I was so supportive and listened and honestly told a slight lie about how I understood (which in the sense that I understood their feelings just not the actual concept) cause I did ask them this but even after a few different ways of explaining. I still don't get it. 

 I want to be 100% supportive and obvs it wouldn't change anything in our friendship. You do you- is our life motto basically. 

But I am very confused. 

I understand queer, different sexualities (I'm asexual) and I understand trans as best as a non trans woman can. But gender fluid is something I just can't quite ... Get? 

The way my friend explains- some days they 'feel' more feminine and dress that way and other days it's more masculine. They don't feel like they are one gender. 

Which just confused me more tbh.

From my perspective.

I'm a woman. I 100% know that and am happy with that. 

I'm not 'traditionally feminine'. I wear docs, I hate skirts. I don't wear makeup and I've had both long and short hair styles. 

On the whole I'm not 'feminine'. Yet I know I am still a woman and wouldn't want to change that.

So I really don't get gender fluid.

My friend (and from other people online) say it's about 'feeling' like a gender and clothes can be a big part of expressing that...  but gender isn't about your clothes or 'stereotypes'?... Does my wearing doc boots and jeans make me a guy? Then there's people who say 'don't be stereotypical'

 And if people 'felt' like a man or woman wouldn't that make you trans? 

If you were a guy wanting to wear traditional 'female' clothes like dresses/or females wearing traditional 'male' clothes like tuxedos wouldn't that just make people 'crossdressers' in a formal sense of the word. Like I've been to weddings in pant suits before and no one has 'misgendered me'.  

I painted a girls nails in an after-school club for her and a boy wanted his done- he loved them, but he still knew he was a boy and said so to his mum when she picked him up lol...  

So yeah basically gender fluid is confusing to me and as said, this isn't going to change a friendship. I just want to try and be a good friend and educate myself.

1211,78vvm7,2017-10-26,genderqueer,Genderqueer and Feminism - Does rejecting feminine pronouns/etc. mean we've given in to our patriarchal society?,"Hey friends.

I recently came out to my parents as genderqueer/nonbinary/exploring my gender identity.  I felt I wanted to let them know I had started this process so it's less of a shock if I need to make medical changes to myself in the future.  My mom was pretty accepting and started using gender neutral pronouns with me and corrected herself for misgendering me ^.^ (I use they/them pronouns).  My dad just said I had a limited view of what a woman was (I'm biologically female) and needed to expand that view.  He works in the STEM fields and sees all kinds of women breaking stereotypes everyday and he's proud of me for graduating with a STEM degree and starting grad school.  While I understand his point, I still can't shake this internal knowledge that I am not female and that that identity makes me feel uncomfortable about my body and my socialization.  I identify as more masculine than feminine in most areas of my life.  But I also can't shake his words and as a former very vocal feminist I feel as if I'm abandoning a movement that I needed in order to pursue STEM fields and find my happiness as a statistician.  However, as said feminist what I could never except was the feminine parts of my body that caused a lot of trauma in puberty.  I don't want to abandon empowering marginalized communities and it's left me feeling very confused about the concept of rejecting female pronouns and rejecting that identity.

1212,jjibzu,2020-10-28,genderqueer,Trans and Genderqueer,"Hi!  

So terms have me confused.  They always have.  I’m 41.  Recently I have come to understand I am intersex (aromatase condition as well as a genetic abnormality which did not have its associated effect of xy sex reversal).  In addition I am a retransitioner (MtFtMtF).

So here’s the thing...I have always wanted to be a woman/female.  But I’ve also in the same breath identified personality wise with men (INTJ type is the rarest among females).  I’m sexually and emotionally attracted to feminine energy...so I’m a amab lesbian.  So because I’m what would be considered masculine for a woman recently for the past year or so I’ve started to refer to myself as a tomboy...a trans female tomboy.  But the tomboy label only half applies ..

But I’m also a bit more feminine..I mean I like to play with my hair and practice my makeup skills; paint my nails. Girly girl stuff side by side with my bluntness, assertiveness and directness and fearlessness and strength..and just do it attitude.

I don’t fit in the stereotypical places for gender but I feel like I fit in as I would normally had I been born female and just had some masculine traits and hung out with the guys while still saving a good chunk
of my femininity.  Another thing...I need to transition..my dysphoria isn’t overwhelming but it’s there and I can’t live the rest of my life as a guy.

I also don’t want body hair, face hair.  Want breast.  Want bottom surgery but I’m married so thats difficult.   I have a fear of being stuck in-between between male and female. 

I’d prefer she/her but I don’t pass (fully) now and pronouns don’t really matter to me.  Being considerate and respect do.

What exactly are my terms; I can’t figure out a term to describe me; I am really from before all these new terms but I fear they don’t fit me or are too broad where I am lumped with something I’m not.

Does girlygirl tomboy transgender intersex lesbian woman sound confusing to a listener? 

Am I gender queer or non binary or just trans only.  Should the masculine/feminine personality type be separated from the gender identity?  

I really want to understand these new terms like genderqueer and non-binary as they relate to myself and my trans female identity.

Are they seperate, can they be used together, is one exclusionary to the other, and is there still a term that works?",kalani96746,t2_5fppwezq,1.0,10,9

I've been playing around with she/they pronouns and am into the labels demigender and genderqueer. Although part of me is connected to being a woman, since it was how I was socialized, and I also feel connected in terms of struggle with misogyny and patriarchy, it doesn't always feel right and I don't like being perceived as a woman by people who aren't women or nonbinary. I recently told a few close friends and I'm feeling big impostor syndrome, worried I did the wrong thing by telling people in case I'm making it up to be trendy since I never had a significant amount of dysphoria. I know a lot of people find nonbinary genders hard to wrap their heads around and the thought of having to explain myself already makes me feel invalidated because I don't have the dysphoria that a lot of people are able to understand in some capacity.

I had thought about being nonbinary before coming out, since a part of me always felt slightly disconnected from femininity, but I always pushed the thoughts away because I thought since I didn't have dysphoria it wasn't real. Since coming out, the thoughts have become a lot more prominent. I've never felt like a man but I feel somewhere between female and not female, but not entirely both.

I’ve struggled my entire life with severe dysphoria, but outside of expressing concerns about my body I’ve kept extremely closeted about it. I’m married to a cis woman who I’ve known since high school. I’ve expressed some things openly like “I wish I was born a woman”, “life would be so much easier as a woman”, and I try to incorporate things in my life that make me happy like wearing minimal woman clothing (hoodies and cut shirts). I’ve spent my whole life sickened at the thought of living up to my assigned gender role. I’m a veteran and spent 4 years in the marine corps with a combat deployment to iraq. I’ve always given everything I’ve had but never felt like I fit in with the guys. I don’t want to be a protector, to be strong, or fight. I used to be someone from a traditional household that didn’t understand the community. I thought everything was just a choice and what I was experiencing was just normal, but I was wrong. In recent years since leaving the military I reflected on my childhood experiences, developed more with my expression having more freedom, and searched hard for labels that fit how I was feeling. I wanted somewhere to feel safe even if it was in secret. I ultimately decided I was genderfluid as I don’t currently feel like one gender. I’m constantly haven’t feelings of changing on the day. Mostly like 60% female, 20% neither, and the rest male if I averaged how I felt together (speaking about gender). Idk if I’m actually trans or non-binary. I have no issues with my genitalia, just my gender so I would never wish to have an operation. I don’t think I could ever pass. 

Now for the reason for this post. I accidentally told my wife in an argument I had over not wanting to have sex very frequently as to me “having problems with my identity”. Now she is bothering me when I’m not ready to talk about it. She says she’s “scared of what it means” and thinks she has a right to know. I’m scared, confused, and not ready to come out.

(confused about my own gender, background inside)","**Do any of you feel much more closely connected to one binary gender than the other but still feel it's not a great fit to identify with that binary gender?**

_________________

I'm AFAB and identify mostly as a woman (socially), but I don't fit the (stereotypical) gender role of women perfectly so I feel like I don't fit the label ""woman"" perfectly.  Basically, even though I pretty much identify as a woman, I *also* think that gender roles are inherently limiting and kind of stupid because of that - if that makes any sense...  I also often wish I had a more androgynous body - or that I could easily switch between masculine, feminine, and androgynous looks and be gendered accordingly.

Could that mean that I am genderqueer?  Or am I just a confused, weird ciswoman and I shouldn't appropriate the term?


_________________

[As a background to my gender:  When I was young (maybe 7-13), I dressed like a tomboy, wore my brother's hand-me-down clothes, and often wished I were a boy (but not to a point of being miserable with myself or my own body).  In high school, I started to dress feminine out of social pressure and didn't mind it, but I was not super feminine.  Now, post-college, I dress both masculine and feminine.  I feel physically comfortable and cool in masculine clothes that fit me well, and I feel sometimes sexy but sometimes awkward in feminine clothes that fit me well.  

Socially, I am a lot more (stereotypically) feminine - I squee at baby animals, I relate better to women, I enjoy romantic comedies, I am empathetic and emotional, etc.  I'm not entirely stereotypically feminine, though:  I like video games, I like adrenaline sports, I am not interested in fashion or makeup, I can be very strong willed, etc..  But I'm definitely not (stereotypically) masculine either - like *at all* - I'm not athletic, I'm not aggressive or confident, Im not that into cars or sports or science, I have a very low libido, I am more socially anxious around men, etc.  

Physically, I'm really drawn to (both attracted to and wish I could better portray) androgyny.  I wish I had  both a female-bodied and a male-bodied version of myself that I could switch between whenever I wanted, and I wish that I was gendered as a woman in my female body and as a man in my male body.  More realistically, I think I'd like to be perceived in public as a guy sometimes, a woman sometimes, and an androgynous person who can't be gendered sometimes.  I don't have gender dysphoria that makes me miserable, but sometimes I wish I had a flat chest instead of breasts, sometimes I wish I had a slightly more androgynous face, and sometimes I wish I had no genitals... (I hate having a vagina not because it's a female part but because not being able to see what's going on in there terrifies me)].

Sucks I've to preface with this: I'm fully supportive of whatever anyone chooses to do with their life/however they identify. If you/they are happy, I am so very happy for you. If anything I've written here offends you or your identity, I apologize. I'm simply trying to educate myself.

This spawns from the ""controversial"" joke Colin Jost made on SNL last weekend about transgender identities (link at bottom). I'd be happy to discuss the joke, but I'm more interested in discussing Tinder's new identity options specifically.

I was surprised to hear the number 37, and to learn that there are a number of additional identities beyond these. Seemed like a lot. So I did some reading.

Androgyne and androgynous. Androgyne is ""A person who *fits both physical characteristics* or feels like they are both a male and female."" So, even if they identify as male, but fit both physical characteristics, they could be considered androgyne? Meanwhile, androgynous is ""the combination of masculine and feminine characteristics."" They seem to be saying the same thing, and neither seem to be an identity, more of a physical description.

Gender nonconforming is ""people who do not follow other’s ideas or stereotypes about how they should look or act based on the female or male sex they were assigned at birth."" I don't understand how this is a gender identity. A male who is fine with acting in a manner generally considered by society to be feminine, or vice versa, is a gender identity? Don't you first have to identify as male or female, by definition, to fit this description? 

Genderqueer or non-binary. This one I fully understand..but it seems like it covers SO many bases. How can there be 50+ identities if one of them is basically ""does not give a fuck what other people think about gender identities."" I understand this is a very important one so please, inform me.

Two-spirit. ?? I don't understand this at all. I don't understand what it means or how it has anything to do with gender identity. Seems like any identity could describe themselves as two-spirit.

And on and on. To be clear, again, I'm not attacking anyone or calling this stupid, it just seems a lot of these identities are redundant or not gender identities at all but more behaviors/preferences/attitudes. I mean, is anyone here identifying as ""pangender""? Meaning, every single gender identity that exists, they associate with??

**Backstory**

I don't currently identify as anything but I also don't know what I am.  I'm AMAB and I get a ton of gender envy when it comes to women, when I see someone interesting and attractive I both want to go out with that person and **be** that person at the same time.  I love female fashion and style as well.

If you gave me the magic button test ""push this button, become a women zero complications no cost"" I'd do it in a heartbeat.  However in reality I don't think my quality of life going through with all of that,and being broke and not fully accepted, would be better than what it is now so here I am stuck in limbo.

Either way I don't think this is something I'm ever going to figure out, and it's likely just something I'm going to have to live with.

**Current Quantifiable Problem**

I'm getting my life back on track.  I've gotten a 1/2 decent job, working for someone who isn't an asshole, I'm losing weight and I've got my own place.  I want to turn over a new leaf in my life and start doing things because **I** want to do them, not because someone else expects or wants me to.

[I have quite long hair](https://imgur.com/a/2BlR1ET), it's down to about chest length and it does give me a bit of gender euphorbia sometimes.  I'll get compliments on it like once every few months and those always make my day/week/month/year.  However I haven't had it cut in like 7 years and I really want to start changing things up.  I get a lot of social anxiety so I do a lot of googling/research before I do anything so I managed to find a hair salon in my local area that does cuts based off of length, not gender.  I got an appointment booked in like 2 weeks with a stylist that is non-binary.

Currently leaning towards getting a long-shag style cut, with the possibility of playing around with highlights/coloured highlights in the future, but I'm not sure yet.

How am I supposed to tell the stylist that I'm interested in getting a long cut, in what's traditionally a ""feminine"" style and I don't care that it's a traditionally feminine hairstyle, and that I'm looking for more androgynous/feminine leaning suggestions?  Like you'd think it would be easy based off of the place/person I'm going to but I've got a traditionally male name and, besides having long hair, I present as a traditionally male person.  I'm not concerned what looks good on me ""as a guy,"" I want what looks good on me ""as a person.""

I've practiced some of the stuff I was bad at and let go of some internalized misogyny, and I now rotate between super feminine and utilitarian badass. I love my body but really, really hate periods.

I definitely don't want to be perceived as masculine in any way. It's more that I feel like gender norms are dumb and we shouldn't have to deal with them.

Since a month (after I finally become aware of the terms and their meanings of ""trans"", ""non binary"", etc) I'm questioning obsessively, reading and researching every day online and borrowing physical books, if I am a trans woman/girl (AMAB).

I am aware that the only person who can know it is me and eventually my therapist (actually I don't have one and planning it for a probable HRT process); but I still ask you.

Answering to the ""Button quiz"" (if, by pressing it, I'll turn with a woman body and fully accepted) I'll say yes because I want to try being a woman viewing if it can identify with the image I have of myself. In fact lately, after learning the meaning of dysphoria, I feel disappointed comparing my actual face on the mirror and the ideal version (that I don't know but definitely it isn't masculine). I hate wide thighs, muscles, belly, hair, ambiguous voice and the structure of my face

I shaved for trying that sensation and I love it [I really don't know how I could live until know with a hairy body].
I hate when people refer me with ""he/him/sir"" pronouns because it give me the sense of being strictly put in a stereotypical field, and using ""she/her"" give me euphoria (also when 2 of my friends refer me with feminine pronouns after I asked them) and a little sense of strangeness because I suppose is all new for me. For my language is more complicated, in fact in Italian is literally impossible to translate ""I'm tired"" giving the initial sense of gender neutrality, it'll be translated with ""Io sono stanca"" for 'female' or ""Io sono stanco"" for 'male'.

If you would ask me *why I want to be a woman* I'll answer in 2 parts. 1° I don't know, 2° I perceive women to be freer by their wonderful dresses, public emotions and their beauty.
Linked with it, always when I seen a woman (doesn't matter if 169% super model or not) I am envious and jealous mentally saying ""damn it, I wish I could be like you"" or ""oh, you don't know how much like you are being a woman"".
Recently, after some advice from forum, I cross dressed with high heels, skirt, bra and dresses; and OMG I felt sooo cute [ erection included ;) ]. I'm not sure but the bra (too bulky for me by my mum) gave me a sense of completeness like for a pirate to find a treasure.
I decided to grow my hair for viewing how I feel.
I did a tons of online quiz (I know that it is not a relevant clinical help) and when I had the trans woman/demigirl I was in peace. At the other face of the coin when I scored ""non trans"" I felt disappointed like an imposter and losing so much hopes and mental energy for a delusion.

I am sure I don't want to be a man (the toxic version) and, for now, I don't desire a bottom surgery ( too pain and I like my penis; meanwhile the top surgery feels interesting.

As a small child, I was pretty stereotypically feminine, then in the years leading up to puberty I was pretty tomboy-ish. The way puberty changed my body made me really uncomfortable and I often wished I could go back to the way it was before. I guess I implicitly attributed this to like kate moss era beauty ideals though, not to gender identity?

Then recently I’ve had a couple (very harmless) interactions where I felt like the fact that I’m a woman was being emphasized and they made me feel uncomfortable and alienated. Since I’ve been wanting to check out the concept of gender-queerness more in-depth for years now (I’ve felt like it was on the back of my mind but not urgent), reflecting on those feelings led me here :)

Like I’ve often felt being perceived as a woman is keeping people from seeing the real me. I definitely don’t wish I were perceived as a man though. 

Right now I am kind of questioning: do I get this icky feeling
because I’m uncomfortable being identified as a woman, or do I just feel uncomfortable being sexualized? (because being perceived as a woman so often means being implicitly sexualized.) Maybe the situations made me uncomfortable because I felt I was being reduced to my gender and not being seen as a whole person?

I have recently been far more outwardly expressive of the genderqueerness I've felt since somewhere around puberty (before that I never really thought about it too actively, and was outwardly a girl that wore a lot of baggy sweatshirts/jeans/monochrome sneakers), and have been actively considering the complexities of desire/attraction more. I was wondering if anyone could comment on whatever it is that I'm experiencing:

(Also, sorry if I'm using any terminology incorrectly--I'm still trying to figure out how to talk about gender without sounding like an ass and am frequently confused about terms)

A bit of history: I had only identified as bisexual since late middle school until recently just going for [gender]queer.  I also recently realized that I lost my virginity to a woman (the co-captain of my HS varsity wrestling team--she was quite androgynous and muscular as hell), as my hymen didn't rip and in cis/hetero terms PIV sex + tearing is a standard definition. I was in general attracted to men and women, though almost exclusively androgynous women. I confused myself in college and afterwards by dating lots of super femme women, and wondered why the spark frequently wasn't there, though some I dated a bit longer including a queer couple. (the gender of same-sex dates is also a new revelation). The rest of my dates and partners have been cis men, but usually on the less butch side of things--long hair, smooth, pale skin, lanky, or if more stereotypically male-bodied, very comfortable in a dress or just more androgynous personalities. I am not attracted to manly man personalities and do not suffer bros.  

That being said, much of my attraction to men as an adult has stemmed from the perspective of gay male attraction--the books I read in HS and later including porn and a TON of Jean Genet, who is the ultimate, in my opinion, in describing gay attraction. I love the gay leather scene, the concept of rough trade, Tom of Finland, wrestling, jock straps, etc. and consider this type of attraction separate from the perspective of cis female attraction to men. Part of me also retains the latter perspective. On the other hand, the kinds of women I'm attracted to as a woman are different than the kinds of women I'm attracted to when I envision myself as a cis male. ON TOP of all the binary stuff, I'm also just into humans that are a mixture of everything or something entirely different, *especially* if they've got a mix of expression going on to satisfy more of the things that make me tick. 

So the question being, does anyone else feel like they experience a range of gender-gender attraction? What does it mean to you?

When I was very very young, I didn't know about gender, really. I was born, raised, and socialized male, but my best friend up until around the time of puberty was a female. This was literally never a point of contention and it was never something that I thought of as weird. It wasn't even a matter of looks - we were basically twins in appearance, and had similar hairstyles. People regularly confused us. 

About the time I hit puberty, I was fully aware of gender and sex and all of that. This was about the time I really fully appreciated all of the norms associated with gender.

But there was a problem with me.

One of these norms for men was that platonic relationships with women wasn't really permissible. It's understood that men are always seeking sex, no matter what, and that anything that appears to be friendship is just a really elaborate ploy *for* sex.

And whenever this stereotype came up, I always thought of my best friend (who sadly moved away by this point).

At no point was she a girl or a woman or female to me. She was just my friend. She liked the same dumb jokes I did. She liked to ride dirt bikes like I did. She liked to make jokes about me being dead when we went down to CVS and I'd put my arm in the blood pressure/heart rate monitoring machine and it'd recognize me as having a flat pulse and no blood pressure (because I used it incorrectly). 

She wasn't her gender. She was a person.

Something was wrong. Something didn't feel right. 

This was cognitive dissonance. 

On one hand, I paint all of my nails.

On the other, I leave them plain.


A little bit later, I started to get into writing. But I had other interests - namely programming and music. Something that was fascinating to me early on was how differently I was perceived in different internet circles related to these. In programming circles I was immediately and irrevocably understood to be male. In music, it was a toss up - until people knew I played guitar. Then, male. In writing - writing was interesting. People who only knew my writing assumed I was female. 

Something was wrong here.

How could the same person, acting in the same way, come across as either male or female depending on the context?

I never corrected anyone when they assumed my gender.

I just got comfortable code switching between conversations where I was assumed to be male and where I was assumed to be female. 

Something didn't feel right.

I shouldn't be able to do this.

This was cognitive dissonance.

On one hand, I paint all of my nails.

On the other, I leave them plain.


Around mid-late high school, I recognized I was attracted to ""both"" genders. I do not ever remember a point where I wasn't, and I always assumed growing up that everyone was like this. I dated both men and women. I never connected with either straight or queer communities. Consistently, both my straight and gay partners tried to downplay the side of me that was inconvenient to them. They were aghast at the idea of being attracted to both and insisted that it was a phase, a stepping stone, denial on my behalf (instead of theirs).

I accepted I was not like either group, and stayed away from identifying with either. Past the erasure of my identity, I was tremendously privileged and didn't have any issues dating who I wanted to. I never had to ""come out"". It just was.

But there was a problem.

In their unguarded, quiet moments, when only I was around, and we were both vulnerable, I didn't notice a difference between how men behaved and women behaved. We all had the same kinds of insecurities. We all had the same kinds of shit to do. We all had our (unique) challenges and benefits. I dated some men who were very emotional. I dated some men who never even frowned or smiled. I dated some women who loved fashion. I dated some women who just wore what was comfortable, and didn't understand what the big deal was. 

I couldn't use gender to reliably stereotype any individual. 

Something didn't feel right.

It should have been different.

All of the men I dated should have been flamboyant queens or stone-cold stoics. There is no in between. 

All of the women I dated should have been fragile and emotional. What are tomboys? 

This was cognitive dissonance.

On one hand, I paint all of my nails.

On the other, I leave them plain.


By college, I entered in what I can only describe as my ""anarchism"" phase. I had come to the conclusion that gender was entirely bullshit and useless. The erasure of my bi identity had left me feeling similarly about orientations - useless bullshit. I presented as I did and acted as I did to make everyone else around me happy. I escaped into writing and reading frequently, where there was no limit on who I was.

I wasn't happy.

This was about the first time I met a trans person. 

Someone who is desperately cognizant of the gender binary, but is placed on the wrong end. 

I didn't accept the disphoria these people had. Gender is bullshit. Get over yourself. We all are uncomfortable with these stereotypes. You aren't special. 

Then that person committed suicide. 

I never directly said those things that I thought, but.

I could have.

That hasn't ever left me.

This binary was so important to them that not fitting on it correctly was cause for them to end their life.

Gender can't be both bullshit and so valuable.

This was cognitive dissonance.

On one hand, I paint all of my nails.

On the other, I leave them plain.


When I started to work (I dropped out of college *to* work, one of many privileges of working in programming) I was full of dissonance. In my own experience, gender had been nothing but a confining box that told me how I should behave, invalidated my emotional complexity, and told me that half of my friendships were fake. But everyone else around me, online and off, found so much comfort in it. 

I finally connected with queer spaces, and met more trans people (and even one intersex). I found people who were (finally) willing to accept that bi is a thing.

My positions became less extreme.

Gender isn't bullshit.

It's just constructed. 

It's constructed like everything else in society.

But.

Like everything else in society, we use these norms for identity and shorthand. 

I had been so used to erasure and finding conflict in identities that I never fully appreciated this. 

When I talk to lesbians, they are so incredibly happy and proud of being a lesbian. When they talk with other lesbians, they immediately have something in common. There are entire communities built on nothing but this. This identity. 

This so far as I can tell is true for all of our social constructs. Gender, orientation, whatever. They're all constructed, but they're not bullshit. They're useful. Comforting. They give people a short hand for describing who they are and what they do (and sometimes, who they do). 

Gender isn't bullshit.

It's useful. Just it wasn't, to me.

This was cognitive dissonance.

On one hand, I paint all of my nails.

On the other, I leave them plain.


After working for a few years, I decided, on a whim, to buy some women's clothes. I think maybe for Halloween. The why doesn't really matter anymore.

Whatever remaining biotruthy bullshit ideas I had floating around in my head about gender and sex were routinely and roundly smashed. 

At this point, I couldn't even really believe there was that huge a physical difference in bodies in the sexes. Obviously there's *some*, but it feels like these differences are severely over-stated. The clothes fit me fine. Women's bodies aren't magical. Men's bodies aren't magical. These are threads of fabric we've put together in a certain way. They aren't magical. They will fit you fine if you have the right size.

The intersex person in my life further confounded any biotruthy bullshit. They were AMAB but androgen insensitive. In other words, they had a penis, but were really absurdly feminine. Supposedly genitals and hormones are destiny, but this truly is the most damning to this essentialism. They started taking estrogen and ""passed"" as a woman effortlessly. Her body was never male, not really. It was just missing some of the hormones it always needed. 

Gender doesn't determine genitals. Genitals don't determine hormones. Hormones can be changed.

No part of this essentialism works.


I wore women's clothes more often.

I was always jealous that there was so much more variety.

I wore it mixed with men's clothes, though. 

Men's clothes are warmer and have pockets.

I like being warm and having pockets.

I started to wear makeup.

I didn't do it to look like a woman.

I did it to make other people uncomfortable.

I wanted them, everyone, to understand this weird dissonance. To experience it first hand. I wanted to look as androgynous as possible, and challenge everyone's expectations of how I would act.

But I was above this shit. Some powder on my face wasn't going to impact me.


So, I didn't expect that I would one day look in the mirror and see a woman looking back at me. 

I didn't expect to even further see that woman after the powder was gone.

I didn't expect to see either a man or a woman in the mirror based on, so far as I can tell, fucking nothing, but a whim.

Here I am, having spent all of this time coming to the conclusion that gender was irrelevant to me, and I can't even escape it privately. 

It's so ingrained. 

On one hand, I paint all of my nails.

On the other, I leave them plain.

I do it because I can look down and see one hand as female, and the other as male. I can put them both side by side and cognitively understand that I am projecting gender onto something that doesn't even fucking make sense since it's the same goddamn hands except for a little bit of paint. 

But I project anyway, and I can't stop my mind from doing it. 

Maybe some day I'll stop projecting.

I'm not holding my breath, though.

1234,173bgnf,2023-10-09,genderqueer,A little help with my gender?,"So, I have a little conumdrum understanding labels just in order to express to others, especially considering healthcare. This is the only reason I feel I need to go down the rabbit hole on this subject, though I don't usually really care.

I'll be reading people's accounts in here to see how people feel :) Maybe that helps. But I wanted some help understanding a few things.

So it appears that depending on language, territory and even from group to group, definitions and expectations change. And when I find something that makes sense in place A doesn't in place B. So I feel I ""challenge"" expectations of the LGBTQ+ community even more than the heteronormative community. That's what frustrates me the most.

I'll try to make it short.

I present myself at most places as the gender assigned at birth, like work and family, that is, cis. But I love being treated as the opposite gender, and even being ""confused"" when I am with that expression. I express the opposite gender when I'm more comfortable and feel happier and more creative.

Being in my assigned birth expression doesn't bother me, but having a trans expression makes me happier. But also, I don't feel like anything in the spectrum, I mostly feel either male or female, with all stereotypes it can entail. That doesn't mean I'm 100% cis or trans at any, as I believe not even cis males or cis females are 100% cis. I can be a little tomboyish for example.

So what I been reading as genderfluid and bigender feels most right to me. I've always understood me as trans, but people have been questioning me... a LOT. And those are people in healthcare. I understand, they wanna make sure I am sure. But at the same time, as part of the LGBTQ+ community, they are the ones kinda ""Judging"" me being trans and insisting I'm non-binary (I have been in the past but I just felt it wasn't for me, I like the ""extremes"", let's say).

My frustration is mostly because now I gotta explain myself to the LGBTQ+ community? This is so strange to me. I hate expectations of others on me, and that doesn't only come from heteronormative society...

If it wasn't for the long-term vision of these pioneers, our community would probably remain decades behind in progress.

* **Lee G. Brewster**, a gay drag queen and crossdresser, was a civil rights activist and   lobbyist, and founded the nation's earliest transgender advocacy   organization, Queens Liberation Front, in 1970.
* **Sylvia Rivera**, an agender sex worker and civil rights activist, founded the second   transgender advocacy organization, STAR, and hosted a communal shelter   for NYC's homeless street queens.
* **Marsha P. Johnson**, a gay drag queen, sex worker, and a civil rights activist, was   co-founder of the second transgender advocacy organization, Street   Transvestite Action Revolutionaries in 1971.
* **Leslie Feinberg**, a butch lesbian, was author of ""Transgender Liberation"", that became a   rallying call for the creation of a ""transgender rights movement"" and   directly inspired the ""LGBT"" initialism.
* **Holly Boswell**, a nonbinary civil rights activist, designed the transgender symbol in   1993 and proposed ""transgender"" as an umbrella term encompassing the   whole spectrum of gender diversity.
* **Riki Anne Wilchins**, a neutrois feminist and gender theorist, conducted the first U.S.   survey of anti-transgender bias in 1995 and coined the term   ""GenderQueer"" to describe gender-political dissidence.
* **Judith Butler**, a lesbian feminist theorist, was author of ""Gender Trouble"" the   groundbreaking book that served as the cornerstone to queer theory and   is still essential reading in gender studies courses.

Whenever someone insists that genderqueer, nonbinary, or gender nonconforming people don't belong in queer spaces or claims that it was only trans women that created the transgender rights movement, be sure to share this list with them.

Now, I didn't have much time to think about that, because I was in an abusive household and was priotitizing survival instead, so accompanied by ADHD I forgot about those feelings. 

But now recently (in the past years worth of time) those feelings have come up again. Im getting major envy from trans women and I dress half the time like a femboy, but also I'm completely fine and happy with my penis and like doing stereotypical dude stuff. 

I feel like having boobs is appealling to me in the sense that I like the shapes they lend to the body and (Im very bad at expressing emotions) it seems like it would be damn cool to have them. I'm definitely gonna try out bras and some padding to see how I feel, but yeah hope this doesnt sound weird.

Also I use any pronouns and other than the boobs am completely fine in a male body. Im pretty sure im genderfluid if thats the right term.

1238,ysqkn1,2022-11-12,genderqueer,Does fancying someone make your dysphoria go haywire?,"I enjoy musing over gender although I practically never get a chance to discuss it myself for fear of giving the game away. This particular subject has probably impacted my life quite significantly, for the most part by stymieing me and others. And I bring it up here because I've never been lucky enough to passively observe others discussing it.

&#x200B;

I'm 31 and consider myself genderqueer, not in the closet so much as being crushed underneath it. I came to terms with it around this time last year, told one (1) friend who I knew would be good about it, and haven't really done anything about it since. I'm not sure what to do about it and who it would ever be worth telling. But I don't exactly want to stay still, grow old and die either.

&#x200B;

Here we go then. I've never really been in a relationship, and that's partially because I can't be honest with myself and the other party. When I'm taken by someone my dysphoria either goes into overdrive, or lessens to the point that I find myself denying that it could have ever been a problem.

&#x200B;

In sexual preference, I am a pretty red-meat male. My interest is almost definitely female, and definitely femme. I can appreciate how that means I am almost certainly perpetrating misogyny and that my gender identity doesn't absolve any of this. (Please address it with me when and where I exhibit this misogyny on this difficult subject.) I can also appreciate how a woman or femme who would like me back, would almost definitely be expecting a male, a man, and some masculine performance. I further appreciate the irony between a life of paralysing gender confusion in myself, and my awe towards feminine behaviour, dress, shape and scent. Sorry for how disgusting that sounds, but I struggle to phrase it in both an honest and decent way.

&#x200B;

However I feel that with every crush I've had, there's an intractable side where I desire to be more like that person in some way. Not to *fully be* them, but to partially embody who they are. This is mostly impersonal: I simply want to be effeminate like them; some of their specific traits I may fancy for myself as I see them right in front of me, but on the whole it is their feminine brilliance that puts me at a loss. It leaves me pretty anguished to see myself writing that out, as I imagine it's a perspective could lead to abusive behaviour if left unchecked. On that note I have spent my adulthood quietly addressing behaviour of mine that may be creepy and removing that side of myself. Where somebody is being mistreated for being a woman or femme, they could very well be me in a life where I'm more open. Therefore their cause is mine.

&#x200B;

That disruptive aspect to it is what makes this such a difficult confession, and one I feel I'd never be able to admit to a love interest. And because of that, there is a barrier that's almost always present when I'm wishing to be romantic. In doing so they will see more of me, and I can choose either to put on a front indefinitely, or to reveal that I don't perceive myself fully as a man, which not only can hurt, disturb or amuse them but also exposes the most vulnerable, weaponisable thing about me. As a result it seems to be safer to never get involved in the first place, and spend my life sighing in the distance. An arrangement where I'm viewed as entirely man and expected to be a man feels like it would be a half-death to me.

&#x200B;

The other side? As mentioned, if things seem to be advancing and it seems I'm being perceived fully as a man and liked for being such, my dysphoria can go away and I can feel more inclined to flirt and pursue someone (not like it's ever worked too well!). Having said that, since I came to terms with being genderqueer, I've felt this way quite solidly with only varying intensity in how keenly I don't feel like a man.

&#x200B;

I spent last night with a few female friends and acquaintances who are such nourishing company that it took a long time to part ways despite how tired I was. In their ranks is a woman I find incredibly beautiful, with an assuring presence and the kind of energy and positivity she can pull from nowhere that I always clamour for. We're rather different, but I am with virtually everyone. I mention to you that she changed out of her skirt before kicking back with us at the end of the day because she joked when I got a bit of food on my jeans that I could go home in her skirt instead, to which I replied that I'd do the wriggle of shame if it came to that, all pretty throwaway in free-flowing conversation, but it felt like such a provocation! The kind of thing I'd go along with if nobody saw anything more in it than I saw in it! Would I even be able to guess if she meant anything of it - can she read that she likes me? Can she read into any of the unfulfillment I live with by presenting men's characteristics with a man's appearance in the most vaguely effeminate way I can feel I can get away with in my small-town, male-dominated world? If so, can she somehow juggle these seemingly contradictory perceptions?

&#x200B;

Anyway, it pretty much tees up my brain to run through these questions again. Why does my wish to be more feminine follow suit with the intensity of my crushing? Should this make me as ashamed as I am? When most men are around women they seem to reassert their masculinity. When I'm around women I try to relate to them by leaning in. When I do so a lot of pressure releases from within, and is replaced by pressure to not overdo it or to be harmful.

&#x200B;

1239,a889n5,2018-12-21,genderqueer,What does this mean in terms of gender?,"So growing up, I never really felt like a ""boy"", and when puberty hit, the feelings got worse. Even though I didn't grow much facial hair and despite having had breast growth (even though I was relatively skinny), I hated my body and knew sometime in college that I was trans. I thought that because I was amab, that this meant that I had to transition to female. I was privileged to have access to hormones and therapy, but now that I'm nearly 2 and a half years into transition I can't ignore the fact that I hate stereotypically ""womanly"" self presentation. I would really stress out about makeup, even though I was good at it. I also hated heels, dresses, and even long hair (but kept it long because I was afraid of being visibly trans). I would normally wear sweaters and jean, and I was lucky that I passed really well as a cis woman, but that's just it, I don't feel like a woman at all. But I feel right in this new body, I'm okay with my breasts and I want to have bottom and facial feminization surgeries in the future. Yet, all I want to do is cut my hair short, and wear sports bras and baggy clothes.

I don't know how to make sense of any of this. I was born with a male body, but want my body to be normatively female, but also want my presentation to be masculine? I don't see myself as any gender, but does my desire to have a female body mean I am trans? Or because I want to present as masculine, would I be cheapening the term because I am AMAB? I have considered that I might be a butch woman - but the woman part makes this designation not fit either. Is it possible to be dysphoric and trans when it comes to sex (or sexual characteristics about the body) and not about gender? Furthermore, am I transfeminine because of my desire to have a female body, or transmasculine because of my desire to appear masculine? I don't think this is due to internalized homophobia or some sexualized fetishization of female bodies either because I'm definitely asexual and aromantic too.

1241,hyhhcp,2020-07-27,genderqueer,AFAB and questioning my identity while isolated during a pandemic,"Hello friends, I just needed a space to express my complicated feelings about my gender. With so much time isolated in quarantine these past few months, I've noticed a lot of what used to be 'background noise' when it comes to my gender identity coming to the forefront in a way that's become more difficult to ignore. I'm both excited and terrified because I'm 31 and in a very healthy long-term relationship with a cisman that I love very much who describes himself as 'mostly straight', and there is a lot I love about how I've developed my life and the wonderful friends and family I have around me. I feel like coming out about my complicated gender feelings would make my life even better and strengthen my relationships, but there is definitely a lot of fear about people, especially my partner, not taking it as well as I think or asking questions I don't have the answers to yet. Luckily, my partner has a circle of close cismale friends, including several who are gay and bi, one who is questioning his gender himself, and another who is dating a transman, so I think there is openness there that I might not give him enough credit for. He probably won't even be very surprised, but I hope he will still love me and find me attractive.

Anyway, my complicated gender feelings are that I love my body and take a lot of pride in being a woman, but I'm not very feminine and cringe more and more that I am called 'Ms.' and 'Ma'am' at work as a martial arts teacher for kids and adults. I'm a high level athlete, and my whole professional life is martial arts, and part of what has felt at home to me there is embracing my masculine side and getting to spend all day in 'neutral' clothes like martial arts uniforms and workout gear. My gender expression has shifted over the past few years to have more masculine elements at times, and I've had a buzz cut for 3 years that instantly made me feel more at home in myself, and I stopped shaving my legs and armpits. I've questioned my sexuality and casually dated women as well as a transman, but I'm mostly straight and am physically attracted to cismen. I spent many years trying to 'play up' my femininity in order to get guys to date me. Although my current partner started dating me after I had made some of these more masculine changes to my presentation, he does respond very positively when I 'play dress up' and wear more feminine clothes for formal events or in the bedroom. Dressing up femme is fun for me sometimes, and sometimes I do feel sexy, but it mostly feels performative like I'm in drag. He also likes it when I'm more dominant, so maybe he is fluid like me in that way too.

I think what I want is to feel accepted in choosing to keep experimenting with masculinity and for this facet of fluidity or queerness to be acknowledged more publicly. I recently ordered my first binder, which should be coming tomorrow, and I want to talk to my partner before he sees me wear it. I want to be called 'Coach' rather than 'Ms.' I still want to be a woman, but that's not all I am -- I want to expand the definition. I'm sure I'm not the only one here to feel this way.

My interests are rather female, I don't really like man's man stuff like beer drinking and watching football shudder I rather watch TV shows directed at a female audience and hang around with the girls. As a child I played with barbies and dolls but also with legos, roboters, cars, action figures etc.

In my mind I have made up this alter ego that is this super strong, gorgeous woman, that looks like me just female. I think about her almost everyday and live out fantasies in this parallel world that I created. Often, I wish I could be her so badly. Wear these beautiful dresses that I imagine, wear high heels and have long luscious wavy hair and wear make up. Not like a drag queen, but actually become female.

I desire to be her but not to the point that I would actually feel in the wrong body and desperately want to physically transition. That would kinda go to far, considering I don't reject my male body like a trans woman does but I kinda do feel like a woman and a gay man at the same time?

If I woke up tomorrow as a woman that would be fine, but being a gay man is fine with me, too. I kinda wish I could be both and magically morph into a man or a woman whenever I want :(

I'm so confused, what does this make me? And how do I deal with my desire to be partly female? Help!",neuronihilist,t2_6pjxsjt,0.9,14,4

I’ve struggled in the past posting about this, so please be kind; I don’t want to be misunderstood. Obligatory “Not All AMABs!”

I have had several interactions over the past few years where amab non-binaries have used their male-presenting privilege to either belittle, interrupt, talk over or silence me. They get served first, even though I’d been waiting longer; they’ve used their size to stand over or intimidate me, etc.. This has from memory never been during discussions about gender; apart from with an ex where he would try to attach his experience of closeted, masculine (he/him) non-binary to my experience as an openly, transitioning (they/them) non-binary, which felt more like narcissistically trying to one-up me than actual invalidation. But he used a *lot* of instances of being Tall, well-known (small town, we’re in the music scene) Male-presenting authority to do shit I could never, usually calling in favours & people excusing a lot of bad behaviour cuz he’s just a Cool Guy. These other interactions usually happen the same way that cis straight men talk over/invalidate/insult/sexually manipulate me; so if you’re femme/a woman/afab, you probably know what I mean by this. 

I suppose my reason for posting is, is I also feel like I cop a lot of sexist discrimination & men hitting on, touching & acting inappropriately to me because of my *perceived* gender - & it hurts like a bitch because I really am trying to look more androgynous to avoid gender dysphoria & misgendering... but I continually come across amab non-binaries who seem happy to benefit from & use their male-passing privileges. Maybe my question is, *do you think amab non-binaries inherently hold more privilege because they were socialised & raised as boys?*

Big love to all the amab non-binary babes putting in the work at unlearning internalised toxic masculinity! PLEASE never feel like you’re taking up space in queer spaces, especially fucken “Women & Non-binary” events; we want to see you, we want to hear you.",dollydaze666,t2_5jup9acg,0.61,4,8

I know a lot of teenagers have a period where they are confused about their gender identity, but I don’t think this is that. For some context, I identify as a guy rn, but I have always hated using he/him pronouns to refer to myself, and I internally scream whenever someone calls me sir or man. 

For the longest time, I thought I might be a transgirl, seeing as I have nothing in common with most guys, I don’t like any stereotypical man things, and I have always been better friends with girls than I have with guys. However, I no longer feel any body dysphoria as in “I was born in the wrong body, I should be female”. I act feminine when I’m alone, and always much more confident when I’m in stereotypical women’s clothes, with makeup on, and a wig.

Could I be a transgirl in denial or am I a feminine-presenting enby? Because tbh, I find the idea of someone using they/them pronouns to refer to me a lot more comfortable than even she/her and definitely he/him",ThoughtParadox67,t2_4520v8rh,1.0,2,0

1250,eidciw,2020-01-01,genderqueer,I don't understand what genderqueer means exactly... but also I might be genderqueer.,"So, where to begin...? I'm 31, assigned male and birth and never really had a problem with it, and bisexual but didn't discover that until my 20s.

I guess I should start with not really understanding what genderqueer means. Like, I get on an intellectual level that gender is just a social construct, but does that mean that whether or not you're genderqueer just comes down to how much you live up to societal stereotypes about a specific gender? I've never liked the idea that a man is less manly because he cries at movies or likes to sew or a woman is less feminine because she likes cars or whatever. So maybe someone could help me wrap my head around the difference between a man with \*stereotypically\* feminine characteristics and someone who's gender queer...

As for myself, like I said, I've never had a problem with being assigned male, living as a male, being viewed as male, or anything like that. I did, however, mostly have girls for friends as a kid, until I hit puberty and started being attracted to them and got awkward (I'm bi, but mostly attracted to girls, and didn't figure that out until I was an adult anyway). I still make friends much easier with women, and definitely prefer the way I can be more emotionally open and vulnerable with women than I can ever be with men. I love sex, I wish I had more of it, but I never understood the singular drive that basically all of my male friends had to chase it when we were teenagers. I especially don't get it when my peers now act the same way. I love watching the UFC and training in various full-contact martial arts, but I've never understood why so many men are so quick to be so aggressive. [And I absolutely hate the ""Man Box""!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td1PbsV6B80) I've been thinking a lot about this for a little while now, and I kept finding new stereotypes like those that have just never quite fit me.

As far as physically, I've been pretty happy with my male body. I used to have a good bit of dysphoria over my body hair, and I've mostly gotten over that but I do still generally like to keep it to a minimum. I love my beard though! And I love my penis, lol! A few years ago though for Halloween, I went with my girlfriend (now ex) to a showing of Rocky Horror, so naturally I went in drag. I wore one of her dresses, some stockings, and she did my makeup. I was absolutely shocked and confused by how much I liked the way I looked, haha! And I didn't really put this together until I started doing some serious reflecting on this the last few days, but since then, I went over to a friends house for a game night, and she was showing everyone some of her pretty nice wigs. They thought it'd be funny if I put one on, so I did, and they took a picture. Now the part that just started to click with me very recently is how disappointed I was when I saw the picture. I have a pretty big beard (which, like I said, I usually love!) so I looked like a 70s folk singer. I was pretty disappointed that I didn't look cute and feminine.

I remember reading something a while ago written by a trans woman. She said her therapist asked her one day, ""If someone had a magic wand, and could make you wake up tomorrow as a woman, and everyone would know you as a woman and all that, would you take it?"" And I remember even then, but especially now, thinking I would love that opportunity, but only if I could switch back too. Like I said, I love a lot of stuff about being a man, but there's a lot a really don't like about it and a lot of stuff I'm envious of women for, but I always thought that was just normal. I've also really been wanting to try crossdressing again, but a mixture of anxiety and I guess apathy have been keeping me from it. I also just don't think I could ever shave off my beard though, lol. Like again, if I had a magic wand so I could lose the beard for a day to put on a dress and some makeup and some high heels and look sexy, but then the next day have it back so I could go back to looking like a lumberjack, that would make me soooo happy!

Sorry for being so long-winded, and if you've made it this far, thank you so much! Even if you don't have any advice or anything, I don't really have anyone to talk to in real life that I think would understand any of this, so it's nice to get it all out.

1253,4m3sst,2016-06-01,genderqueer,"Defending People Against Overgeralizations, and Gender Identity","One thing that bothers me a lot about gender and gender roles is overgeneralizations that people make, statements in which people make an untrue generalization, like: ""Women are so blah-blah-blah..."" or ""Men are so blah-blah-blah...""  I'm especially bothered by ones that include all-or-nothing or absolutistic language like *always*, *never*, ""all women/men..."" or the like.  Another thing I heard a lot growing up are statements about ""real men / real women...""

I think these statements are one of the ways in which gender norms are enforced.  I think the statements contribute to defining the cultural constructs of gender.  The statements can be a positively-worded statement that defines a traditional gender norm including both positive and negative statements like: ""Women are sensitive and sweet / moody and emotional."" or ""Men are strong and assertive / insensitive and pig-headed.""  I think these statements can often be at the heart of misogyny and sexism, as well as transmisogyny and the shaming of femininity.  I think they also manifest in man-bashing that I see among women (i.e. making sweeping dismissals of men, rather than raising specific concerns about specific behaviors), which I think can itself be a way of reinforcing transmisogyny and indirectly, misogyny (especially because when women rant negatively about men, it downplays or erases men or male-identified people who don't fit into whatever stereotypes were being thrown around).

I tend to feel a visceral dislike for these sorts of statements and I tend to identify strongly with people who object to them.  I think that because these statements are made both about women and about men, these statements have contributed to me identifying both with women and men, especially with people who resist these sorts of statements or characterizations.  So like, I identify with both women and men, in terms of both of these groups of people being groups that are sometimes negatively characterized (or forced into ""positive"" characterizations that don't fit them and that can be coercive when people don't fit them), and so I can empathize really easily and intensely with people who break these things, including people who still feel like cis women or cis men.  It's like, because I identify so strongly with these things, it makes me feel like my own identity is split between the true groups, and lies in a neutral ground, outside of the generalizations.

I think that these statements capture one of the key or deepest aspects of how I experience gender.  First, I don't feel like I fit the stereotypes.  I'm AMAB and it was pretty evident as a kid that I didn't fit the ones about boys well at all, nor did I want to grow up to fit the ones about men.  But I also found that my friends who were girls, as well as adult role models, both women and men, often broke a lot of these norms / generalizations too.

I'd be curious to hear if anyone else has experienced this.  Does this make sense?  I'd be curious if people who identify as genderqueer, nonbinary, and/or with other nonbinary identities, tend to object more strongly to generalizations about gender than is typical for people.",cazort2,t2_4gpcz,1.0,13,1

Since I can remember, gender roles and stereotypes have always seemed obtuse to me. Such harshly restricted rules with outlandish expectations and social implications. Growing up in a pretty heteronormative culture, I adhered to these expectations as a young child. Judged those who seemed ""other"" and had a complete lack of understanding of non-hetero sexuality or even the concept of gender as a whole. 

Around 8/9 I found myself particularly intrigued by boyish things. I wanted short hair, army print cargo shorts (i loved those), nothing pink, a boy's bike, and for people not to see me simply as ""a pretty shy little girl"". I wanted to be rough and tumble, strong and smart. I even tried to pee standing up for a while lmao. 

Through the development of my identity in my teens, I was well aware that I rejected gender stereotypes and expectations. I was (and generally still am) comfortable in my identity as a woman. I just detest the overwhelming and restricting binary that society entraps us in. Our restrictive language and severe lack of education. The absolute perfectionism chokehold media has on humans to the point where we've lost the meaning of beauty and authenticity. (I cant stand most social media platforms for this reason). the constant need to cover with makeup and make each strand of hair lay just so, and SHAVING don’t even get me started on body hair. I'm ranting now, but you can feel my frustration. the false perception of life through a phone screen, ya dig?

But more and more I feel that my general distaste for society's binary isn’t just about society, but that I don't ascribe to it. Obviously, fuck gender norms bc of all the aforementioned, I'm a human that has no need to fit anyone's expectation. But I have started to reflect inwardly. Is it just societal perceptions I am fighting? or my own concept of gender? I feel as if I can describe myself as a ""woman+???"" (was gendered ""girl???"" in the womb and thought it was still pretty accurate lol) I'm proud and confident in my body and such, but characteristically, I hardly feel womanly. I have feminine behaviors and intrests, but my attitudes feel genderless. I don’t fit into the (fake) boxes, which is fine. But why do I feel the need to box myself into something I don’t understand???

Lately I’ve been reading and watching some stuff about queer theory just from general interest, and it’s made me question a lot about how I perceive my own gender. In hindsight, I think I’ve been questioning my gender for a while now, for a number of reasons:  

* When I was younger I always knew I was different from other boys my age, and chalked this up to the fact that I was gay. But when I was at university I still felt like there was something internal or intrapsychic separating me from the other gay guys. 
* I have never been comfortable talking to my family about my identity as a gay man. My parents know, and they’re very liberal and accepting (or, well-meaning), but it still makes me uncomfortable bringing it up, like it’s an over-simplification. I haven’t told my extended family. I used to think I had some internal conflict over gay stereotypes, like I was scared they’d make incorrect or degrading assumptions about me based on my sexuality, but I think there’s more to it in a way I can’t really describe. 
* This is a difficult one to put into words, but I have never felt like gendered clothes of any kind really ‘express what I feel.’  I don’t think I’d be comfortable wearing ‘women’s clothes’ but I currently just wear variations of a very neutral ‘jeans and a plain t shirt’ style. It still feels like I’m trying to dress ‘as’ something else, but anything more overtly masculine or feminine also doesn’t feel like me. 

So my question is, given that I’ve reached a point of questioning my identity, what could be the best way of reaching an answer? I’m trying not to think in terms of “am I non-binary or am I cisgender,” because that’s another binary choice so maybe defeats the point, but I’d like to have a stronger grasp on how I ultimately identify.

I'm going to keep reading up on queer theory (I ordered a textbook online), and I think meditating might be useful? Also I've been going to therapy for about 3 weeks and I found out last week that my therapist is non-binary, but there are other things I need to address in therapy before I get to this so I think it'll be a while before I start to work on it with them.

1261,6r3m5k,2017-08-02,genderqueer,"Possibly genderfluid/non-binary, really confused and can't make my mind up about HRT and regret coming out","Hi all,
Sorry this is super long. Just reaching out to see if anyone has had a similar experience as me, as I feel I am going crazy atm. I am 29 years old, AMAB and started MtF HRT in 2015.

I guess when I first started exploring my gender identity around 25-26, I realised I had a lot of dysphoria around being male both socially and physically. At first I didn't even consider that I might be female, just not male in a traditional sense. I made changes to become more of a feminine/androgynous guy, sort of inspired by Bishounen anime character or the gender ambiguous Kpop/Jpop dudes in asian cultures. I wanted to look like a girl, almost to the stage of passing as one, be pretty and cute instead of handsome and masculine and be afforded alot of the social flexibilities that girls have over guys (around clothing etc.)

After making alot of non HRT changes (growing hair out, lasering facial hair, wearing makeup, dressing androgynously), people started to gender me as female on occasions. People referred to me as ""she"" or ""ladies"" when I was out with friends, held doors open for me etc. and tbh it made me feel really warm and fuzzy inside. I had started dating guys for the first time (I'm bi) and had my first boyfriend and when I was with him, I kind of felt like his girlfriend. He kind of picked up on it I think and he treated me like I was the female in the relationship (in a traditional gender role sense), he was really protective of me and it felt really nice :)

To the rest of the people in my life, my sort of gender ambiguity was seen as something really unique. No one thought I was trans, but I would get comments from people at work how I was ""bizarrely pretty for a guy"". I would wear makeup (mostly eyeliner) and cute unisex girls clothes, my old friends picked up on the makeup and told me ""it really suits you, for some reason"".

With all the feelings I had around being gendered female and looking at transition timelines of trans women and the effects of HRT, I became drawn to the idea of transitioning to female. I wasn't really 100% certain, but alot of signs were pointing to a good possibility that I was MtF and I really wanted to take hormones to further feminize myself. I went through the usual counselling and medical process to get HRT. My counsellor and I were fairly convinced I was female and would be happier making the transition. I started HRT and came out to my friends/family/work, which went surprisingly well, the majority of people were supportive and willing to work with me around pronouns, new name, bathrooms etc.

So I was on HRT and lived as a female full time for about a year. Overall I enjoyed the physical changes and being gendered female. The feelings of being on hormones made me feel alot more calmer and a bit warm and fuzzy. Howeve, my external life had become alot more awkward. I became a lot less confident in myself and became more negative about my body image, I put so much focus and energy and fear on passing. I went from being a fairly outgoing person to a bit of recluse, I wouldn't go out as much in public for fear of people staring at me and for someone who was previously extroverted and chatty, I stopped talking to people because I felt my voice was too deep. I also didn't know who I was anymore, I was trying so hard to bury my old male self but at the same time felt like I lost my familiar base, I didn't know how to be a woman. Life would fluctuate between feeling happy about obtaining my girl self, but for the most part just stressful and scary.

Overtime the initial coming out excitement wore off, I burn't out, spiraled into a pretty bad depression and ended up in hospital. What helped me recover was realising that I actually missed my old guy self, not the old old ""trying to fit in as a man"" guy self, but the pre-coming out androgynous/bishounen/girly guy self. By putting in so much energy to suppress that part of me to gain acceptance as a female as well as living in an almost non-genuine way to change into some kind of self perceived stereotype of a female, I was causing myself almost a reverse dysphoria. I also began to wonder whether transition was a mistake.

Anyway I stopped HRT, decided I wanted to detransition and went back to dressing as a guy (confusing a lot of people in the process). I felt relieved to let go of the pressure of passing, just rolled out of bed in the morning and throw on jeans and a tshirt, I could speak to people again because...who cares about my voice. My confidence began to come back. My friends continued to treat me as a female and use she/her pronouns and all of that still made me feel nice. After being off HRT for a while I began to feel anxiety, mostly around re-masculinizing and aging as a male (losing my hair, soft features and skin etc.). I hated when my male sex drive kicked in and overall i felt gross in my body. My desires around wanting to be perceived as female also started to return. So I went back on HRT and kind of switched between a boy and a girl mode depending on how confident I felt and what I felt like wearing day-to-day.

After a while my breasts began to grow, not huge (like an A cup), but big enough to be noticeable. I couldnt wear tight shirts and I certainly felt naked when I was topless (which sucked because I grew up on the beach and loved surfing without a shirt). Tbh I hate having breasts most of the time, they feel like really alien and I feel unattractive and awkward having them. I bind them using a tight sports bra most of the time. There are occasions when I do like them, when I'm feeling deeply female and I'm wearing a dress or top that needs filling out, also when I'm at home in my pjs I feel really cute. The biggest time I enjoy them is during sex, the sensations feel amazing and when I'm with a partner I feel like the female in bed. I've never enjoyed sex when I felt like a male.
So over the last year I've cycled on and off hormones. I go off them usually because the breast growth freaks me out and then back on them when the anxiety, ""gross in my body"", ""fear of masculine features returning"" feelings come back. Right atm I am living as my bishounen guy self the majority of the time and bind my chest, I even cut my hair mid length into a cute androgynous style, which has made me feel alot happier. I still have many days or longer periods of time where I really girl up and am happy being seen as female. I am really unsure what to do going from here, whether to go back on HRT forever or stay off them, I'm worried the cycling I'm doing will cause me health problems long term and my endo isn't experienced with someone doing that. My breasts still worry me, I've done some research on top surgery recently and I would be eligible for keyhole because they arn't very big. At the same time I wonder if I would regret having them removed sometimes.

The only other thing that bothers me is that I feel I lost something that was unique to me when I came out as transgender, which I can never get back. I truly miss being that ambiguous guy who was bending all the gender rules, now I feel my unique identity has been taken off me in some way and placed under the transgender label. I don't mean that in a negative way, but that could be partly some internalized transphobia at play. I guess when I was exploring, people saw me as a quirky confident David Bowie type, I was messing with peoples heads and people saw me as one of a kind, ""I don't know what's going on, but he is kind of cool"". After I came out: ""oh she's like Caitlyn Jenner"" or ""I saw a trans story on 60 minutes, you are so brave"", ""it must be so hard"". If I could do it over, I would transition and switch genders without ever coming out and I think my friends would have gone along with that.",zoltan2069,t2_do1ad,0.96,22,30

1263,6byhrn,2017-05-18,genderqueer,Feeling weird about my gender marker change,"Background: I went to the local FAA office this morning to get the name and gender marker updated on my pilot's license. (It has to match my driver's license, so I've gotta.) Walked out with a paper temporary in my new name, with an ""F"" on it.

So I was excited and posted a photo of the certificate on Facebook, along with a bit of snark (Doing my bit to increase the female pilot population! Overlooked diversity strategy: don't just encourage women to become pilots, encourage pilots to become women!). I took it down when I realized that nobody besides my wife and a few close friends know that I am actually legally a girl, and that between the snark and the license people were going to find out. The feds do not do that stuff on a whim.

I feel really weird about people knowing that I'm legally female. I'm nonbinary, but there's not really any visible difference between me and your garden-variety trans woman, so given that they made me choose between the two, female better matches my presentation... but I still feel like it's lying, because I still don't think of myself as a woman, and I feel like me claiming that is somehow offensive to people who actually are women, especially those who have had to work a lot harder than I have to get that status reflected on their documents.

I feel like for a lot of us, we're just trying to live our own truth and be free to express and present ourselves the way we want. And that's why we need to break free from gender, and tag ourselves as ""Genderqueer"". 
But if gender was not associated with any stereotype or pressure, and we would be free to express ourselves independently from our AGAB, would we still feel dysphoria? Would we still feel like we're not female/male/intersex humans if these words had no connotation or impact? 
And would some of us still go through surgery and hormone therapy? 

Of course, no one has the answer as this world does not exists, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on the question.

1265,4sgobb,2016-07-12,genderqueer,Would love some help with understanding,"Hi people,
I'm a bi, cisgendered guy, but have had some trouble understanding how being genderqueer works. I hope none of what I say comes across as offensive, that is not my intention at all. I would love to learn about this community so I can become more tolerant.

My major issue with understanding this community is my belief, or understanding that gender is a binary, at least socially. Physically people may be born without a clear gender, but socially gender seems to be pretty simple. We have stereotypes and social mores regarding what it means to be male or female. 
My question is basically, does a genderqueer person feel they are biologically between genders or socially between genders?
For example, do you feel like you have a set of genitals, but feel you belong to a different body? 
Or do you feel you are forced into social mores that you want to be free from? And why does being a feminine man or a masculine woman not go far enough?

I would really appreciate any feedback, since I desperately want to be able to say I support this community, as it is so evidentially full of wonderful people.

1266,yl6lv1,2022-11-03,genderqueer,Does anyone else relate to this?,"Just curious if anyone relates to this thought process/feeling and if so, what do you make of it for yourself? 

I'm AFAB and a few years ago, I thought I was genderqueer because half the time I wanted to present as a man. When I presented masculine, I wore a binder, men's clothing, and contoured my face. Sometimes I packed my pants too, just for the feeling. I was still very obviously AFAB because of my height and facial features, but people asked me what my pronouns were and that made me so happy. And growing up, I was often mistaken as a boy, which I loved. 

Then for the last few years, I lived in Korea where it is very heteronormative and gendered. I didn't really have the desire to present masculine. Actually, I became very stereotypically feminine and always wanted to be perceived as a pretty woman. Since I didn't have the desire to be a man while I was in Korea, I figured I was cis and liked to change things up in the US. 

I'm back in the US now and I'm getting back into presenting masculine sometimes. And I've been feeling that conflict again of wishing I could randomly wake up with a man's body maybe 1/3 of the time? I don't mind being a woman though. Actually, I love being a woman usually. I only get REALLY bothered and uncomfortable when I try to present masculine, but just look like a woman in men's clothing. My stomach drops, my skin crawls, and I feel kind of disgusted by myself?? And I dissociate unless I look ""masculine enough."" I both love and HATE how feminine my face is and how short I am.

1268,fe6ptz,2020-03-06,genderqueer,Cis woman confused about a few things due to some criticisms she has received lately.,"Hi there, I'm a 22 year old cis female.  This is a throwaway account in case anything in this thread causes an issue.  I have a few questions related to things a number of people have said to me. I have very short hair and how I dress varies widely from day to day - I rarely wear makeup (except goth makeup which is genderless), hate having painted nails, and most often wear ""masculine"" clothing.  I have small breasts and don't really sexualize them much, if that matters.  I have been mistaken for a guy and have had people tell me that I am, in fact, nonbinary, am lying to myself, or should ID as trans.  Where tf is this coming from?  Yet I think people would have the same issue if I did transition and then decided to wear a dress, as I sometimes, unusually, do.  But I thought transitioning was primarily related to feeling wrong in your body (completely understandable, though I am grateful that I haven't experienced it) rather than clothing choices, and I have no issue with having the parts that I have.

I do not understand the obsession with clothing and styling.  I don't feel that the way I dress and act is intentionally or even inherently masculine, I'm just doing what I like to do - what feels good to me.  Like I have since I was 4 and barely understood sexism, found it stupid that was considered weird or less friendly because I would fight and run and climb trees like boys just because I'm a girl.  Yet I am continuously asked why I have chosen not to ID as nonbinary or some such nonsense by people who are supposedly, cough, ""woke"".  If trans men can wear makeup without it making them less male (OF COURSE, DUH, MAKEUP ISN'T INHERENTLY FEMALE) why am I constantly made to feel out or place because I don't feel that my styling choices need affect my gender identity? Isn't part of society's problem the insistence that women or men DO have to act a certain way based on that fact alone?  Are all trans people body dysmorphic?  Once again, completely accepting regardless - everyone has a right to identify however makes them feel comfortable, ans I will always respect that.  I don't judge others for their personal, individual decisions, as a rule.  I just wonder if some of our ""liberal"" rhetoric has caused or been allowed to maintain other related societal problems.

1269,72u3dc,2017-09-27,genderqueer,The One and a Half Times I Was Harassed for My Gender Expression,"I have been exploring my gender for a few years, and while I'm still not totally used to the term, I've started labeling myself ""demi gendered."" For me, this means that I am totally comfortable identifying and expressing as a cis man, but I also drift into a non-binary area a lot of the time. My typical style combines menswear with the masculine side of women's clothes (button-downs; pixie pants; simple/subtle belts and watches…). I get a lot more adventurous for my Instagram (not linked to preserve semi-anonymity for this acct.), and I have even worn a fairly short skirt in public once. I also always have my hand-me-down purple Coach shoulder bag.

**Take encouragement, all who are nervous about expressing themselves in ways that don't fit societal norms:** I have almost never faced negative reactions in public, even in a conservative-leaning city. In fact, that one time I wore a skirt out on the street, I got compliments from a few strangers—and I never shave my beard; I was clearly a man in a skirt.

Despite my overwhelmingly neutral treatment, I am still often self-conscious when walking in public with not-totally-masculine attire. Just a couple weeks ago, I was walking home while presenting entirely masculine except for my purse, which I wear across my shoulder like a messenger bag. I was imagining telling someone about the one time I had faced slight push-back for my gender exploration (a lot of my thoughts take place as kind of practice conversations).

The incident took place in one of our local Dillards stores. The layout has all the men's clothing on one level and all the women's downstairs. I was poking through the skirts and found a few I wanted to try on. I was definitely not going to take the escalator up to find the men's fitting rooms, so I walked toward the ones by the bras and sleepwear.

**PRO TIP: Always act like you belong where you are.** You don't need to have a chip on your shoulder, but never apologize with your body language. I have tried on women's clothes in Target, JCPenney, Ross, Shopko, Nordstrom, every shop in the malls... With the exception of this one time, the changing room staff have never batted an eye. (Actually, JCP often doesn't have anyone staffing the changing rooms, so if you're especially self-conscious, you might try there first)

Anyway, I was walking purposefully toward the dressing area when I heard from behind me a panicked ""Sir? Sir??"" I sighed to myself, but kept my head high as I turned to see a female attendant, middle-aged or maybe a bit older, urgently making her way toward me. ""You can't go in there,"" she said emphatically, but trying to keep her composure, ""Those are the women's rooms.""

I can understand protecting women's privacy and safety, but it's worth noting here that the rooms were not stalls divided by bathroom-like partitions with big gaps at the bottom; nor did they have curtains, like at H&amp;M (whose dressing rooms are co-ed, incidentally). Dillards is a semi-fancy outlet, and their dressing rooms have full doors with locks.

I told the woman that I just wanted to try on a few things and showed her my skirts. She was obviously taken aback, and called over another employee—a supervisor, I think—for advice. She explained the situation half under her breath to her superior, ""He wants to try on some… skirts.""

The other woman, younger, but with the self possession of a manager, was totally unfazed. ""That's alright. He can do that."" So I did. The attendant was still flustered and confused, but just kind of shuffled off to reorganize a rack somewhere. It was a very tame experience (for me; that lady was shaken by it, I guess) and it goes to show that if you project calm, shopkeepers are rarely going to give you much grief; they're professionals. That was the ""half"" time I was harassed.

I was thinking about all of that, and how lucky I have been, as I walked on the sidewalk. I always feel in the back of my mind that there's another shoe that's waiting to drop, and somebody's going to call me out or accost me. There's also a feeling like I don't deserve to be part of the queer community because I have lived my life with all of the straight-cis-male privilege (I'm actually ostensibly pan, but that's another conversation) and have never been made to feel unsafe or unwelcome because of my identity. 

Just as I stepped onto the grass to walk around to the front of the house, a car drove by behind me and I heard someone yell ""Fucking f****t!"" and I thought ""There it is. I can check that off."" They kept driving, and I kept walking.

I haven't had a chance since then to dress femme in public, but my hope is that the pressure is less now. Sometimes a negative experience can validate all the other, positive experiences. There are far too many instances, nationwide, of people being beaten or killed for their identities, and I will fully admit that I have grown up with immense social privilege (even ignoring the somewhat controversial idea of ""passing privilege""). Nevertheless, I hope these stories encourage you to own yourselves and express yourselves bravely. **You have a right to be here. You belong.**",asbestosbill,t2_dicz7,0.93,55,4
1270,wb64o,2012-07-10,genderqueer,Does anyone have children and how do they incorporate their gender fluidity and/or cross dressing into their family lives?,"I amm cross posting this to a couple different gender/sexuality reddits, so I apologize if it is seen too many times, but thesis a very important issue to me that I am needing to figure out and hopefully in doing so will help others in similar situations as well.

My wife and I (m) are both a bit alternative, both bi, kinky, Burners, etc.  Just stating that to give a brief background, however we are also both mature, stable, responsible adults, we own our own home, she has a professional well paying job, I am an artist and a stay at home parent.  So we recently had our first and only kid (getting a vasectomy so it's for sure), and we are going to provide the best life possible and be the best parents possible.

My wife knows about my CD and is very supportive, I was actually in CD when we met, and she helps me pick out my CD outfits and do my makeup, etc.   I don't do CD 24/7, I consider myself gender queer and not trans, thus I don't want to be a woman or even look like a woman all the time, I am a person that likes having fun with his look, usually more on the effeminate, gay boy look or of course full CD or sissy look.  If anything, the look I like to have is very girly, girly boy look.

We both want to raise our child to be free thinking, open minded and non prejudicial, conformist or biased towards anything and this includes gender, gender stereotypes and clothing.  So if he wants to wear all blue and only overalls and jeans that is fine but if he wants to wear pink tutus and fairy wings with a tiara that is fine too, I won't push him either way or put my CD issues or beliefs on him, I just want him to know that he can dress and look however he wants and his parents will defend and support him in his choices.  Just as he can play rugby or dance ballet, it is up to him.

Now, I don't want this to sound selfish, but I don't think I should change my lifestyle in who I am at my core and get rid of my love and desire to CD and wear costumes, accessorize, wear jewelry and have girly or gay boy fashion sense, just so I can appear to be a""normal"" parent and so he won't be teased that his dad is a fag or whatever.  I hope that I can bring him up as an artist/costumer/burner/sculptor/etc, who will appreciate deviation from the norm and defend his dad's eccentricity and life choices.  In short, like most all parents, I hope to instill in him with what I see as the right values and morals.

Anyhow, the question and issue I want to pose to others is that right now our son is an infant and too small to understand, but as he grows older, assuming I don't decide to give up CD when around him and keep it to just private outings and parties, then he is going to see dad dressed up.  Thus I would love to know how other parents handle or plan to handle this situation.  How do you or did you intend to explain it, how did your child react, etc.  

Btw, in closing, I think it should be noted, as to me it makes a difference in respect to this situation, that I don't usually do the full CD with a wig and make up.  I do enjoy those things, but keep them more for parties.  My view on clothing actually is that all clothing is gender neutral and anyone should be able to wear anything they want.  Thus, when hanging around the house, I might slip into a tshirt and sweat pants or a skirt with leggings and a tshirt or jeans and a blouse, or jeans and a tshirt with pink panties underneath or any combination of anything.  Personally this is what I want my child to become used to and cool with, not with me looking like another gender or completely other person but rather just enjoying a wide variety and style of clothes.

Sorry for the length, but I have been wanting to ask this for a long time.

Being AMAB, I have been following a lot of transfem online spaces but have had a bit of a hard time relating to some of the struggles. Dysphoria is rarely a problem, but I experience strong euphoria from some of my more feminine looks! I lean strongly towards an androgynous aesthetic and try to embrace that rather than trying to pass as female - as such, I'm transitioning to somewhere in the in the middle of the gender spectrum. I've been thinking about HRT for a few years now and I think the effects (a chest, however small, thinner body hair, neater skin) all would make me very happy and represent closer my personality.

There is a problem, though. I'm concerned that gender clinics are more rooted in a binary view of gender, and will discount me for not wanting to transition to a female gender, having my name changed, etc. A few years ago, I heard from some transfems stories of the clinic having a very stereotyped view of gender, focused towards a perception of self as a woman. I think it would be hard to explain that I'm unhappy being viewed as a man, but at the same time not being comfortable with being a woman?

So I'm afab and genderfluid, but only slightly. I mostly switch between being nonbinary and a demi-man, and occasionally being a binary man, and even more rarely I'll have no gender at all. The times someone has accidently used he/him for me have given me euphoria, but it doesn't always feel right because of my fluidity. But like, some days they/them doesn't feel right either, just feels like the only option since I HATE she/her for myself, even on the 1% days that I swing over to be extremely fem (which causes me to question if I temporarily a woman lol). 

Something that's super weird is having two names. I have a gender nuetral nick name that I use at work and with friends. But I came up with an extremely masc name for my legal name (named after a Greek god bc I'm the typical enby LOL). 
After using this gender neutral nick name, I've noticed it's very special to me and I want to reserve it for only friends to use. Having a coworker who hated me use it made me sad. So going into a new job, I'm using my new legal name, which again is super masc, and also I'm less emotionally attached to. 

My nickname got mistaken for a fem name a lot because I'm very clearly not medically transitioned. I hated this, I want to reserve the name only for people who know my gender and who support me. 

My point with the names is that, part of my pronoun choice is based on my name I've noticed. When I use my nickname, he/him or even they/he seems like people would think it's strange and doesn't even seem to fit. Seems like an exclusivly they/them name somehow. As for my legal name, it feels like it could easily be a they/he name. 

I know I shouldn't base my pronouns on how other people may perceive my name, or even what's easier for them (even supportive people have really struggled with the grammar of they/them in my life). But I also genuinly want to give he/him a shot to see if it consistently brings me euphoria or not.

*Let me start out with full disclosure; I am a cis-gendered white woman in my mid-30s. I am privileged and have been spared by life's lottery many of the struggles that others deal with. I haven't been through what others have been through and so there will be aspects of your experience that have never even occurred to me. I'm here to learn. I am aware of my ignorance and hope to correct it through a mindful exchange of perspective and ideas.*

*I identify as an ally based on the belief that everyone has a human right to explore life in whatever way they're drawn to, so long as nobody is hurting each other. This includes gender identity, sexual orientation, and other philosophies and cultural norms/rules.*

*I agree many of today's gender norms are pretty toxic, so I'm in favor of our society looking at these social and cultural ideas as the intangible things they are and choosing to re-define and relax them so we can expand our state of being.*

*Please excuse me if I over-explain, am too formal, or talk too much, it is related to C-PTSD.*

\------------------------------------------------------------

My 15-year-old niece/nephew has come out as bi and gender-fluid with shifting pronouns, but her/his parents are both transphobic and homophobic.

The mother is a kind of ""fear-of-the-unknown"" phobic. Trans identity is so foreign to her that it freaks her out, plus it's condemned by her religion (not really, but since homophobia is, the church has lumped them in together.) She knows discouraging her kid would be wrong and is trying to adjust but she has severe anxiety due to C-PTSD (same source as me) so confronting her fears and stepping outside her comfort zone is harder for her than for some people. Her trauma-induced neurodivergence makes her associate phobia-based fear (and confronting it) with a real-life threat. She has a shut-down coping mechanism. ***This is not an excuse***, and she is seeking professional treatment, but that's going to be a long journey and her kid needs her to be able to address this issue productively *right now*.

The father is unapologetically a product of generations of hardcore conservative Christian extremist bigotry. His mother is from the Bible Belt and his father was Chilean, apparently from a sub-culture that was both conservative and oppressive to women. He is actually unwilling to change his perspective on this, feels he has a moral high ground, and ""his daughter"" is either mentally ill or a ""spoiled brat doing this because it's trendy"", etc. etc. etc. (Yes, I have told my sister that her husband is legit verbally abusive.)

They're both more upset about the gender identity than the sexual orientation.

The mom is taking a stand against her husband, in defense of their teen, but has expressed that she doesn't even understand (and is uncomfortable with) the issue she's defending. Kiddo has a key to my apartment if she needs an escape.

\------------------------------------------------------------

What I need help with is that I'm not familiar enough with the type of gender identity kiddo is expressing. I tried asking her/him about it but she/he has underdeveloped interpersonal skills and can't articulate clearly what she/he needs from us - which isn't helped at all by the dad being angry and yelling. Kiddo is withdrawing somewhat.

Kiddo says she/he identifies as gender-fluid, specifically female most of the time, but sometimes she/he just feels like a boy. She/he wants to go clothes shopping to get some masculine clothes for when needed. Preferred pronouns are ""She/Her or He/Him"" depending on current state of being.

While I get this in theory, in practice it's a little difficult because it's so internalized. Like, to be respectful and supportive should my sister and I ask what the pronouns are every time we interact with Kiddo? What if the father overhears and starts in? Would it be hurtful to use ""they/their"" if we're not sure? I get that She/He would not be appropriate when actually referring to Kiddo in person, but when referring to Her/Him in third person like this it feels logical. Please correct me if wrong.

I tentatively suggested to Kiddo, maybe, if the idea didn't make her/him uncomfortable... a reversible bracelet, to signal gender preference to close friends and family? Something that can be switched much faster and easier than changing clothes.

I'm not sure if that idea is something that would offend most other people, but for a kid living in a phobic household who has trouble communicating, maybe?

Gonna take Kiddo clothes shopping if the mom and dad won't.

***I don't really have a specific question, I'm looking for insight. Anyone else identify this way who can help me understand better, so I can help Kiddo and my sister?***

People rarely understand just how offensive it really is to accuse a nonbinary person of being too masculine or feminine in a bad way. Whether it's being wussy or sensitive, or mansplaining.

The OP said: *""...when people respond with that sort of word or other similar dismissing 'Well you're just a man so blah blah blah...' in response to me voicing either a more conservative viewpoint, or disagreeing with a point of feminist ideology, it plays into this awful stereotype that all trans people must think alike, so if you don't think like that then you're not legitimately trans you're just some shitty frat dudebro or whatever the left-wing stereotype is.""This stuff makes me feel like, I'm only trans when it feels good for other people to 'protect' me. I'm suddenly not trans when people dislike what I'm trying to say, especially if being 'male' gives them fuel to attack me or dismiss my voice.""*

For a lot of people, validating the gender spectrum is about making themselves feel good. These are the worst kinds of allies, because they don't hold in true faith to us unless it validates them. ""I'll only validate you if it validates me."" is quid pro quo.

22 / born female 
Since last year I’ve been questioning my gender more seriously, taking the time to think. And I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m non binary. 

Going back to the past I always thought that something was off. I’ve never really felt like a women or felt comfortable with everyone seeing me that way and expressing femininity. Not really questioning because I was “one of the boys” and not like other girls. I even used to think in 8th grade that I was an homosexual man instead of a straight woman...??? And not give it a second thought.
But as a young adult,  getting into feminism theory I associated it with being internalized misogyny. I reconciled with my femininity and started to express it with no shame. But something still felt off.
I started to feel really uncomfortable with my body (especially my breasts). I have confidence in my feminine body because I know it fit beauty standards, but it doesn’t feel like myself (I hope it makes sense). 

Sometimes I still think that I’m faking it, that it’s just me rejecting gender roles assigned to me and not my identity. 

I like expressing femininity, but I’m not a woman. 
I want to cry every time I think about it because I feel like it would be more validating if I was born male and then identified as non-binary and express myself feminine. But I know is wrong to think that way.

1286,9mtfav,2018-10-09,genderqueer,Anyone else with separate sexual/social identities?,"I've come to realize that I very much identify differently based on situation. 98% of the time, I identify as male; I'm happy with having my breasts removed, I wince and cringe at female pronouns, and I try to be as masculine as I reasonably can  be to aid in passing. I use my legally changed, male name, and it bothers me a lot if someone addresses me as my old name or using female pronouns.

But then the 2% (if not less) of the time where I'm in a sexual situation, it's like everything flips. Originally, I just assumed this was because I had ladybits and wasn't imaginative enough to fantasize about having manbits, but over time, this hasn't really seemed to change, even after having top surgery. I've noticed that when it comes to sexual situations, I act significantly more feminine (I giggle more, when typing I use more superfluous emoji than I normally do, which is already a lot), and more to the point, I actually identify as female. Using male pronouns doesn't bother me, exactly, but it feels less 'normal' or 'right' than using female ones. I haven't tried using my dead name in a sexual situation, but sexual situations are the one time I actually find myself missing my breasts, even if the thought of having them again triggers *intense* dysphoria during any non-sexual moment of my life. In day-to-day life, getting called cute bothers me, but being called adorable or precious (which are normally even worse) in sexual situations make me feel proud?

I've kind of come to accept that my gender identity switch does a 180 between what I consider my 'social' gender identity vs my sexual gender identity, but I'm wondering if anyone else experiences this (particularly trans people who have had HRT and/or surgery)? I've never heard of a similar situation, but on the other hand, I almost never hear about how sexual acts factor into people's gender identities, so idk. ><

...also, is there an actual *word* for this?

She said she hates that she is called girly for liking pink and cute stuffs because pink is just a color and cute stuffs are just cute. She asked me if this was internalized misogyny or not and I kinda see it as one because ig as someone who acts more boyish and have more boyish interests but dresses very feminine I had no problem being called “you’re basically a guy” or “you’re so girly and feminine” because I just think of me as as me and I think I shouldn’t really conform to gender norms whether what is female or what is male nor should I be offended being described either. Especially being called girly because I just think hey being female is amazing tho what’s wrong with being called feminine. I also took into account my brother who has very feminine interests but still acts masculine and still likes some boy things like gaming and sports. His favorite color is pink and would often buy stuffs in that color, likes cute stuffs, knows a lot of skincare and make up, he doesn’t give a sht when someone calls him gay or girly bc he thinks it shouldn’t be an insult or should make him uncomfortable bc there’s nothing wrong with being one? But she kinda insists that’s it’s more of and identity than internalized misogyny and we kinda went back and forth for an hour on why it’s or why it isn’t and ig there is justification on both sides.

But ever since I was 11 I have liked to masturbate wearing female clothes, when I was young didn't gave it importance, later I thought it was eventually going to pass, but now is getting out of hand, my wife allows me to wear her panties which I do some days and all day long as aroused as it gets, but she doesn't know that I masturbate or at least she pretends she doesn't (really can't tell). She thinks that is only a bottom underwear thing but when I have the chance (she is spending the day with her mom etc) I wear all female clothes, it turns me on so bad.

Also the idea of having female breast drives me crazy, sometimes I fantasize  of transitioning to a female body but keeping my dingo, or being able to go out with full female clothes, but then I snap out of it and start feeling worried, I don't have the slightest feminine look, I would be an average man with boobs or a male with the wrong wardrobe, and in my country they are fairly homophobic, a slight change of someone not being straight is source of mockery and humiliation, so no even a chance of making them understand that there may be something in the middle,  my family and friendships would be ashamed and would never talk to me again.

I have been having encountered emotions and I have no idea how to deal with that, on one hand the stereotyped part of me which believes is the right thing to do wants to fully stop and just be the big ""macho"" for my wife, and on the other hand I would like to be fully honest with her but I think that could jeopardize my marriage.

I was born female and given a very feminine name that has no chance of being slightly altered to male (like going from Victoria to Victor or Nicole to Nicholas). It's also a name that does not have a shortened version, like Sam for Samantha or Liz for Elizabeth. I grew up hating the color pink and refusing to wear dresses, but enjoyed painting my nails and keeping my hair long.

&#x200B;

Hitting puberty was a tough time for me. I hated the boobs that grew in, but my period didn't feel wrong. Perhaps I hated the attention I got from my growing chest, or maybe it's because I was the first in my class to start developing and I wasn't confident. I honestly have no idea, even today. Not once have I ever thought ""I don't belong in this body"" or ""I don't like being called 'she,'"" but I do remember wearing 4 training bras at once, hoping that my breasts would stop growing, and being insulted by the word ""girly.""

Here's the tricky part... I only want to present masculinely sometimes. There are days when I'll look at myself in the mirror and embrace my feminine figure. There are other days when I'll wake up and feel unhappy until I have my binder on and have my hair shoved into a beanie. On a daily basis, I wear men's jeans and boxer-briefs regardless of what I wear on top, but I've never once had the desire to have male genitals. I wear makeup and nail polish regardless if I'm presenting more masculine or feminine.

I've been looking for the right terminology for years, but not very hard cuz I just felt this huge judgement block in myself and the culture around me. And yet, I've made what I see now is extremely gender fluid art for years - music and film that explores feeling like a paradox: the weird blurry self-image that can result from always trying to figure out who i ""actually"" am, versus learning to see being a spectrum in motion as beautiful and okay. I just finished writing a ballet about gender fluidity, even though I was too afraid to admit to myself that thats what its about for the 2 years I worked on it. I thought the ballet was about healing my relationship with being femm, but after doing a lot of work on myself to heal that part of me, I can see that it honestly isn't the house I live in- just a room I spend time in. It feels amazing to be accepting this about myself. But anyway: 

My biggest apprehension is the women in my life who are gonna feel like I am ""abandoning"" the club of cis women. Like it's the ""easy way out"" of being a woman, to declare being queer. Like being a cis woman is an age-old predicamnent, and everyone afab has to like, band together. I've had this conversation with multiple cis women in my life, and seen it on forums. They usually think there are ""real"" trans people (or what they think of as trans), and then a whole buncha trendy fakers. Which is so weird and sad to me, because (and plz correct me if this is whack)- even IF that were somehow true and people were """"pretending"""" to be queer, wouldn't that be ultimately... who cares? We are living in such an incredible magical period of opening up our self-expressions and collective understanding of gender, and if people try on terminology and explore their identity, isn't that ultimately GOOD? maybe I am way off, but I wanna live in a society where you have to get to know each person to learn who they are, how they wanna be treated, etc. without the weird assumptions that come with the two party gender system. Does this make sense? 

It just makes me really sad that cis women I know and see online can view queerness as a threat to their fight for equality, or something that can only be true for a few people while others are """"faking it as a trend"""". It makes me scared that I'm gonna get interrogated. Especially after I've been interrogating myself about this in my head for years lol
Has anyone else experienced this? Any recs for if it comes up? I don't just wanna kick people out of my life - I've had similarly problematic thoughts at times in my process, and who's to say some of these people aren't repressing a more complex gender experience of their own?

I feel like behavior and sports and stuff like that, doesn't define someone's gender as these are mostly stereotypes (men like football, women don't) and are incorrect as hell. Also certain characteristics assigned to genders are mostly stereotypes, so they can't define my gender as well.

Secondly I feel like my body itself doesn't define my gender as well, because my body defines my sex, so it shouldn't have anything to do with my gender.

Lastly, clothing isn't a factor as well, because I feel that again it's mostly our society that assigned the clothing to a specific gender, instead of a gender specifically adhering to certain clothes.

So what makes a gender?

I was born as a male (sex) and have always been called male and have called myself male, but where lies the difference between 'male' and 'female'? Is there even a difference? I hope someone may help me out.",IGenderOffender,t2_p2gkl,1.0,7,5

1300,5hu1v5,2016-12-12,genderqueer,how do you resolve a genderqueer identity with a female identity...,"I was reading Nevada, again, and came across a part talking about internet communities and this question came along. Its kinda relatable to me, but Ill let other folks reflect on it. Sorry if it bothers folks cause its kinda worded in a polarizing way as the main character in the book isn't supposed to be likeable.

""how do you resolve a
genderqueer identity with a female identity when it
seems like acknowledging the restraints of female
identity and then bursting them doesn’t make you
no longer female, just empowered, and therefore is
genderqueer a privileged identity that’s mostly
available to female-assigned people with punk rock
haircuts, in college""?

The only significant aspect of my identity at this point is pretty much ""not a dude"". Most things trans women say resonate with me, but I'm kinda butch and don't have a sense of connection to a gender identity.At the same time, I feel like cis women treat me as less than a woman or some sort of other despite being on hormones and it makes me want to switch from they to she. So I dont know, empowered butch trans woman or nb at this point I dont care but I feel each has its drawbacks as to how normies relate to me. 

Also this is not an ""Am I X"" post, but more asking to how people relate to gender and the decision to choose GQ, NB, or a binary identity with the understanding that they are liberated.",cantaloupemelon,t2_yj77g,0.94,13,18
1301,5m93ny,2017-01-05,genderqueer,What are your safe spaces away from all-or-nothing thinking?,"One of my biggest tensions with gender has been the prevalence of all-or-nothing thinking.

It comes up in more transparent ways, with the gender binary, the idea that you're either a woman or a man, and that's the end of the story.  I see this both in transphobic settings (i.e. the assertion that AFAB people are ""just women"" and AMAB people are ""just men"" and ""that's just the way it is."") as well as in some more liberal circles, like when people assert ""Trans women are women"" and ""Trans men are men.""  Like, I want to respect trans people's identities unconditionally, but I sometimes feel uncomfortable with this narrative in how it gets forced on people.  I have seen trans people get ""corrected"" if/when they say things like ""Back when I was a man"" or ""Back when I was a woman"" and then people say ""But you've always been a woman / man"".  I get super uncomfortable in a space where people ""correct"" other trans people's narratives like this...it feels like they're forcing them into a box, telling them how to think in a coercive way.

It's like, there are all these different definitions of ""woman"" and ""man"" floating around out there.  And one of the main reasons I identify as nonbinary is that they don't line up for me.  By some definitions, I'm a man because I'm AMAB and because of my biology.  But by other definitions I've never fit the idea of maleness, because of how I think and operate.  Then there's how I'm gendered by others, which depends on the setting and the person.

I feel most comfortable when people see and acknowledge all the nuances of gender...when they're not trying to force people into boxes and categories.  One reason I like the term ""nonbinary"" is specifically because it rejects the categories...it says: ""No, I don't fit into the woman box, nor do I fit into the man box.  I'm outside the boxes."" and it doesn't make any more statements beyond these.  I have become increasingly less comfortable though, saying ""I am nonbinary"", instead preferring to say ""I identify as nonbinary.""  I don't want to say I ""am"" anything because that seems to gloss over all the nuances, all the ways in which my experiences of gender are complex and sometimes disjoint.

I find though that all-or-nothing thinking has infiltrated many of the supposedly trans-friendly spaces that I'm a part of.  I don't like the cis vs. trans distinction, and I find people often talk about it in ways I feel really uncomfortable with.  I feel like my own experience blurs the boundaries between cis and trans experience and identity.  It's like, technically, I'm trans, because my identity doesn't match my assigned birth sex.  But I also don't experience strong dysphoria, and I don't want to pursue HRT or surgery.  I don't want to get into the realm of comparing people as being ""more trans"" or ""less trans"" but I do feel like there are ways in which my experience fits some cis people's more closely than some trans people's.  Also, there are a lot of settings where I can ""pass"" as cis, and I had many years living thinking I was cis, because I had no concept of nonbinaryness.  So there's a large degree to which I identify both with cis *and* trans people.  And I get really uncomfortable when people bash, or make negative generalizations about cis people.  I get uncomfortable even when people label or identify other people as cis, like assuming people are cis, because people assumed that about me for years when I am not really fully cis.  I also just...I dunno...the whole idea of having to pick cis or trans bothers me, just like having to pick female or male on some form bothers me.

My closest friends get this stuff, and support me, but I often feel really uncomfortable in left-wing spaces because they often get sucked into all-or-nothing thinking based on group identity.  This seems to have gotten worse after the 2016 election, which I understand somewhat, because I think people have a tendency to get angry and worked up in response to hate speech, and there was a ton of hate speech floating around (including a lot directed at me).  But like...I still don't like it.  I don't feel safe around all-or-nothing thinking.

I feel frustrated, like, often far-left spaces are the only spaces that are explicitly embracing of my nonbinary identity...but they often end up buying into aspects of identity politics and left-wing ideology that I can get very uncomfortable with.

Are others out there also bothered by this stuff?  What do you do to get away from it?  Are there groups you've found where you really feel safe from all-or-nothing categorizations?",cazort2,t2_4gpcz,0.92,22,12

Trying to get a handle on exactly what my gender is leads to stress and confusion and beating myself up for not being able to figure it out, or even the rare panic attack. I can't scrape the surface beyond ""sure as hell not a man."" So I settled on genderqueer. Also the colors of the flag are buzz lightyear's colors so that's a plus.

I didn't start having a problem with dysphoria until a few weeks ago when I suddenly found myself wishing I was more androgynous or feminine, and theb I started having on and off bouts of dysphoria and ""oh my god get me out of this body"". I'm 6'5, broad shouldered, kinda hairy with a square jaw. If I were cis I'd feel like hot shit about that but now I find myself hating everything about my body that should give me confidence and just feeling like normal temperature shit. And god help me if I get a compliment on my appearance.

Like I said I would think about how I'd prefer to be androgynous. But a few days ago... (please don't laugh) I was reading a fan fiction about vampires and there was just suddenly a whole chapter that was just two vampire women... having sex (which they did NOT warn me would happen in the tags btw).

Anyway, as I very awkwardly read it I didn't find myself thinking ""wow this is hot"" I was feeling... I don't know how to describe it. Any line that described anything about one of the character's bodies (any part, not just the sexy parts) made me feel, ""jealousy"" isn't the right word. I guess ""yearning"" works, not yearning to be in that situation but yearning to be in the body of the women, and since then every once in awhile I feel that again. Think about what it would be like to have body of the women, how maybe I wouldn't be so miserable, wishing I could be a shapeshifter though that's less plausible.

Then I've got fucking imposter syndrome whispering in my ear trying to convince me I'm lying to myself about all of this to feel special. Which is just great.

I just feel confused. I don't know who I am, I've read about the experience of trans women and I don't know if that's me, I just... I'm lost. There's so much weird shit in my life and everything is changing and fucked up and i just want something to make sense but all I can think about is this and how turned around I feel.

With me being a fairly petite 5'3 female it made a lot of difference. When this happened I lost all of my curves. I used to be a D cup and am now an A. and have a fairly flat rear. Lol. also at that time i cut my hair from about waist high to shoulder length. ALSO I hadn't had a period in over a year due to birth control... fast forward a couple months out of no where I began questioning my sexuality. And then came to the conclusion that I am bi. THEN I began questioning my gender. I'm 20 years old and have never questioned it before. Never had a problem being a female although I always hated gender stereotypes and roles. I was always a bit of a tomboy. Anyway I began thinking more and more that I don't nessacarilly feel like a woman. I have a hard time relating to other girls and things they like. Although I have no desire to rid myself of my feminine parts. I've never desired to grow a beard or be masculine. I'm wondering if all these feminine traits (big boobs, butt, curves, period, long hair) were the only things making me actually feel like a woman and wonder if other women just FEEL like women regardless of all those characteristics. Now I really don't mind having a flatter chest and when I imagine myself with a very womanly body (imagine kim Kardashian hour glass lol) I feel like a very anxious nervous feeling. Like I said I don't want to be a boy but I don't really feel like a woman. Does this make me gender queer? I do experience slight body dysmorphia. I feel slightly uncomfortable with my female parts sometimes but I don't want male parts. Nor do I have an issue using them sexually or otherwise like going to the bathroom.

\[I'd love to hear about your story, thank you very much in advance if you decide to share\]

&#x200B;

Here's my experience if you're interested:

I've been questioning my gender for over a yearHow and when did you ""figure out"" your gender? How and when did you ""know""?

 now and I've still not quite figured it out.

I've been thinking I might be ***non binary*** and ***genderfluid***, but I'm still not sure.

* I'm ***AFAB*** and I don't feel legitimate as I feel like my gender *fluctuates*, I happen to feel ""*woman-ly*\*\*""\*\* and *nb*, or something else than ""*woman*"" as in a ""*gray area*"". (I had a point where I thought I was *bigender*, more specifically *bigirl*, but saying *bigirl* gives the girl part too much attention, which doesn't feel as right as it used to)
* I would not feel comfortable with ""he/him"" pronouns. But I do with ***she/her*** and ***they/them*** pronouns. Although, I really dislike to be referred to ""madam"" or such things.
* I deeply reject social gender norms as well, but I don't know if it's because I'm deconstructing myself from social constructs or because it's on a personal level.
* The same goes for the clothes I wear, I like clothes from the men's and women's section. I sometimes like to wear one more than the other, it fluctuates.
* I also like to have body hair and not shave them which makes me feel good and less ""woman-ly"" (as in the social stereotype and norm for women), and more me? like ""damn I don't look \*stereotypically or typically to disgusting social norms\* like a woman""
* I used to ""defend"" nb people, and it'd hurt when they would get misgendered or invalidated by others. However, now it hurts me on an another level. Personal level.

When I talk about it I'm feeling very good and authentic. Then when I don't talk about it, I feel like it's all a lie? and I feel weird? **Especially** after talking about it with close-friends as they don't know much about it all...

&#x200B;

I'm genderqueer, I'm queer. I'll say that so I don't have to put any gender or anything on it whilst figuring it all out. Talking about it now, I'd say I'm NB. Ugh.

Someone accidentally referring to me as ""them"", reading a book with a non-binary character, following nb people on internet, talking about it to a couple of people around me, and Sam Smith coming out as non binary pushed me to talk about trying they/them pronouns to my close friends. And questioning my gender even more.

Cisgender people, for example, don't have to fear mockery and ridicule when leaving the house each day for not adhering to binary gender stereotypes, they don't have to worry about the conundrum of which public restroom to use so as not to be beaten up or yelled at, they don't have to jump through hurdles of correcting people about their name and pronouns, they don't have to struggle to find clothes that fit their body type since mainstream fashion encourages gender normativity, they aren't told to ""think of the children"" by parents who insist their gender expression poses a danger to little kids, they don't have to routinely second guess the meaning and significance of cisnormativity in every aspect of their personal life, they don't run the risk of being disowned by their family or fired from their job or refused service by a business for subverting the conventions of manhood or womanhood, everyone they encounter on the street, at the store, at school, and in the workplace looks and acts virtually the same way they do, and everytime they turn on the TV or a movie or a music video or open a magazine or book they see people that also look and act much like they do to remind them that how they are is 100% normal and accepted everywhere. That is the privilege of being ""cisgender"", almost none of which applies to being an openly feminine male in many parts of the world.

1309,zy0gub,2022-12-29,genderqueer,"Misgendering in t4nb relationships / Being treated as a ""fill in the blank"" when dating","Hey! So I (20, transmasc nb) use they/them pronouns and identify as pansexual but usually seek out t4t relationships. (I'm also pre-op so I don't pass for a guy super often just yet, but I make it clear to all my partners that I feel more aligned with masculinity than with feminity.) **T4T/ Nb4Nb/ T4Nb is supposed to be a safe dynamic** for nb and trans ppl, but something I've been noticing, especially with 2 of my past pre-op trans partners, is this **trend of assigning me whatever gender role validates their own identity** at a given moment, so I'm wondering if anyone else has dealt with this because I can't tell if I'm going crazy.

To elaborate, I started dating both of these people while they were still just starting to question their genders, the first person was FTM and the second was MTF.

With the FTM partner, he used to affirm my identity as an nb when he wanted a sympathetic listener to talk about his dysphoria and questioning journey, but in most other contexts he'd treat me like a girl or slip & call me his gf. I always got the vibe that it was because me being ""the girl"" in the relationship made him feel more like ""the guy,"" but I never confirmed this.

With the (then bisexual) MTF partner, she also acknowledged my genderqueerness when she wanted to talk about maybe transitioning, and she *also* frequently talked about how much she wanted to be a lesbian & have our love be sapphic. We both know/knew ""lesbian"" can generally refer to relationships between any 2 non-men, not just 2 binary women, but she also frequently slipped and used she/her pronouns for me, and I was her first AFAB partner. <-- This made me suspect she also saw me as a girl to the extent that it made her feel more valid as a budding lesbian trans woman, especially because she didn't consider any of her past relationships with genderqueer non-op/pre-op AMABs to be sapphic in nature. ([Also idk if this context is necessary, but it's relatively common for trans people's sexualities to shift or change altogether as they transition, she was going through something similar, article further explaining this linked](https://www.them.us/story/sexual-attraction-after-transition))

So yeah, can any other nb people relate to experiencing this sort of misgendering (or any misgendering tbh) within t4t or t4nb dynamics / having your trans partner basically act like you being nonbinary means they can assign you whatever role makes them feel euphoric? And do any binary trans people have thoughts on this as well? I'm hoping these two situations were just unfortunate coincidences and not evidence of a widespread problem, but I feel kinda alone and I'm not sure how to address this if it happens again.

Also plz lmk if there's any problematic language or implications in here! I've been having a really hard time figuring out what to look up to find discourse on this specific issue, (seems like the only kind of nb-exclusion/invalidation ppl want to talk abt is transmedicalism), so I have no clue whether I might accidentally be feeding some obscure misconceptions or stereotypes about binary trans folx. In a similar vein, **transphobic and/or transmedicalist replies will not be tolerated!**

This despite the fact that Riki Wilchins, a highly-respected genderqueer activist and pioneer, has long fought for ""gender expression"" as a civil right:

[An Interview with GenderPAC's Riki Wilchins](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315280058_An_Interview_with_GenderPAC's_Riki_Wilchins)

Many cities and states already recognize that BOTH ""gender identity"" and ""gender expression"" as protected personal characteristics for purposes of non-discrimination statutes and ordinances. Somehow local and state lawmakers are more willing to confer human rights protections equitably and fairly for gender nonconforming people, unlike our own federal government.

For example, [Fair and Equal Michigan](https://i.imgur.com/T7x3mJQ.png) understands the true meaning of equality. The grassroots coalition aims to protect Michigan citizens from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.

New York State went one step further by naming their human rights legislation, the *Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act* in 2019, even though both gender identity and gender expression are codified as protected personal characteristics.

But it's not just the legislation that's deficient with regard to gender nonconforming people. Nearly every major pro-LGBTQ organization has failed to openly acknowledge that ""gender expression"" is covered by the Equality Act, citing exclusively ""sexual orientation and gender identity"":

I feel like there's this expectation that, as an AFAB person, I need to perform a certain level of masculinity/androgyny in order to be viewed as ""truly"" nonbinary because my facial features, voice, body shape, etc. are already ""feminine"". And the opposite seems to be true for AMAB people.  I see a lot of AMAB enbies who have long hair and wear makeup and dresses and it reads as androgynous because it's often paired with natural ""masculine"" features, like a deep voice, flat chest, facial hair, etc. I like playing with makeup, wearing long flowy skirts, and having feminine, chin-length hair and those things don't give me dysphoria personally because I don't think of them as being ""women's things"", they're just ""*my* things"". Even if I understand that these things are feminine in our culture, I don't really see them as inherently more feminine than I feel inside. But the expectation for AFAB enbies seems to be short ""boyish"" haircuts, small to non-existent/non-visible breasts, pants and shirts, and if any makeup or jewelry is worn, it's generally a more alternative style that tends to read more androgynous. And of course I know that there are plenty of non-binary people who *don't* fit into these stereotypes and in the last few years I've seen a lot more people who present pretty typically for their assigned gender coming out as nonbinary (although it's been mostly AMAB people that I've seen.) But even though I know I can present however I want and that doesn't affect who I am inside and most NB people I've encountered have been completely accepting of all different kinds of gender expression, I still feel like I can't escape gendered expectations. The thing that gives me more dysphoria than anything else (aside from my massive tiddies) is knowing that the way I feel comfortable presenting is interpreted differently by others than the way I see it. Like my medium-short hair feels a lot less femme to me than my old, longer hairstyle and the thought have having long hair again makes me uncomfortable, but I know very few people are going to look at my hair and see anything other than a woman's haircut. So even though I'm comfortable with my hair in itself, knowing how it's viewed makes me uncomfortable which sucks, because that's something I can't do anything about (aside from not caring as much how people see me, which is something I'm working on.)

I’ve done a lot of research, I’ve even figured out the exact term for what I would be considered (agenderflux). Here’s the thing: I don’t feel queer enough.

I dress totally masculine, I’ve never had what would be considered a “gay relationship” before, and I’m not even sure I’m gay (obviously now I’m questioning that after this whole fiasco). I know identity and orientation are NOT exclusive, but I’ve just always been what would be considered straight, and I’m (fairly) certain that I’ve only ever had crushes on women.

Stereotypes are OBVIOUSLY bad. I guess it just boils down to…like I said earlier, I don’t feel queer enough.

Is this normal? Is this a thing people go through? I feel like I should keep going by he/him/his pronouns. 

Totally sorry if I said anything offensive or out of place, just trying to find my place in the world. Thanks in advance!",sludgebaby96,t2_43r6ajmm,0.93,18,11
1316,mgkdd2,2021-03-30,genderqueer,I feel no attachment to my GAAB whatsoever.,"I'm AFAB and don't feel the slightest attachment to womanhood whatsoever. I've always presented masc but I don't actually care how I'm perceived and I feel comfortable with all pronouns. I just don't want any of the expectations forced on me that comes with ""woman"". But considering patriarchy, who does?

Am I just really apathetic? Or something else entirely? Patient and kind-hearted people say it's up to me. But that just leads me to stalling with further questioning. 

Dysphoria-wise, I've never liked my breast. But that's because they're huge, inconvenient, and bring unwanted attention from people of all genders. Not to mention, I have childhood trauma from my mother basically calling me a whore and telling me what to wear just because I had large breast. 

So it's hard to tell if my dysphoria is based on gender or the very real tribulations I've faced from simply having breast. 

I also don't like the concept of coming out. I'm queer sexuality-wise too but my pursuit for sex from people of all genders doesn't really need an introduction in my opinion. Similarly, I don't think my gender does either. 

But to be fair, I come from a staunch conservative family where if queerness isn't joked about for sport, it's quite literally labeled the gateway to hell. While I've never internalized this, I do wonder if coming out would seem more organic if this wasn't the case. 

Anyways, because I don't want to be outspoken about my gender identity, or lack thereof, I'm just considered cis. And sure, it's definitely easier to ""fit in"" if people merely see me as a woman and I don't talk about how I really feel. But I don't get euphoria from being a woman or know what it is to ""feel like a woman"".",dablkscorpio,t2_pakerjj,1.0,16,5
1317,12gxjq6,2023-04-10,genderqueer,gender is weird and unknowable,"Mid-30s, AFAB, generally always considered myself cis, but definitely did some questioning of my gender identity in my late teens/ early 20s. At the same time I was also questioning my sexuality. Eventually decided at the time that I was queer/lesbian (though this word has always felt a bit off despite being afab, identifying as female and only interested in women)/demisexual/grey ace. On the never side, I still identified as female but was just uncomfortable with societal gender expectations/women's traditional gender roles rather than being female in and of itself. In some ways came out of that questioning phase more comfortable with being female (or perhaps rather presenting with any real amount of femininity) than ever before. 
Definitely am more masculine than the average cis woman, but not masculine enough to come across as androgynous or butch.
I'm most comfortable in clothes that downplay aspects of my physical sex: compression sports bras, men's jeans, men's/unisex t-shirts.
I don't feel right in men's dress/ businesses casual clothes, but maybe because they don't seem to fit/look right, despite me mercifully being mostly shaped like a teenage boy. I still love my hair long. 

I recently started to re-examine my gender identity again. I don't really have gender dysphoria, but the label ""woman"" has never really felt right. ""Man"" would feel even more wrong, though. 
I don't know if agender is right, because I at once feel like I both do and do not have a gender. 
Doing and succeeding at things that are traditionally perceived as masculine make me feel good. On the rare occasions where I want to be perceived as traditionally feminine and do so, that also feels good. In most situations, being perceived as androgynous or genderless feels like it would be ideal. 

In most ways, I'm ok with this whole state of things being a bit of an enigma even to me. I don't really even know what the point of this post is. Maybe just to put this mess of thoughts out there in the universe and set them free. If others feel like this makes sense or relate to it, feel free to say so.

He's only ever identified as such, never questioned it at all. We've been together 7 years as of next month, and I came out as NB almost 2 years ago. He's supportive and happy for me, though suffers some cognitive dissonance on my male presenting days. If, as it is for him, your identified sexuality is based more upon biological equipment than presentation could a heteronormative man being with an AFAB NB still be classed as heteronormativity? 

Is it wrong for me to be angry at those that try to force him into the bisexual box simply because I don't conform to or identify as a binary gender? Why is it that the sexualities of LGBTQIA+ people are allowed a certain amount of fluidity, yet -any- even slight fluctuation (even if it's only temporarily or experimentally) on the part of a person who identifies as heteronormative, confiscates that label from them?

Surely, because I am the only NB person he has been with and it's the exception as opposed to the rule, he can't be gatekept out of the hetero box?

2. While watching porn, he takes on the role of the woman in straight porn and generally puts himself in the submissive/receiver role in any porn

1322,8phof6,2018-06-08,genderqueer,"I thought I was cis, but I don't know the difference between gnc cis and genderqueer","Hello, I'm currently really confused about gender. I keep on going back and forth between ""I'm cis"" and ""Wait, but why isn't *everyone* genderqueer?""! I was wondering if the community on here could therefore clear a few things up for me.

I'm AFAB, and the main thing that got me wondering about gender was that I really wanted a flat chest. This made me wonder a bit since I *also* have anorexia, and the way in which I view my body is undoubtedly affected by it, so I'm not sure if it's just a product of my ED and shouldn't have anything to do with gender identity. However, I do remember feeling disappointed when I got breast development, or something, and that was before my eating disorder.

I don't have any discomfort about the other parts of my body, I guess, if only partially due to the fact that I lost weight due to an eating disorder and that it's ""easier"" to look androgynous at a thinner weight. I don't care about my periods since for me it is more of a medical thing to me. I never really understood it as ""it's part of being a woman"" or something and always thought the statement to be rather comical—like, why should I care about being a ""woman"" or something. I don't feel bad about my genitals at *all*—like, I prefer having a vulva and vagina to a penis and testicles.

I'm actually quite feminine in terms of personality. I don't like sports, and I like cute things. I like feminine clothing like dresses and leggings. Clearly, these things don't determine my gender identity since they're just personality. However, they're probably the main things that keep me using she/her and identifying as female/a girl—the fact that I am AFAB and it'd be useful in a medical sense and the fact that the places specific to my interests such as r/femalefashionadvice are mainly populated by women and girls.

To be honest, I'm not even sure what the difference is between being nonbinary/genderqueer and being cis since I don't think that most people really think about their gender identities—clearly, not everyone's genderqueer/NB. I guess for me, I don't feel comfortable being included in ""the girls"" or ""the guys""—but it might just be because of sexism, like the fact that I don't want to be part of any gendered group due to the stereotypes.

To be honest, I (and I hesitate to link these articles since they're controversial) don't know how to resolve certain mental conflicts. I think I've read this argument that nonbinary can't exist innately, like it's just a political label since all NB people tend to be leftist, or something. Or that it's just a fad. I'm definitely not saying that I'm agreeing, but I'm just not sure how to mentally process this. -_-;;

1328,5mms6s,2017-01-07,genderqueer,(Invisible) Effects or Functions of Gendered Clothing or Presentation - Help me Learn - Can you share some examples too?,"Hello!  I am AMAB and after years of living as male and mostly wearing men's clothing, over the past few years have explored mixing up my gender presentation to where I now have a pretty switchy wardrobe.  The experience has been eye-opening.

One of the things that surprised me was how many ""invisible"" aspects of gender there were, where like, when I started wearing clothing from tho women's section, even casual clothing that is not immediately consciously identifiable to others as ""women's clothing"", it changed certain ways that people interacted with me.  Some things I noticed were:

* Men's clothing makes me seem like I take up more space, it makes me look bulkier, and women's clothing is more likely to be form-fitting, thus making me look smaller.  I have noticed that when wearing women's clothing, even stuff that doesn't overtly look like ""women's clothing"", people are less likely to step out of the way for me on the sidewalk, perhaps because I take up less space in people's visual field.
* Women's clothing is often finer-textured and softer to the touch.  A lot of it feels nicer against my skin and I find that comforting, but I've also noticed that some of the soft textures on external surfaces of clothing induce people to touch me more or make people respond more positively when I hug them or are close to them, sort of like ""Oh wow your sweater is so soft!!!"" as someone starts stroking my arm.
* A lot of women's shoes are thinner-soled and more minimally structured, whereas men's are bulkier and have thicker soles and more padding and support. Wearing women's shoes, besides making me seem a bit shorter, makes me more mindful of my environment and changes my gait, tending to make me take smaller, more careful steps and reducing the power of my gait, but I think in some ways it has been good for my balance and agility, easier on my feet and joints.  I wonder if this is related to how some men seem a little more casual or careless in their use of physical space, i.e. their footwear allows or enables them to be so?
* Women's clothing is more diverse and tends to be more attention-getting visually.  It thus seems to lead to people commenting (positively or negatively) on the colors, patterns, or textures of what I'm wearing.  Like, I get a lot more comments of people liking my color scheme or noticing that I matched colors when wearing women's clothing than when wearing men's clothing, even if I was equally conscious or mindful about trying to match or color-coordinate when wearing the men's clothing.
* Women's clothing tends to draw more attention to my body, both showing off more skin and also being more form-fitting and showing off my shape more, leading me to get more comments on my body when I wear it, whereas men's clothing tends to hide and conceal my body, thus reducing the amount of comments I get on it.  People definitely ""check me out"" more when wearing women's clothing, and I get more comments on my legs, butt, etc.

Becoming aware of these things has been really empowering because when I see the form-function relationships with these things, I can then sometimes pick clothing in ways that changes people's behavior in ways that I want or feel more comfortable with.  It also has made me more directly aware of sexism, including both ways in which women are objectified more or discriminated against, and ways in which men can be discriminated against (like how men are perceived as more imposing or threatening, independently of their behavior, which for example relates to the shape / structure of their clothing making them look more bulky).

I suspect there are a ton more things though that I'm not consciously aware of yet.

I'd be curious to hear if anyone has any more examples of form-function relationships in gendered presentation, and also, if people have had experience that resonate with (or are different from) what I've shared here.  I am fascinated by gender, like my experience over the past couple years has hugely opened my eyes to a bunch of stuff that was previously invisible.  And I also want to learn more...I feel like I only ever participated in a certain slice or subset of masculine self-expression, and similarly, have only explored a small subset of feminine self-expression, so I'd be curious to hear if there are other aspects of it that I haven't experienced directly and are still ""invisible"" to me.",cazort2,t2_4gpcz,0.97,38,14

Recently I'm trying to fully understand the definition of ""trans"" because I'm pretty sure 85% I'm a trans girl (AMAB) or at least a non-binary (demigirl). But after all my hopes of non being seeing as a ""man"" [linked with its social roles] I'm sure I'm not cis.

But I don't know, basing on genderdysphoria.fyi's definition of transgender with ""Denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their sex assigned at birth"", if I don't correspond with my sex assigned at birth.

How do I know if I correspond with my AGAB? Via dysphoria?
If so I hate my hairy body, but liking/doesn't really mind my voice, wish I could try to have some breast because since a week when I cross dressed with some bras I felt an inner peace and euphoria [and dysphoria with the tiny chest hair]. And I am growing my hair. Also I am envious of women body and their appearances.

From what I learnt I can be a woman if I identify as one but I am little scared of it because I don't know if I'll be able to be woman.
I'm pretty sure I don't want to raise like a man; and at the same time I desire to be a girl [it excite me enough the idea of being a wonderful girl] and being considered like one. In fact I think I have social dysphoria when people [ :') I hate people ] refer me with male pronouns, because of this I love and use in my mind ""she/her"" pronouns {in my native language, Italian, we unfortunately don't have the possibility to express gender neutrality like the ""I am"", very sad}

But it feels like every time I see even a limited example of a genderqueer actor or person on a blog, they have the same body type: slim and androgynous. 

But as much as I might wish otherwise, my body doesn't look like that. I have enormous hips and breasts and a fairly soft face. No one, not even on my most male presenting days, has ever had any doubts about what gender I was assigned at birth.

I feel like there's this weird pressure for how genderqueer people are supposed to present. If you're AMAB and nonbinary, you're supposed to be flamboyant and wear makeup. If you're AFAB and nonbinary, you're supposed to present completely masculinely. Maybe that's just a personal pressure, but I feel it a lot. And I like presenting as masculine, but I consider myself male and female, and I like dresses and lipstick as well as suits and short hair. I would ideally like to be understood as a man and woman no matter what I wear. 

Not to mention how hard ""male"" clothes that even fit me are to find; or how humiliating it is to walk into a dressing room with 50 items of clothing from the men's section and not be able to squeeze into a single one without drawing even more attention to how misshaped my body is for a guy's. 

I guess I just feel like because of my body and gender presentation (masculine AND feminine) I can never be seen as anything but a woman.

I think it would still be nice for my peace of mind and to express that I feel somewhat genderqueer although I don’t feel like I need to “change” genders, moreso that I just don’t feel the need to only be identified as a woman. I just be a person who is generally more feminine although really 90% of the time I just wear sweatpants and tshirts so I guess I’m more in the middle in that way lmao but I have long-ish purple hair so that’s pretty much always femme. 

But I’m not like a lot of people who say they’ve never really felt like their assigned gender was right. I feel like gender is just a social construct and I’m just kinda swimming around in it. But to that point sometimes I’m like okay then you’re a woman who dresses masc and femme, you don’t have to be like oh I’m NB cuz you are comfortable with she/her pronouns. But I think I’d be comfortable with any pronouns. I honestly think that the world would be better if gender wasn’t a thing and we all used the same pronouns. I wish that was the world I lived in. But that’s not gonna be a thing any time soon if ever and the reality is being genderqueer is under attack rn and it will probably be a long time before majority of the world accepts it as normal. 

I’m already in a queer relationship (WLW). In my head I’m like do I really need to add another thing that makes me be seen as weird or different when I feel content as I am. Or I guess maybe I don’t feel totally content since I’m writing this but I feel like I can deal. And a lot of the times I’ll be like “well just because you dress masc sometimes doesn’t mean you’re not a woman. So why change anything?? Women can wear whatever they want and still be women!” 

Idk gender is just complicated and I wish it was simple. In my head I’m like yeah it’s simple you are a woman but you wear whatever you want and that’s totally okay. I wish we all used a neutral pronoun, but also I don’t think just using they/them pronouns feels right to me (I know that sounds contradictory but if everyone did it would just feel natural). I don’t want to use a neo pronoun cuz that just feels too unnatural to my brain. This might sound dumb but I think the fact that they/them pronouns are traditionally plural makes them sound sorta weird in my brain (please don’t yell at me for this I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with using they/them it’s just not something I’m used to because obv it’s not super common and I only know a few enbies and I only interact with one on a regular basis).  And I use they/them all the time when I’m just saying a person in general (rather than he/she which is “grammatically correct” but when I apply it to a specific person it seems a little unnatural in my brain?? Maybe it’s an autistic thing. Just not used to it but that’s just my brain. I still use the correct pronouns for ppl and I don’t mess up much—at least not as much as people around me seem to.) Anyways. 

This has gotten off topic. Idk what to do if anything. Maybe I’m just an NB in denial. But I also have an attachment to womanhood cuz that’s what I’ve been and felt like my whole life so far (I’ll be 23 soon). But I also want to be free from gender. But my whole life has been affected by womanhood because of society, misogyny, social norms, etc and that feels important to who I am. I guess they aren’t mutually exclusive. I just feel like I don’t fit anywhere exactly. Majority of the differences between men and women are nurture, not nature, cuz society raises boys and girls in specific ways depending on sex. Which is stupid! But society changes slowly. Which is annoying. 

Thinking back on it I was a tomboy and was always trying so hard to not be a “girly girl” as a kid but I think that was internalized misogyny. Then I went through a girly phase when I realized there was nothing wrong with that. Now I’m at this in between where sometimes I wanna dress girly but most of the time I wanna be in between but I guess femme leaning and sometimes I wanna be masc. I also feel weird differing from what I’ve defined as my “style” cuz I feel like people see me weird when I do dress girlier cuz they are used to seeing me be more in between or more chill girl style. Why am I putting myself in a dang box…?",soopercool-username,t2_3z5zw72go,0.85,12,11
1336,3lwdl1,2015-09-22,genderqueer,"(xpost from r/genderfluid) Bandwagon-jumping, Childhood based dysphoria, or Genderfluid?","[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderfluid/comments/3ltu6o/bandwagonjumping_childhood_shaped_dysphoria_or/) **I didn't really get much feed back on this and I still want to know from the people who are already living this. Please share your opinions, good or bad. I'm not looking for a definitive answer, I just want to know if anyone feels like I do. I'm still trying to figure this out and I don't know very much, so please feel free to educate. Thank you. <3**

So I'm going to try and keep this short (ETA, NOT SHORT), but I've been questioning my gender identity for a few months now. I'm AFAB, 19 and Bisexual. I volunteer at a LGBTQA+ community and have been exposed to so many different kinds of people and it's helped me learn a lot about myself, but I have yet to bring this up with my GF/GQ friends for fear of offending them. Being in this community also makes me worry I'm just jumping on a bandwagon and trying to be ""trendy"". Help.

I dress fairly androgynously, though with 32C's, shoulder length hair and other feminine features, most people just call me a tomboy and I leave it at that. It's not that I don't like womens clothes, I've never tried to bind (I like my girls), it's just that I feel more comfortable wearing neutral clothing. I only wear dresses to formal events, any other day it's jeans/shorts/sometimes skirts and a t-shirt. I despise low cut tops, but mens shirts are hard for me to fit into without altering (have to buy large and tailor small for chest and shoulder reasons) so I mainly just buy neutral girls clothes. I bought my first pair of guys jeans the other week and am waiting for it to be cool enough outside to wear them, but I wear them in private and they make me happy. I also have a few pairs of boxers that I wear when lounging around the house (the loose fit is comfortable, but I prefer girls panties when actually getting ready for the day because boxers get scrunched up in fitted jeans) and I love them. I've thought of cutting my hair short to better fit my personality, but I'm also really attached to the curls and refuse to chop more off than I have to. In short, I'm fairly noticeably female and have no desire to change my body to conform to an androgynous lifestyle, but because of this, everything I wear looks feminine, or at best tomboy. This discrepancy is one of the #1 reasons I question my identity. Am I just a female who likes dressing a certain way, or am I genderfluid who doesn't want to change their body to conform with a stereotype?

Now to my childhood bit. I'll say it now, me being a girl was a big problem. My father was out of my life by 7, and dead by 9. I was a daddys girl, but that stopped at a really young age. My mother grew up in an abusive household where her brother was more valued for being a boy and she was disposable because she was a girl. She carried this attitude on, along with the abuse, to my childhood. My brother was adored, my sister took an incredible amount of verbal abuse. Dad did nothing to stop it. When they moved out when I was 5, I was the next plaything. My little girl cuteness only saved me from so much, and I was only allowed to be female while my dad was still around. When my mother and I lived alone, any behavior that my mother didn't like was strongly rebuked verbally and physically. I learned to behave as she wanted me to, which included a lot of stereotypical male behavior. I didn't voluntarily wear a dress from 7 to 18 ( I say voluntarily because she would literally make me wear dresses in public as punishment and at 15 she bought handfuls of dresses that I feigned interest in because I knew anything else would get me beat) I now own four dresses that I really like, but it still takes a lot for me to wear them. I'm warming up to skirts, but they have to be knee length and loose.

But anyway, childhood. I had two step-nephews close to my age. One was 6 years older, one a year younger and I grew up with them as if they were brothers. The oldest was very macho, the youngest was more feminine. The eldest protected me, I protected the youngest. I would wear their clothes, rough-house with them and played sports with them. I remember one easter wearing a guys button-up and corduroy pants. I grew thinking I was one of the guys and this was in turn re-enforced through my mother. Basically, I was a substitute-guy for the majority of my childhood. That changed at puberty. Then, my mother tried to make me female and I really had no choice in the matter. I wore more feminine clothes in public and was made to wear makeup and ill-fitting bras. I was also repeatedly told being a girl was still a very bad thing and that I would be raped by every man I met. I'm still working through this. I learned to fear and despise being a woman in an entirely new and different way. I was taken out of school at ten so I never got to explore my sexuality except through romance books and porn which were all very hetero-normative. It wasn't until seeing a bisexual character in a tv show at 15 that I was finally able to pinpoint why I liked both genders and that it was ok. Of course, telling my mother brought on more abuse and I never got to actually date outside of the man I would currently be engaged to if it werent for our long-distance situation. Basically, I was locked up and abused for my entire life until I ran away at 18 and found my community where I actually was able to learn about myself and find out that it was ok being different. I am still working through the misogyny I grew up with, but I know what was done was wrong and that being female is ok. And yet, I still am more comfortable being masculine and largely reject feminine things...except for that part of that actually really likes being feminine and fuck it's confusing.

Like, I sometimes like to dress up, but it takes a lot of courage. I know part of this is the dysphoria I was forced to grow up with, but I am also trying to accept where I am now and that is that I actually like being able to be either male or female depending on my mood. My boyfriend says dating me is basically dating a guy in a womans body and he loves my male and female sides equally. He encourages it actually and was the one to coax me to buying a pair of guys jeans. He's a very strange man, but in a good way. Very supportive.

This went way longer than I thought it would, but it's helped. I feel less scared and more certain, but I still have my reservations. I guess I'm still trying to figure out if this just makes me a female with non-stereotypical behavior, a special snowflake, or an honest Genderfluid with issues. Can anyone here help me figure this out? ",Cranksta,t2_lf11h,0.67,2,1

I've been thinking a lot about these two throughout my youth and as a trans guy I'm interested in your opinion:
My attraction to women was confusing me as I was busy figuring out whether I was a butch lesbian, non-binary, transmasculine or a transman. The reason is, being AFAB and into women, I was wondering how both could make sense at the same time. Considering that I had the same bodyshape and bodyparts as women (generally speaking), why would it make me so gender-dysphoric and body-dysmorphic when I find other women with those same features so attractive and it's what I desire in a wife as a (future) partner?

1338,727c04,2017-09-24,genderqueer,Not really sure what the fuck to think of myself (fucking labels),"So, I am a (probably, fuck I don't really know) cis-hetero guy, or at least mostly. I think, maybe? Jesus is this supposed to be so hard? I grew up in a rural area of a bible belt state and back then it was easier, I knew I felt attracted to women, I was assigned male at birth and that all seemed pretty legit. I had would I would identify as pretty normal adolescent oh shit am I gay moments and some odd experimenting here and there. But in the end, I am very confident I don't really have any sexual feeling for dudes or at least penises. I can totally wrap my head around the idea of romantic love with a man, but not sex, just doesn't appeal in the same way that a woman does. So that's easy I guess. And back when I was young it was all pretty black and white, or I guess more precisely pink and blue, and I felt more blue than pink and that seemed good enough. But then and even more now, I realize that maybe it's more like 25-30% female and 75-70$ male. So fuck, what the hell does that mean, is it just that I am a male in a traditionally female profession, surrounded by women and always the out-group, is it I don't want to identify as the oppressor? I had some minor sexual abuse as a kid (female teacher, not that horrible in the grand scheme of things) Is this all just the result of too many labels? Is this how every guy feels and I just don't know it? I don't think so, I don't have any male friends who have ever mentioned something like this. Anyway, anyone have any ideas? Seriously, I am a nurse, I have worked with lots of trans patients, I know for a fact I dont have the anguish most of them have gone through, I dont want to take away from someone else experience or equate my discomfort with someone elses. I just wish I could be both, like mostly male and a little female (lets ignore all the societal stuff that would make that nearly impossible) most of the time I am pretty happy being a guy, I dont really meet the stereotype, but that's cool. But shit, sometimes I just feel like things don't match like I am on the outside of my own group looking in.

[For example:](https://np.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/6ssal7/is_anyone_else_coming_close_to_exhaustion_about/dlfd8rb/)

>  It's the same brain-sex arguments, the same ""dresses are for girls, trucks are for boys"" rules, the same desperate social push to ""fix"" anybody who won't conform to gender

Hell, it's [their sidebar image](http://i.imgur.com/LErTOyq.png). It's no secret that this is what they believe we believe.

It's also no secret that this isn't actually what we believe: brain sex means ""the brain's map of the body expects this body part to be here and gets distressed if that's not the case"", not ""your personality conforms to whatever Victorian patriarchs said it should"". But you already know that, and TERFs have chosen not to know it, so I'm just preaching to the choir on that one. I'm just establishing a baseline for context here.

What I find interesting is their reaction to the [""Google Manifesto""](http://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320), a screed shared company-wide by a Google employee that recently came to light. It buries its lede among a lot of hand-wringing about how everyone is too intolerant of their ""diversity of opinions"", but here's one of his core arguments:

> On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways. These differences aren’t just socially constructed because:

> * They’re universal across human cultures

> * They’re exactly what we would predict from an evolutionary psychology perspective

> Women, on average, have more:

> * Openness directed towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas. Women generally also have a stronger interest in people rather than things, relative to men (also interpreted as empathizing vs. systemizing).

> * These two differences in part explain why women relatively prefer jobs in social or artistic areas. More men may like coding because it requires systemizing and even within SWEs, comparatively more women work on front end, which deals with both people and aesthetics.

In other words: he claims that women are less suited to mathematical, technical work than men are, and this is due to their underlying biology, not due to socialization or cultural influences. Put more succinctly: ""lol girls are bad at math"".

I don't want to spend too much time on the other problems with the manifesto. I could go on about how his claim that the gender pay gap disappears when you control for the job held is empirically false; that it contradicts his claim that actually the gender pay gap is real, but only because women are bad at salary negotiation; that even if that were true, it would say more about how employers perceive women in the workplace, not about the employees themselves; that he seems to think doing anything at all to increase diversity is going too far and is discriminating against white men; and that his assertion buried in a footnote that diversity is an elitist Marxist plot is insane alt-right bullshit. There's too much awful about the manifesto to go into, and plenty has been written elsewhere about how [""I can't tell my coworkers they're biologically unsuited to their jobs"" is not an unsafe work environment for you, but ""I tell my coworkers that they're biologically unsuited to their jobs"" is a textbook unsafe work environment for them.](https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/so-about-this-googlers-manifesto-1e3773ed1788)

Instead, what I want to talk about is the TERF reaction to this manifesto. After all, this guy is basically the bogeyman they believe we are. He's straight-up saying that women are biologically unsuited to technical work; for people who get so mad at us just because they pretend we say that, they must really hate this guy for actually saying it. Right?

Well, in some threads they do. But in others...

One thread explains via a conservative article that [the true intolerant one here is Google for being intolerant of intolerance](https://np.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/6sgbjg/google_cant_seem_to_tolerate_diversity/dlci0u8/), while another uses this as an excuse to [make libfem transcultists the villain somehow](https://np.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/6sok62/you_know_what_the_funniest_thing_about_the_google/). In the most open and shut case of a misogynist alt-right guy insulting his coworkers, they still can't consistently put their finger on the problem.

But to me, the most striking is [the most recent thread:](https://np.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/6stcxw/im_tired_of_feminists_trying_to_make_me_a_man/)

>  i read this article on the google memo issue http://slate.me/2vFO7Ht. The first line particularly bothered me, ""t’s 2017, and people are still debating whether or not women are intellectually inferior to men"" I read the entire memo and it never said this. All is says to me are women and mean are different, we are more the same than different. It is this author who is applying the ""inferior"" to female biological traits. WHY DO WE DO THIS?!?!!? Men and women both have good and bad aspects to them, neither is inferior.

I wanted to highlight a very particular paragraph from JK's essay that I personally haven't seen much hubbub over.  This is specifically the few sentences she wrote talking about her MS charitable funding, how the disease behaves differently in men than in women, and implying that ""eroding the legal definition of sex"" would somehow, I don't know, make people stop treating women for MS? Or something? It's unclear what conclusion the fear-mongering is trying to get you to draw, but rest assured, it's terrifying and will hurt cis women, specifically. 

But keeping the ""legal definition of sex"" how it is now doesn't accomplish what she thinks it does. Yes, the history of medical research has been and currently is sexist (and racist and ableist, etc), but pointing out that a disease or treatment exhibits differently in men and women is not and should never be the end of a scientific discussion.

Does MS affect women and men differently based on the presence or lack of a womb? Almost certainly not. Chromosomes? There's a possibility, though if that's the case doctors be doing chromosome tests to ensure that every patient, including intersex patients, are given the study and treatment needed. 

The most likely reason why any disease or treatment affect men and women differently is a combination of factors, the majority of which are caused by hormone levels. And guess what, JK? Some trans people have hormone levels more consistent with their gender identity than with their chromosomes, and some cis people have the opposite situation. 

The prejudice and discrimination existent in the medical industry is not solved by a binary legal definition of male and female. It's solved by recognizing the variation of biology between individuals and some amount of pattern recognition. What if the difference in effects between men in women is due to hormone levels? Then trans women on HRT should be given the same treatment as cis women with average female hormone levels, and cis and intersex women with atypical hormone levels should be given special attention to accommodate their different needs. What if the difference is due to red blood cell count, or bone density, or even fucking shoulder-to-hip ratio? Then each patient should be individually examined and treated based on their own personal results, because treating male and female groups as monoliths when it comes to differences in treatment will harm cis people whose bodies fall outside the norm, and trans people who have only gone through their desired puberty with HRT and therefore have the typical traits associated with their gender identity. 

If JK is truly a trans ally, she should realize that practicing medical research and treatment based on sex assigned at birth will do direct harm to trans people who have undergone HRT, and if she is truly a feminist who's interested in the proper medical treatment of cis women she should realize that it will do direct harm to any cis women whose body falls outside a binary definition of female. 

In conclusion, the erosion of our current definition of sex, which is binary and thus excludes any person, cis or trans, who falls outside of the binary, would not itself decrease the efficacy of medical treatment for cis women and girls. What might do so is sexism and misogyny, and if that were to happen, JK would have much more success fighting sexism and bias in the medical field than the civil rights of trans people - and she might even inadvertently help trans people in the process as well.",Merrymir,t2_vq1rfeh,0.91,129,14

1371,9jd3wb,2018-09-27,GenderCynical,[Satire] Why lesbianism is misogyny,"There's been a lot of discussion in feminist circles recently about Lesbianism.  I have nothing against lesbians or other gender-nonconformers, but I've been very disturbed by the cult-like mindset where anyone who questions the homosexual dogma is called a ""homophobe"", or, worse, a ""heterosexual"".

First of all, I'd like to begin by explaining how ""heterosexual"" is a misogynistic slur.  ""heterosexual"" means someone who is attracted to very masculine, gender-conforming men.  They use this slur against women, and noticeably, only women.  It's funny how they think that normal women should be called ""heterosexual women"", while they get to be ""women"".

Second, I'd like to discuss the cultish attitude.  Whenever someone expresses concern about whether lesbian dogma is accurate, about how lesbian rights might take away the rights of women, how this ideology is being pushed on children, who are forced by gay rights activists to date other women, or how women who speak up about these questions are being attacked, threatened, and silenced, they get called a ""homophobe"" (also a misogynistic slur for women who dare to question the gay agenda).

I'm so glad to have finally found a community, /r/gendercynical, where I can finally openly discuss my concerns about lesbianism.

First, let's look into lesbian dogma.  Lesbian dogma says that women have something called a ""sexual orientation"", which is inside their heads, and which we're just expected to believe.  I've never had a sexual orientation.  I was born a woman, I'm attracted to men.  It's not something based on identity, it's something based on biology.

Some women, such as myself, are attracted to feminine men.  This used to be considered taboo in the traditional era of strong gender roles, but there's nothing wrong with it.  And being attracted to gender-nonconforming people doesn't mean that you're attracted to the same gender.  There's something deeply sexist about believing that you have an ""orientation"" towards the same gender.  Gender is just a set of roles invented by the patriarchy, and when you say you're attracted to women, you're saying that gender roles are real.  That men can't be feminine, and that women can't be masculine.  Every lesbian's idea of their ideal sexual partner is just a caricatured strawman of womanhood:  hypersexual, in a dress, covered in makeup, and wearing high-heels.  This essentialist conception of womanhood is deeply misogynistic.  And worse, they're convincing children who are attracted to gender-nonconforming men that they have to become lesbians.

So you may be wondering:  if gender doesn't really exist or mean anything, then it's ridiculous and meaningless for someone to call themselves a ""gay"", but what's the harm in it?  If sexual orientation isn't real, then why shouldn't people be allowed to date whomever they want?  The answer is biology.

Women are oppressed because they have sex with men.  If you look at it from a biological, materialist perspective, men oppress women because they want to get sex from them.  The idea that men could have sex with men, or that women could have sex with women instead, erases this distinction, and with it the basis for women to collectively organize against male oppression.  After all, if women can identify as ""lesbians"", then the issues that affect women because of their sexual biology, such as male domestic violence, pregnancy, abortion, and sexual harassment/assault (which as we know doesn't happen to lesbians) are no longer considered ""women's issues"", and we'll lose the protections and rights we fought so hard for as the lesbians invade our spaces and replace us.

So, why is lesbianism happening?  As I've said, part of the reason is because of gender roles.  Girls who are attracted to feminine boys are told by tumblr that they're actually attracted to girls.  Another part of it is the pharmaceutical industry.  Big pharma helped spread homosexual propaganda so they can make billions of dollars a year selling AIDS medication.  Lots of lesbians just do it for the attention, since ""homosexuals"" get more privileges than real women these days.  

But finally, there's the psychological condition of autoandrophilia (AAP).  This is a very strongly researched clinical phenomenon, although you won't find it in the DSM because the APA has gotten too much pressure from the well-funded gay agenda.  Basically, AAP is a sexual paraphilia wherein women get sexually aroused by the idea of being a man, and having sex with a woman lets them live out their fantasy.  This is why lots of lesbians dress up in men's clothing.  It's part of the fetish.  ""But ntr4ctr"", you ask, ""what about the lesbians who are feminine?""  Those are femsexualhomosexuals (FSHS).  They're just women who are attracted to feminine men, who have realized that it is considered more socially acceptable to date gender-conforming women.

Thank you, /r/gendercynical, it's been good to get this off of my chest without being called a ""heterosexual"" ""homophobe"".  I'm so glad to finally be somewhere that believes in free speech, science, and women's rights.",ntr4ctr,t2_15do28,0.95,166,23

1374,hpcfe9,2020-07-11,GenderCynical,"TERFs like to use the 'high detransition' argument to invalidate trans people. Fortunatly, I have managed to compile a huge amount of data debunking this","I have seen TERFs try to say 'oh, you are just going through a phase' to a trans person, because they rely on data with very poor methodology  that hurts trans people (which I talk about towards the end). So I want  to put an end to this. I spent a good few days compiling [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KxCxhpj1CAOr8CzWow-rUeBZig6q6n49x3MPdFXhzL8/edit) document together and here is what I found (any other studies on the topic you can find would be much appriciated):

**Trans Kids Detransition**

[Using information from the Australian Court](https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/FamCAFC/2017/258.html), **96%**  of all patients who were assessed and received a diagnosis of Gender  Dysphoria by the 5th intervenor (the Royal Children's Hospital) from  2003 to 2017 continued to identify as transgender or gender diverse into  late adolescence. **No patient** who had commenced stage 2 treatment had sought to transition back to their birth assigned sex.

[A summarisation on all people treated in Amsterdam from 1972 up to 2015](https://twin.sci-hub.tw/6674/37489e60e65a27ef4a054babca221015/wiepjes2018.pdf#view=FitH) ([abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29463477/)) ,  which treats more than 95% of the transgender population in the  Netherlands, found that out of those referred to the clinic in before  the age of 18 and treated with puberty blockers, 4 out of 207 trans  girls (**2%**) stopped puberty suppression without proceeding to HRT and 2 out of 370 trans boys (**less than 1%**) stopped puberty suppression without proceeding to HRT

[A study of 143 youth receiving puberty-blocking medication in the Netherlands](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10508-020-01660-8.pdf) found that **3.5%** chose to discontinue puberty blockers without seeking any further transition treatment.

[A William's Institute report](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/age-trans-individuals-us/) finds that there is **no significant difference** between the number of trans teens and the number of trans adults (**0.7%** and **0.6%** respectively). The slight decrease in the oldest age group could be down to rejection from peers, as [older generations are much less likely to support trans rights than younger people](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Public-Opinion-Trans-US-Aug-2019.pdf).

Also, trans kids are not ‘going through a phase.’ First of all, [an article from a magazine from the American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx) mentions how that by age 4, children have ‘stable sense of their gender identity.’ And a[ study on trans and cis kids](https://scihub.wikicn.top/10.1073/pnas.1909367116) ([citied in this Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnstaceyennis/2020/12/29/study-transgender-children-recognize-their-authentic-gender-at-early-age-just-like-other-kids/#1f9d83da526b))  ([abstract](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/49/24480)) found gender identity — the concept of knowing whether one’s self is  male, female or non-binary — is as strong in trans kids as it is among  those identifying as cis. Similar results are found [in this study](http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d642/d3853a04e464d85b629115d7ff513b9da20a.pdf). A [study on brain scans of young trans people](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180524112351.htm)  found brain activity and structure in transgender adolescents more  closely resembles the typical activation patterns of their desired  gender.

**General Detransition**

[A study on detransition rates in a national UK Gender Identity Clinic](https://epath.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Boof-of-abstracts-EPATH2019.pdf#page=139) (P139) found out that of the 3398 patients who had appointments during this period, 16 (**0.47%**)  expressed transition-related regret or de-transitioned. Of these 16,  one patient expressed regret but was not considering detransitioning,  two had expressed regret and were considering detransitioning, three had  detransitioned, and ten had detransitioned temporarily.

The  reasons stated by patients for their regret or detransition included:  social factors, reporting physical complications, and changing their  mind about their gender identity and identifying as their gender  assigned at birth, which shows that of that minority, alot were not due  to releasing they are not trans

[A transgender mental health survey in the UK](https://www.gires.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/trans_mh_study.pdf) (P66-67) found in terms of social changes that they had made in relation to being trans or transitioning, only **9%** had significant regrets. In regards to the physical changes of being trans, only **2%** having major regrets. Remember that regrets =/= detransition though

[A massive survey of trans people in the United States](https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Full-Report-Dec17.pdf) (P111) found that even including people who only temporarily detransition either socially or medical (or both), only **8%** of respondents reported having de-transitioned at some point.

Of these “detransitioners,” only **5%** did it because they realized it was not for them, accounting for a mere **0.4%** of the overall sample.

And even then, **62%**  of those who had de-transitioned reported that they were currently  living full time in a gender different than the gender they were thought  to be at birth.

*“The  2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS) is the largest survey examining the  experiences of transgender people in the United States, with 27,715  respondents from all fifty states, the District of Columbia, American  Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and U.S. military bases overseas”*

**Sex Reassigment Surgery Detransition**

[A study on people who went through sex reassignment surgery in the Netherlands](https://scihub.wikicn.top/10.1017/s0033291704002776)  ([abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15842032/)) found that of 162 trans adults, only 1 reported they would choose not  to transition again. Another had some regrets but would choose to  transition again (**0.6%** regret rate)

[An analysis of all applications for sex reassignment surgery in Sweden](https://scihub.wikicn.top/10.1007/s10508-014-0300-8)  ([abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24872188/)) found that of people undergoing SRS, regret was about **2.2%** and there was a significant decline of regret over time

[In this international survey of 46 surgeons](https://journals.lww.com/prsgo/Fulltext/2018/08001/Abstract__A_Survey_Study_of_Surgeons__Experience.266.aspx)  (67% of providers have been in practice for greater than 10 years) they  were asked to select a range representing the number of transgender  patients they have surgically treated, and this amounted to a cumulative  number of approximately 22,725 patients treated by the cohort.

49%  of respondents had never encountered a patient who regretted their  gender transition or were seeking detransition care. 12 providers  encountered 1 patient with regret and the rest encountered more than one  patient. This amounted to a total of 62 patients. There were 13  patients who regretted chest surgery and 45 patients who regretted  genital surgery.

Overall, only **22** patients (**0.1%** of the sample) detransitioned because of a change in gender identity

[A study on 232 trans women who were operated by the same surgeon 'using a consistent technique'](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024086814364#page-1) found that **none**  reported outright regret and only a few expressed even occasional  regret. Dissatisfaction was most strongly associated with unsatisfactory  physical and functional results of surgery.

[An international study on people who had SRS](https://scihub.wikicn.top/10.1080/0092623x.2017.1326190) ([abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471328/)) found that postoperative satisfaction was **94% to 100%,** depending on the type of surgery performed. Only eight (**6%**) of the participants reported dissatisfaction and/or regret.

[A study in Belgium of people who underwent SRS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1158136006000491?via%3Dihub) found **none** of the patients regretted their surgery.

[A study of 218 patients in Sweden](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9570489/) found only **3.8%** had regretted it. The study also notes that support from family and friends is a huge factor in reducing regret.

[A study on 66 patients](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11564029/) found **none** of the present patients claimed to regret their decision to undergo gender-transforming surgery.

[A meta analysis of studies](https://web.archive.org/web/20070812100135/http://www.symposion.com:80/ijt/pfaefflin/6002-6.htm#Treatment%20Results) found 20 MTF and 5 FTM regretted transitioning due to gender identity. According to [this study that mentions this](http://www.amsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CareOfThePatientUndergoingSRS.pdf) (P4), there were 1000-1600 MTF and 400-550 FTM patients, which equates to regret rates of <1% for FTMs and 1-1.5% for MTFs

Ultimately,  detransition is much rarer than a lot of people say, and even then, a  big chunk of people (probably most) who regret transition/detransition  do not do it due to a realization that they are not trans. And again, a  big chunk of those who detransitioned only do so temporarily.

**So what is wrong with previous studies?**

I will be talking about the studies on trans kids, which are the most quoted I have seen. One recent example of quotation is in [JK Rowling's essay](https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/):

“*I  want to be very clear here: I know transition will be a solution for  some gender dysphoric people, although I’m also aware through extensive  research that studies have consistently shown that between 60-90% of  gender dysphoric teens will grow out of their dysphoria.”*

But there a number of flaws with these studies:

[An analysis of 3 of these studies found this](https://zero.sci-hub.tw/4911/9dc0c58006960fe1220b267bafa48e53/olson2016.pdf#view=FitH) (I'm quoting, and it's a long quote):

*“The  3 largest and most-cited studies have reported on the adolescent or  adult gender identities of cohorts who had, in childhood, showed gender  “atypical” patterns of behavior. Of those who could be followed up, a  minority were transgender:* ***1*** *of 44,* ***9*** *of 45, and* ***21*** *of  54. Most of the remaining children later identified as gay, lesbian, or  bisexual (although a small number also was heterosexual).*

*However,  close inspection of these studies suggests that most children in these  studies were not transgender to begin with. In 2 studies, a large  minority (40 and 25) of the children did not meet the criteria for GID  to start with, suggesting they were not transgender (because transgender  children would meet the criteria). Further, even those who met  the GID diagnostic criteria were rarely transgender. Binary transgender  children (the focus of this discussion) insist that they are the  “opposite” sex, but most children with GID/GD do not. In fact, the  DSM-III-R directly stated that true insistence by a boy that he is a  girl occurs “rarely” even in those meeting that criterion, a point  others have made. When directly asked what their gender is, more than  90% of children with GID in these clinics reported an answer that  aligned with their natal sex, the clearest evidence that most did not  see themselves as transgender.*

*We  know less about the identities of the children in the third study, but  the recruitment letters specifically requested boys who made “statements  of wanting to be a girl” (p. 12), with no mention of insisting they  were girls. Barring evidence that the children in these studies were  claiming an “opposite” gender identity in childhood, these studies are  agnostic about the persistence of an “opposite” gender identity into  adulthood.* ***Instead,  they show that most children who behave in gender counter-stereotypic  ways in childhood are not likely to be transgender adults.****”*

[This analysis of 4 of these studies](https://scihub.wikicn.top/10.1080/15532739.2018.1456390)  found methodological, theoretical, ethical, and interpretive concerns  regarding four “desistance” studies are presented. Here is their  breakdown:

*Methodological Concerns*

1. the potential misclassification of child research participants
2. the lack of acknowledgement of social context for research participants
3. the age of participants at follow-up
4. the potential misclassification of adolescent and young adult participants lost to follow-up

*Theoretical Concerns*

1. assumptions inherent in“desistance”terminology
2. binary gender framework
3. presumption of gender stability as a positive outcome

*Ethical Concerns*

1. intensive treatment and testing of child participants
2. questionable goals of treatment
3. lack of consideration of children’s autonomy

*Interpretive Concerns*

1. the assumption that unknown future adult needs should supersede known childhood needs
2. the underestimation of harm when attempting to delay or defer transition

Here are the conclusions from [this presentation from a WPATH conference](https://gidreform.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/methodological-questions-in-childhood-gender-identity-desistence-research/) (which is a [reputable organization on gender dysphoria](https://www.hrc.org/resources/world-professional-association-for-transgender-health-wpath)), which criticizes some of those studies:

1. Evidence  from these studies suggests that the majority of gender nonconforming  children are not gender dysphoric adolescents or adults.
2. It  does not support the stereotype that most children who are actually  gender dysphoric will “desist” in their gender identities before  adolescence.
3. These  studies do acknowledge that intense anatomic dysphoria in childhood may  be associated with persistent gender dysphoria and persistent gender  identity through adolescence.
4. Speculation  that allowing childhood social transition traps cisgender youth in  roles that are incongruent with their identities is not supported by  evidence.
5. These  studies fail to examine the diagnostic value of Real Life Experience in  congruent gender roles for gender dysphoric children.

***I'll  also leave some news articles that you can look at about those poor  studies and this topic in general for further reading (most reference  some of the studies I have talked about):***

**Why am I talking about this?**

Trans people are one of the most oppressed groups in society today. [An EU survey](https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/eu-lgbt-survey-results-at-a-glance_en.pdf) found that **46%** felt discriminated against or harassed within the past year for being trans, **29%** felt discriminated against when it came to looking for employment, **70%** hid being trans during schooling before becoming 18 years old, and **55%** had an incident of violence within the past year in part or whole because of them being trans. [A Stonewall UK survey](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/system/files/lgbt_in_britain_-_trans_report_final.pdf) found similar results.

Because  of this, this contributes to a whole host of mental health issues.  Suicide attempt rates in trans people are thought to be anywhere [from **32% to 50%**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5178031/). And this kind of misinformation is a key factor in this discrimination and ultimatly these huge mental health problems.

Debunking  this kind of misinformation and accepting trans people for who they are  can really make a difference. One of the key factors in a trans  person’s mental welbeing is family support, with family rejection [being tied to drug use, suicide, and other things](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/lgbt.2015.0111).  But family acceptance (which includes acceptance of gender identity)  has huge benefits for a trans person.

Camus was right. God is dead and we have teabagged him, Fs in the chat. In terms of optics, it's not good for Ovarit someone posted this. I feel like they could have gotten away with (baselessly) claiming this was a troll. Maybe the mods haven't seen it yet, I don't know. 

What's interesting is how willing the other users were to comforting them. I mean, I'm glad they didn't try to bully this GC into losing their job by creating a hostile working environment. Whatever their personal opinion is, personally I'd settle for people just feeling less willing to be assholes about it in mundane circunstances. As a trans person myself, I've had some disagreement with other trans people who cause a fuss over any kind of misgendering in any circumstance. But credit where credit is due, the bullying works clearly. I'm glad this trans coworker didn't need to deal with a new hire being a shit over nothing and this GC can hopefully maintain some barebones professionalism long enough the only one making a big deal out of it is them. They brushed up against rationality there for a second, and I want to believe people like this can learn to chill. 

This is something that always just drives me insane about transphobes personally. Like, you don't want to show me any respect? Fine, I'm confident enough in my own masculinity at this point, I don't need the validation. But I don't want to be around you, and I don't want to deal with the cringe and humiliation you're putting us both through. If someone misgendered me at work *intentionally*, I wouldn't report them to HR because it hurt my feelings, I'd report them because they're causing tension over nothing. I didn't do anything, *they did.* I just don't want to be involved in your little issues, leave me *out of it.* What do they *expect from us* other than just vanish?

I am a cis woman, but my path to even that identity was complicated by being autistic, as well as queer. Growing up I had female ""friends"" but was always kind of treated like a freak by other girls, one best friend yelled at me ""you're not a normal girl"" and that I shouldn't give advice to my male friends re their GFs because I'd cause problems for those women. I've also encountered endless problems from female doctors and psychologists, where they hurt me instead of helping me. 

Over a decade ago I found myself on early YouTube engaging with trans women. I identified with them because I also felt society and biology had put up a huge barrier between me and my womanhood/femininity. I have made several good friends in this community over the years. Trans ways of thinking and being have offered me the only way really to understand my own experiences and engage with my femininity as a disabled, queer cis woman, rejected from womanhood. 

I love women, I'm bisexual and very romantically inclined towards women. I was so excited as a little girl to become one. And of course I also suffered at least the usual amount of sex crimes associated with being AFAB, but somehow the heartless way many cis woman have treated me in my life has hurt more. I'm 44 and only just recently have I found a group of girls to be in a bit of a gang with. 

So when TER / GC women talk about the safety of female only spaces I don't even know what they're talking about. I've taken up too much of your time already but I feel as much as a person with a penis has hurt me the crowd of unsympathetic, hateful cis women I've been around in my lifetime has hurt me more in incomprehensible ways. I can understand the motives of sex offenders, but not theirs. And outside of that trans women and their thinking has played a huge role in making safe spaces for me.

This law basically means veganism is due the same respect as a person's religion: an employer can't say, ""you're fired because you're a Vegan and I don't like that.""

...

The answer GC is looking for is the seemingly paradoxical fact that if everyone's beliefs are to be tolerated, we have to exclude intolerant beliefs. A fundamentalist Muslim can't say ""I won't serve female clients or work with female colleagues because I believe It's wrong,"" and I (a vegoon) can't say ""I won't serve meat eaters because they're violating my beliefs."" 





A protected belief means they can't make *you* violate your beliefs or unfairly sack you because they disagree - it doesn't mean the whole workplace has to conform to your beliefs, or that they must tolerate inappropriate behavior. Being mad that The Trans are allowed use the restroom and be protected from prejudice at work is like me being mad that a colleague is allowed to bring a ham sandwich for lunch. They can't fire me for being vegan, but they can fire me for smacking my colleague in the head with a sandwich while preaching about unneccessary violence and climate change.

...

From the very article they referenced:

But I feel like, up to a point, I really understand and empathize with how a lot of trans exclusive feminists feel, up to a point. And feel a bit gender critical myself.

I imagine myself in their position.

I agree with and sympathize with a lot of what gender critical feminists say. 

That gender roles are wrong and bad. That gender non-conforming people are marginalized. That standing against gender roles is more than just self expression, it's a radical and revolutionary act. That gender non-conformity doesn't mean one is ""born that way"", that it's merely discomfort with oppressive gender norms. And that standing against gender roles and norms is often a social and political act. Taking it upon oneself to dismantle Patriarchy and making a concerted effort to deny gender roles is a brave and radical act.

Imagine being born, assigned female and a girl at birth. Discovering feminism and even radical feminism. Understanding a lot of feminine gender roles and shackles placed upon you because of your vagina and who you were assigned as, to keep you oppressed, something to break out from. The only thing that makes you a ""woman"" or a ""girl"" or a ""real woman"", or possibly in your own words, a ""womyn"" because of the history and origin of the word woman or women, is having a vagina. Nothing more or less.

Knowing gender to mean something more than that being in the history of sexism. ""A real woman stays in the kitchen"", ""women are demure"", ""women and men are different in behavior, and it's hormonal"", ""women and men have different brains"", people telling you how to behave and what a woman is, because of your vagina. Identifying with the struggle of other people identified as ""girls"" or ""women"" because of their vaginas. And the history of gender roles, gender stereotypes, biosexism and neurosexism.

That you feel people are trying to tell you those things they were saying about men and women were true all along. And that you're the bigot and transphobe for standing against biotruths and your oppression. That if you don't feel like the social idea of a a woman, if you want to break out from Patriarchy and challenge gender roles, you might be a transman. Feeling like you're walking on eggshells for simply not understanding how gender identity isn't neurosexist and an understandably major part of a person, but that something like identifying as another race is racist and cultural appropriation. 

Putting myself in someone's position, I can really understand the frustration with gender identity, and seeing oppression in gender identity.

What makes it harder to understand and relate to and support many gender critical feminists is when it does become overtly transphobic. Gender critical women treating transwomen as sexual predators for wanting to go to women's bathrooms. Even though going to men's bathroom's is incredibly dangerous for transwomen. When many gender critical radical feminists want to exclude us, as feminists, from participating in feminist spaces, based upon our genitals and who we were assigned at birth.

When gender critical people stand against gender roles, but try to deny people hormones and transition, and choice over what do with *our own bodies* as some kind of ""ladyface"" akin to blackface. As if we don't have a right to our own bodies and our own self expression. 

Being treated as men who want to speak over and mansplain women, and invade women's spaces.

It's all so very transphobic and uncompassionate. And cruel.

*edit: spacing*

**Addendum**

So, now having realised that hatred isn't getting them anything but justifiable derision they've decided to move to claiming that Lilly isn't actually doing any of this, but is being puppeteered by Momentum, or possibly George Soros, I can never keep up with the latest nutjob conspiracy theory, and when that hasn't worked, have decided to  fully embrace childish patronising as a response to Lilly's existence.  Their utter pettiness when they get called out on their bullshit is truly astonishing and, of course, does wonderfully show up their complete lack of anything approaching critical thought.

In contrast, organizing a bunch of peers to all collectively do something like this to a target is one of the oldest hat tricks in the highschool teenage mean girl play book it has it's own name, ""social exclusion."" This terf has correctly identified that, yes, the appeal of this tactic is that it's almost entirely passive towards the victim themselves and therefore is almost impossible to punish. It's so common and clique it was a major plot point in Heathers, several episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, 13 Reasons Why, the Pretty Little Liars reboot and--- oh yeah, literally the context to which one of the most famous lines from the literal fucking movie ""Mean Girls"" is predicated in, ""You can't sit with us!"" 

*That's a completely inappropriate, distasteful, insidious characterization of what ""gray-rocking"" is, profoundly childish, and really does demonstrate how empty their ""fear"" of being victimized by a trans person really is.* No where in the descriptions and resources for gray-rocking does it encourage you to use any ounce of social authority you have as a cheatcode to getting away with creating a hostile working environment for your peers. 

You don't want to interact with someone at work outside of the barebones requirements? Fine. Your """"""""evil Tim coworker"""""" probably doesn't want to talk to you either, frankly. That's still not gray-rocking, but, whatever. But of course if GCs don't perpetuate the most toxic, female-misogynist flavored behavior at all times they'll explode, so.

1439,pnvqls,2021-09-14,GenderCynical,Regarding AgainstHateSubreddits not accepting *some* posts about FemaleDatingStrategy.,"A few days ago a post was made here - https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCynical/comments/pkill3/ahs_just_casually_defending_femaledatingstrategy/

which claimed that AHS was ""casually defending"" FemaleDatingStrategy.

We specifically stated that we're not defending FDS - it's in the post; it's even in the screenshot.

We were / are refusing posts from misogynists / MRAs that are nothing more than ""But Whaddabout FemaleDatingStrategy"" - because, in the wake of MGTOW being closed (as is noted in the post), misogynists were flooding activism subreddits and meta subreddits with [flamebait-riddled, fallacy-riddled, tone-critical, flat-contradiction](https://i.redd.it/lngletnnp8uz.png) comments and posts of the form ""But whaddabout FemaleDatingStrategy"", which sought to equate the social harm caused by FDS _aimed at men_ with the social harm caused by MRAs, incels, and MGTOW _aimed at women_.

Same phenomenon as ""But Whaddabout SRS"" - it's just a bad attempt at _Tu Quoque_. Most of the posts and comments were just one-sentence ""FDS is misandrist, you need to ban them!"" types.

We also refused those posts because of a lack of Good Faith and Clean Hands - because MRAs / MGTOWs / incels have an obvious ulterior motive: To normalise hatred and violence towards women, and make women's expressions of disgust towards patriarchy equivocated with violence towards women --

We took this step also because we didn't want to reinforce the MRA / MGTOW talking point that what some women are doing in FDS (by sneering at men) is somehow tantamount to MGTOW's incitement to mass murders of women; ""Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them."" - Margaret Atwood.

AHS has [plenty of posts about FDS](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/search?q=femaledatingstrategy&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all) and we continue to accept posts about hatred, harassment, and violent rhetoric on FemaleDatingStrategy, provided that those posts are backed up by _evidence_ - that they're not flat declarations of the form ""FDS BAD"" -

-- evidence of the hate phenomenon must be captured in an offsite archive (which is required for all posts in AHS now - as a way to defeat Reddit's algorithm recommending hate subreddits, and to ensure that we have receipts - proof of the antisocial behaviours, violence, hatred, etc so that hate groups cannot successfully perpetuate the cycle of lying about what happened, [the way /r/gendercritical tried to do when they were shut down](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/hk0w7x/request_for_clarification_on_selfreferential/fwqk0kd/?context=11)).

We _know_ that FDS has many of the features of a cult - but we're not ""AgainstCultSubreddits"". It's not enough for our purposes that they push dysfunctional relationship approaches; It's not enough for our purposes that they sneer at the patriarchy and at dysfunctional machismo; We need a well-put-together and evidenced argument that their group credibly rises to the level of targeting another group for hatred and harassment.

Our modmail is open for questions around the clock, so there's no need to repeat inaccurate speculation (and rumours extracted from KF-constructed Burn Books about people who aren't even on our moderation team ...) - anyone can modmail us and ask for our howto wiki page and FAQ wiki page, or ask about our policies.

Our [HOWTO](https://reddit.com/r/againsthatesubreddits/wiki/howto) provides documentation of our process and standards and explanations for why we do things the way we do them. We also have an [FAQ](https://reddit.com/r/againsthatesubreddits/wiki/faq).

Our first audience is always the audiences of proposed hate subreddits, to persuade them to dis-associate themselves from the hate movement. Our second audience is the moderators / operators of the subreddit, to get them to step up and take responsibility; Our third audience is the public and Reddit admins to bring pressure to bear on admins to take admin action.

We're open to the possibility of documenting any phenomenon of calls to violence against men that may happen on FDS or any other subreddits; We _ideally_ want those posts to be written by women, so that the criticism is less likely to be rejected by the audience of FDS - also, women. 

So, in closing: No, we are neither defending nor giving lip service to TERFs, and anyone telling you differently is selling you something (probably a wedge in the hopes of watching a fight break out). We rejected shitposts from MRAs about FDS for many reasons, including not being anyone's personal army and to prevent furthering a narrative of ""Women Sneering At / Rejecting Men = Men Stalking / Terrorising / Murdering Women"". We have a documented process and gladly accept constructive criticism of that process.

Andrea Dworkin: ""Hormone and chromosome research, attempts to develop new means of human  reproduction (life created in, or considerably supported by, the  scientist’s laboratory), work with transsexuals, and studies of  formation of gender identity in children provide basic information which  challenges the notion that there are two discrete biological sexes.  That information threatens to transform the traditional biology of sex  difference into the radical biology of sex similarity. That is not to  say there is one sex, but that there are many. The evidence which is  germane here is simple. The words ‘male’ and ‘female,’ ‘man’ and  ‘woman,’ are used only because as yet there are no others.”   


John Stoltenberg (parter of hers for 31 years) on Andrea Dworkin: @ In the 31 years we were together those views did not change; she never  retracted them. Nor for her was there ever any contradiction between  being trans-inclusive and her fierce and eloquent radical feminist  commitment to end male supremacy and the sexual violence done to  maintain it”   


Monique Wittig: ""and it would be incorrect to say that lesbians associate, make love,  live with women, for 'woman' has meaning only in heterosexual systems of  thought and heterosexual economic systems. Lesbians are not women""  


Kate Millet:  ""...there is no differentiation between  the sexes at birth. Psychosexual personality is therefore postnatal and  learned""    


Catherine MacKinnon: ""  I don’t think it adds anything to the understanding that has existed  that these are social groups, for at least forty years, to call them sex  classes. I don’t know why women and men being socially defined groups  is coming as a revelation to anyone. It was obvious to all of us in the  early women’s movement that what we live as “woman” is a social  construction of male supremacy, and that the notion that it is based in  nature is its most pernicious delusion. [Kate Millett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Millett)’s  book, Sexual Politics, published in 1969, could not be clearer on this  point. My particular question was OF WHAT is sex socially constructed?  The answer I gave, and still believe, is sexuality. Sexuality is itself  not biological, but social, so the constructing is also the constructed,  which makes sense since there is no place outside society. Transpeople  are doing their best to live and be loved under conditions in which  people still pervasively believe the lie that gender is sex-based,  meaning biologically-determined.""  


Catherine MacKinnon: "" My basic feeling, with Simone de Beauvoir, is “one is not born, one  rather becomes a woman.” How one becomes a woman is not, I think, our  job to police, even as everything about that process is worth inquiry  and detailed understanding. Having been surrounded by born women who do  not identify as women particularly, and reject feminism as having  nothing to do with them, it has been inspiring to encounter transwomen  who do identify as women, actively oppose violence against women  including prostitution (in which those who engage have little choice),  and are strong feminists. “Woman” can be, in part, a political  identification. To be a woman, one does have to live women’s status.  Transwomen are living it, and in my experience bring a valuable  perspective on it as well.""",hiedra__,t2_3ipbnp2m,0.97,234,54

Many of this comment's points are brought up again and again in GC and it's highly upvoted.

> [She] may say that now that he's on ''the other side'', [she] sees what privilege [she] has. But the fact that it took transition and actually taking a female name etc to see a flicker of women's oppression, shows that before transitioning, [she] really had no clue of what it is to be a woman.

I'm not convinced you'd be happy to defend the idea the idea that being oppressed as a woman is the most important property of being a woman. And are you more of a woman if you experience being oppressed as a woman earlier in life rather than later? Not only does this type of thinking exclude unusually masculine or late-blooming cis women, but it also excludes trans men from being men.

Strangely, it also has the side effect of including some unusually feminine cis men as women and including some trans women as women. It's an odd argument to make.

> Men usually don't understand shit of what being a woman is, or what types of abuse we endure, how we're oppressed etc

Agreed.

> while these things are *crucial* in forming us to what we are

They *can* be. We're the product of many things; some genetic, some hormonal, some environmental. Maybe some people *are* defined by their negative experiences. But others might say that the horrible shit they've gone through doesn't define who they are. Everybody has the right to relate to their experiences the way they want to, to make them as big or as little of a deal as they'd like, to remember or to forget (if possible). It's their mind, their identity, and their choice.

It's not one I would make for you. You're welcome to include your oppression in defining yourself. But, similarly, it's not a choice you should make for others.

And if something horrible did happen to you, it's probably a good idea to see a therapist about it.

> Our behaviour as an oppressed class doesn't stem from ~personality traits~ from our ~glittery-cute lady-brain~ it gets imposed on us and is a self-perpetuating force that holds us back.

Agreed. It's a shitty situation. Let's fix it, right?

And it might surprise you to hear, but most of us (1) are against the treatment of women as less than men and most of us (2) do not fetishize some bimbo-like idea of femininity. Granted, some do. And some cis women do, too. But don't take my word for it; lurk around! And most important, don't find one person's story and cling to it as validating all of your previous beliefs; recognize the diversity in our experiences and beliefs. We'll almost always find what we're looking for, so we must be careful about the things that we choose to look for. This is particularly important for communities that look to find the worst in others. That includes ours. That includes yours.

> [She] *never* understood femininity.

I doubt she truly understood being oppressed as a woman until she began being treated as a woman, but defining femininity as the amount of oppression you've faced as a woman is probably not what you were going for, not only because it's probably not consistent with any other definitions of femininity you might have, but also because it's probably more inclusive to trans people than you meant it to be.

It's inclusive to trans people not only because many trans women are oppressed as other women are (because much of the oppression people face is due to *perceived* differences, which is why some cis women and men experience transphobia), but also because much of the transphobia trans women and men face has its roots in misogyny. (e.g. Not looking enough like a typical woman making you less of a woman.)

> As such, [she] wasn't ''trans''

I don't know the best way to define what being trans is, but one way might be something like being able to increase your comfort with yourself when being identified as opposite to the sex you were assigned at birth. Another way would be being more comfortable changing your body with HRT to match that typical of the opposite sex you were assigned at birth.

It has nothing to do with being oppressed, and in a perfect world, women would still be women despite not being oppressed.

> [she] was glorifying an *idea* of a woman, and wanted to become that. But none of that was about womanhood or femininity, or about the complex nature of our oppression. About just how human we are. And that's offensive. [She] should be ashamed of himself.

> Boys can wear pink and play with dolls. Doesn't mean they're female. Girls can ride dirt bikes and play baseball. Doesn't mean they're male.

Correct, it doesn't mean they are.  It also doesn't mean they're not.  It doesn't mean anything either way.  You can be stereotypically masculine, feminine, or neither; male, female, or intersex; and strongly trans through to strongly cis, or anything in between; in any combination.

>> I was told: There are some children who are merely exploring gender roles and expression, as you mention, and yes that's perfectly normal. There are also some children whose brains are wired differently and their very identities differ from their body parts. There's a ton of science on this, as well as on the self harming and suicide that can result when society tells people they are not allowed to be who they know they are. I encourage you to maintain an open main and perhaps do a little reading on the matter before you judge. No one is forcing these children to be or do anything. We're only accepting them and affirming them for who they are.

> And it got a like from a woman who teaches Women's Studies in a university...

Yes, the above is correct.

> How do you argue against the transing of children?

You don't, the same way you don't argue against ""the gaying of children.""

> What about when a kid insists they're the opposite gender? How can gender be INNATE when it's socially constructed?

They're saying they're the opposite *gender orientation*, or neurological sex.  They're *not* saying they're the opposite gender *stereotypes*, which are indeed social constructions.

> Are the kids insisting they're the opposite SEX then?

Only neurologically, and that they *should* be but are painfully aware they aren't in terms of the rest of their physiology.

> If that's the case, isn't it harmful to them to support them in their delusion?

It's not a delusion due to them being aware their body is the wrong sex for their brain.  If they thought they'd already transitioned, *then* they'd be delusional, but wouldn't be seeking to transition.

> Am I being ridiculous?

You're assuming you know more than others about a subject when actually you know less.  This is quite common among people in majority groups, in this case being cis.  I'm sure I'm equally ridiculous regarding racial issues, but I don't try to pretend I know more than people of colour about them.

> I [just got done](http://imgur.com/IanH80F) reading the White Nationalism FAQ by Yggdrasil. It got me thinking about multi-culturalism. I think it has been good from an intellectual perspective in fostering knowledge about diversity; however it has worked very poorly in application to society.

> 
> I don't know if the benefit of knowledge of diversity multi-culturalism brings is worth all the detriments it fosters. More over, knowledge is just as easily attained via education as it is from interaction. My main fear is that a white society may not encourage education of world diversity. However, this has not been in the case of Europe where citizens have a better education than in mixed America. Would a white nation scorn the indulgence of non-white customs by its citizens? 
> 
> I'm curious whether a white nation would super-cede America in the benefits it offers and the ethics it conducts as a whole. My thinking is that a society in which all people feel as brethren, are more apt to behave in a respectable manner and more mindful of the welfare of its members. This seems to be the occurrence in our segregated white communities as well as the case in Western European countries where their standard of living far exceeds America.

I believe in equal distribution of wealth enough so that all people can have the necessities of life, and that whatever luxury is attained after all have their base needs met, is earned with via labor. I do not feel I am to restrict the freedoms of others nor impose my religious ideology or lack there of on others. The only laws which should exist are those which guarantee viable humans their right to freedom and existence. Penalty should only be dealt out to those who restrict other's base rights via their selfish actions. This doesn't prevent me from a WN from my understanding, maybe I didn't comprehend what Yggdrasil meant in his comment that ""liberals"" would object to a white nation. Liberal, for me, doesn't mean the support of affirmative action or reverse racial discrimination.

The kinky hair and ebony skin of black men is simply too foreign from my own European features, I won't even get into what they are lacking culturally. Asian men are typically small in stature which fails to incite feminine feelings in me. The eye shape also is too foreign for me. Latin men again are too dark for my tastes, and a lot of them engage in subversive activity from my experiences. Arab men & Indian men can occasionally be attractive, but for the most part they are far too thin for my tastes. Their culture is also very different than what I am accustomed to. I could never be a submissive door mat to an Arab man, nor could I respect his religion. I don't have much of a problem with Hinduism but I do have an issue with their caste mentality. Jews for me are definitely out, I could never betray my morality or sense of compassion by laying with a Zionist murderer.

Then the Lord **God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man**, and he brought her to the man.

\~ Genesis 2:22

>Just as it sometimes happens that deformed offspring are produced by deformed parents, and sometimes not, so the offspring produced by a female are sometimes female, sometimes not, but male, because **the female is as it were a deformed male**.

\~ Aristotle, *Generation of Animals*, c. 350 B.C

>At this time Izanagi-no-Mikoto asked his spouse Izanami-no-Mikoto, ""How is your body formed?"" **She replied, ""My body, formed though it be formed, has one place that is formed insufficiently.""** The Izanagi said, ""My body, formed though it be formed, has one place that is formed to excess.""

\~ *Kojiki*, Shinto creation myths, c. 711

>It can be argued that woman should not have formed part of the world as it was initially created... a female is deficient and unintentionally caused. For the active power of **the semen always seeks to produce a thing completely like itself, something male. So if a female is produced, this must be because the semen is weak** or because the material is unsuitable, or because of the action of some external factor such as the winds from the south which make the atmosphere humid.

\~ Thomas Aquinas, *Summa Theologica,* c. 1250

>I do say that very learned men have left it in writing that since nature always aims and designs to make things most perfect, she would continually bring forth men if she could; and when a woman is born, it is a defect or mistake of nature, and contrary to that which she would wish to do... Woman may be said to be a creature produced by chance and accident; and that this is so, **mark a man's acts and a woman's, and judge therefrom the perfection of both.** Yet, as **these imperfections of women are the fault of nature** who has made them so, we ought not on that account to hate them.

\~ Baldassare Castiglione, *The Book of the Courtier,* c. 1520

>Undine, the soulless Undine, is the platonic idea of woman. In spite of all bisexuality she most really resembles the actuality. The well-known phrase, **“Women have no character,”** really means the same thing. Personality and individuality (intelligible), ego and soul, will and (intelligible) character, all these are different expressions of the same actuality, an **actuality the male of mankind attains, the female lacks.**

\~ Otto Weininger, *Sex and Character*, 1903

>The sense of inferiority has strong erotic roots. A child feels inferior if he notices that he is not loved, and so does an adult. **The only bodily organ which is really regarded as inferior is the atrophied penis, a girl's clitoris.**

\~ Sigmund Freud, 1932

>Everything about this \[transfeminine\] kid makes me so sad for him. ***He*** **was a beautiful healthy child, turned into** ***this***, by his parents. I consider it abuse. ***He*** **looks sad, his eyes look sad**... I'm angry at the society that cheer-led the **abuse and mutilation** of this child.
