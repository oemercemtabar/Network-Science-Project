0,1anslbc,2024-02-10,MensRights,"In the workplace, incompetent women fail upwards while competent men are kept down","I’m in my late 20s and have worked for a Fortune 500 company ever since I graduated college with an engineering degree. I’ve worked with thousands of people, and have kept tabs on some people’s job titles over the years while remembering the type of worker and person they were when I needed to deal with them. 

I’ve worked with dozens of men that I have gotten to know well enough to understand how competent they are at their jobs, and how they are consistently expected to do the same work as women 2-3 pay grades above them. I’ve seen women slack off, but because they are friends with their female manager, they get every promotion and spot bonus. The men never get promoted and are expected to do the lion’s share of the work and/or the work with the highest stakes. 

I’ve taken it upon myself to go into young men’s career pages in my company where you can leave unsolicited feedback, and write paragraphs about the projects and tasks these men have helped me with over the course of a year in an attempt to boost them up. However, this is usually to no avail. Meanwhile I see women in my office (typically managers and directors) cackling with each other about personal bullshit for hours while the men sit at their desks to grind out the real work. The women don’t really do anything, but somehow get themselves into these cushy positions with high pay. 

I’ve tried to move further up the ladder myself and have done okay. But now I’m in a position where I have women in my department making 40k more than me while doing less work, but my manager is personal friends with a lot of them which apparently makes that ok. I recently shared data that showed how much more work I did (and higher stakes work) than my average coworker (about 25% more), and I got a 3% raise. At this point my plan is to take a giant step back in the amount of work I’m doing while keeping the same pay, save, invest, and retire by 40 with ~1.5 mil.

It’s become such a fucking joke. Unfortunately I don’t see how corporate settings will ever get better for men, unless we all withdraw from the work force and leave all the real work for women. 

TLDR; women receive favoritism in the workplace over men. It’s probably never going to get better. Don’t work too hard.",Thin_Relation3562,t2_tumpfzga2,0.94,202,42
1,160qu14,2023-08-25,MensRights,Feeling the burnout of feminism in the workplace,"So I wanna get this out of the way first, I can appreciate that woman still support feminism for various reasons, but I also don't think it's sexist or wrong to point out the fact that a noticeable amount of feminism is blatant misandry these days.

So I work for a relatively large corporate company, and lately I've been finding it rather tedious to sit through certain meetings or presentations regarding woman in the workplace, because they can blatantly talk negatively about men and disregard them entirely and it's deemed OK.

So we had this lady do a presentation on empowering woman to come into our industry as a career, the usual ""why aren't woman represented more in this field"". The correct answer is that men and women simply have different interests and this just isn't as interesting to woman as it is to men, but no, that's sexist think today. So anyway the presentation was happening, and this particular lady started talking about male privilege, white male privilege, all the privilege. 

A male co worker had politely pointed out that woman also have a level of privilege regarding the workplace, this lady was actually a gender quota hire, hired simply for being female. He pointed that out. She asked for him to be removed from the presentation for being disrespectful and hostile...

So one of the reasons this type of stuff annoys me is because male privilege isn't real. I've never felt like I've had any sort of benefit for being a man, especially when it comes to employment. I finished school and struggled to find work, every employer wanted the 18 year old with 20 years experience, I worked any odd job I could get for years, travelled around the country from town to town, living with relatives or living in hostels just to take these jobs. I flipped burgers at fast food places, worked telemarketing, hard labour jobs, you name it. I dealt with endless time wasting from potential employers, I'd travel a long distance for an interview only to be told then and there by a receptionist that the interview was cancelled, no notice and a generic fake apology.

I've dealt with mental health issues and being suicidal because the struggle to find permanent work was that hard and I was always broke. Finally, I got lucky and landed a job that provided on the job training. Now I work in this industry and while I still have your usual problems here and there that I'm sure everyone does, I'm always grateful that I finally have stable employment even if it's not always fun. Alot of men I know have gone through similar things, especially if they've had an injury at work and have had to try and get back into the workforce after that.

So this lady holding a presentation on how men just have life on easy mode and how they have all these advantages simply for being men, it's just exhausting to listen to. But if you don't attend you're seen as a negative person for the company, if you dare question these feminist woman and challenge their own privilege, like my male co worker did, you're removed from the presentation, and I wouldn't be surprised if HR gave him a stern warning about ""misogyny"" too. The most frustrating part is, imagine if I, a man, held a presentation on men in the workplace and how we don't get the same benefits woman do like being hired simply for being men, or being prioritised in the hiring process because the company wants to have more woman in the company, being hired even if you aren't the most qualified simply because you're a man. 

I've had to fight tooth and nail for everything in my career, so it annoys me because it really comes off as all of my hardships and struggles not being a big deal. But if I said the same thing about this lady, I'd most certainly be fired. But yet, nobody says anything. She even bought up the gender pay gap and used all the same lies and misrepresented info that feminists love using to talk about it. Everyone knew she was completely wrong, but nobody can say anything.

I'm just really fed up with having to go to work and listen to these ridiculous people complain about how everything they have isn't enough and that all the men in that room, men who have gone through alot to get into these jobs and climb the ladder to the positions they're in, are somehow privileged and haven't had to fight for those things. When these same feminist woman (I call them that because normal woman think these ladies are full of shit too), they refuse to acknowledge that they haven't had to work very hard at all to get into those positions and get very defensive if someone mentions things like quota hires. 

Has anyone else dealt with this at their job? We even had a lady who came on to talk about the struggles of being a woman in the workplace, and yet when she talked about her career it was all positives, she was just complaining about how she hasn't seen as much career growth as her male co workers, but even acknowledged that she took alot of time off to start a family and went back to work while her husband stayed home and how she struggled with the pressure of working full time and then coming home to be a parent too, like yea, men have been doing that for decades. That's how it is when you have children as a man, you still gotta go to work. Only these days you see the reverse, but these ladies complain about that now too. 

I'm booking a week off work because I'm just so sick of hearing about it, these ladies who send 3 emails and then need a coffee break, or forever leave work early because their children are sick or something and then they hold these types of presentations to complain about how they don't make as much money, it's because they're at work less often, even the other woman in our office have tried telling them this, but these feminist type woman just don't want to listen. It's like you've insulted them to say yea, you didn't get paid as much this month because you left work early 5 or 6 times and didn't work it back. I'm so glad there's ladies in my office who call this bullshit out too, feminism is exhausting and shouldn't be allowed at work what so ever imo. It's hypocritical that they can have these presentations and disregard all the men, but if a man were to do the reverse, there'd be hell to pay.",AdAny7443,t2_av01gb70s,0.89,40,28
2,177hc7o,2023-10-14,MensRights,White men are actively discriminated against in the job market right now,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm a 32 year old white male in the tech industry. Specifically PM work. I was let go in the mass layoffs months ago by a major tech company that all of you probably know of. I have been in multiple interview rounds with good companies and I have never seen the market this bad for white men ever in my adult career.

Just to preface without sounding like gloating, I have a good resume with solid experience from desirable companies. I've had a number of interviews, and for the positions I want, most hiring managers/majority of panel interviewers have been women, either white or minorities. And oddly enough, every single time I reach the final stages of the interview process and I find myself interviewing with one of these women in a position of power, I get a swift rejection email.

I am cordial, well spoken and friendly. I received two offers from interviews, with the hiring managers/majority of panel members being men but unfortunately they are not companies I am very interested in.

**Two alarming trends I have noticed in tech are that being a white man is an instant negative for most companies**, especially if you find yourself in front of a panel of women or a hiring manager who is a woman. Women are also being promoted to these HM positions in much less time than their male counterparts.

**The other is underqualified women are getting these jobs that white men are competing for at increasing rates.** I checked back for the roles I was rejected for that have been filled and, unsurprisingly, all but one of them were filled by women with less experience than I have.

Just wanted to let other men (white men specifically) that are struggling know that you aren't alone. You don't meet the quotas that these companies have and you are playing against a stacked deck. This is the worst I have ever seen it, and I can only assume it will get worse. I have spoken with close friends and they are experiencing the same thing.

And look they're entitled to their emotional agency about things, that's fine

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My question is, why are they fine using emotional manipulation to ask others to feel pity for them, when the majority of society doesn't even respect men's laboral forthcomings?

&#x200B;

Can you imagine the sheer amount of disrespect and ridicule a man would get if publicly and openly cried or displayed discomfort in his workplace or jobsite?

&#x200B;

And to be honest this is because for awhile men could not afford the luxury of downness letting them get them because somebody had to build up the infrastructure of society

&#x200B;

Obviously tryna avoid generalizations, but it is funny to see so many corporate-driven boss babe types join in the men shaming other men their work ethics, while the majority of women as a whole barely even work anything infrastructure-related

5,1ad9hyw,2024-01-28,MensRights,Are women taking over all the jobs?,"There’s a lot of talk about immigrants taking over jobs in the West. That’s bullshit! The majority of the jobs immigrants do are low-paying and unskilled, which Westerners aren’t willing to do. The real question is whether women are taking over almost all industries in the West. Every job I go to, every shop I buy something at, every doctor I visit, every plane I board, there are more women than men. I barely see men, other than maybe construction or some hard labor. So is there an agenda to hire more women than men? What’s going on? This is not a misogynistic question. This is a genuine question.

 

Edit: I’m from Somalia, which is in East Africa, but I’m currently in the USA. The majority of foreign countries, especially in Asia and Africa, Women stay home to take care of the kids. The few women who do go to work do it temporarily, and most of them prefer to stay at home. It seems like in the West, there’s a huge push by governments and international institutions to get every woman to work. I’ve also noticed that the easier the job, the more women there tend to be.

Final Edit: I've noticed that while working retail and various low-paying jobs throughout the years, the majority of managers, whether men or women, choose to give the hard tasks to men or boys.

7,6uumes,2017-08-20,MensRights,Fuck office politics: newly arrived female coworker is in difficulty with her work and is attacking my reputation behind my back. WTF???,"The reason I post here is because many of the things this coworker does she can get away with it because she's a woman, and she's blatantly using female shaming tactics (people may not agree with the fact these are female tactics, but I think they are), *in the workplace*, to get her way...

She had a task: do her job and learn ho to do new things. Me (and others) supported her. After a few months I no longer had the obligation to support her and I realized she was slacking on purpose (facebook, amazon, chats, etc, instead of working). She... didn't like that. Because she had decided *not* to learn anything, when push came to shove and she needed to deliver, she went mad and started using the only coin at her disposal to fight the situation: social group, gossip, men-hating.

She started attacking me behind my back, trying to ruin my reputation. Her reasoning was that our boss was pressuring her to deliver, she didn't know how to do the job (spent months without applying herself) and because I was capable of doing it, *I had to drop everything for her*.

To quote her (a coworker showed me this):

- ""why doesn't Demian do it instead of me? He's the only one who knows how to do it anyway..."".
- ""I'm stuck with this, the *client* is an asshole, it's not clear what I have to do... of course it would be a lot easier if Demian supported me, but he never helps me...""
- ""this job is shit, can't do it... talk to me about your weekend :)""
- ""I asked X to give me a hand, I'm waiting for him. I watched this cool movie last night...""

Again and again, complaints in private to her friend (one of the PMs) in order to get someone to tell me to do the job *for her*. Never mentioning how she was told, when hired, that *she needed to learn this stuff*! Only implying how she's willing to do the job but my lack of support is blocking her (false and shameless accusation)...

She decided by herself that team work meant she was excempted from every responsibility. This is an example of a chat conversation:

- SHE: demian, you are not busy, right? :)
- ME: I'm busy, sorry.
- SHE: eh... you are doing research... can't you help me with this?
- ME: sorry, but I can't help you. Try to take it slowly and face one problem at a time, you'll get there.
- SHE: but I need someone to show me how it's done...
- ME: and I sent you lots of material months ago, I can't do the job for you..

She grabbed the last message and send it to four different women and a guy so they could support her in bashing me.

I had to protect myself after that. I intervened with certain coworkers and made sure my version was known. After a few days, she made so much noise and her work was so behind that my boss asked me my opinion on her and her work. 

Because of what she did (the chat convo was just one occurrence of her gossip), I sunk her in front of my boss. I spent almost 8 months without saying anything negative about a coworker (her!) in order to avoid putting her in a difficult spot, and what does she does?

She targets me because I don't go over mountains for her (where does the entitlement come from lol????) and decides to fuck with my reputation, just because she was lazy and had to choose between admitting her lack of knowledge to my bosses (damage to her image) or use social games to blame *me* instead (damage to *my* image)...

-------

Right now, I was promoted and next month I'll be in charge of her work. At the moment, she latched onto another coworker, constantly ""asking"" him how to do things, constantly ""asking"" him to look up stuff for her by saying ""she doesn't know how to do the job..."", and implying he has to because of ""team work""...

While the guy looks for stuff up, she opens her chat or facebook and starts doing random stuff or talking with her friends, waiting for him. And the spineless guy refuses to say ""no"" to her, is depressed and overloaded of work all day, and earns even less than she does...

And by the way, whenever the guy can't cope with it anymore and snaps at her, she starts gossiping behind his back telling everyone how this guy is having his ""ladies days""...

The three of us were on the same role inside the company, but unlike us, who focused on the job, she focused on her relationship with the others. At first I thought this wouldn't be an issue because we are all different, until she started using that ""support group"" she formed to backup her up on her lack of skills and all her BS...

Fucking office politics. And fuck women who blatantly push to establish social bonds with other women and then use gossip to get their way against men who actually work and don't give a crap about this stuff...",demian78,t2_ax22xax,0.89,934,219

9,1akqzjk,2024-02-07,MensRights,Is being a male a disadvantage in the workplace for both hirings and promotions?,"I just wanted to gauge other people’s experience on whether they have noticed any potential gender disparities in regard to workplace opportunities (both hirings and promotions) throughout their careers.

In my 15 years of Biotech/Pharma industry experience, here are some of the trends that I have noticed.  

Note: these are just subtle observations that I (n=1) have noticed throughout my career and it may not reflect the norm.

— Hiring Process —
- If an equally qualified male and female apply to the same role, the female candidate is (significantly) more likely to be contacted for an interview.
- When applying to the same role, male candidates must be more qualified than their female counterparts, but they cannot be too qualified.  Otherwise, their application will be rejected.
- When interviewing, men are more likely to experience interviews (neutral) or interrogations (negative), whereas women experience more conversations (positive).
- When companies use a standardized interview process, women are more likely to experience positive non-verbal communication than men.
- When interviewing women, hiring managers are primarily looking for red flags for not hiring them, whereas for men, they’re initially discarded must prove why they should be hired.
- When companies hire women for leadership positions, they are more likely to celebrate and announce the hiring on social media.
- When companies celebrate hitting their diversity targets, it often primarily benefits women (who may actually be the majority in the company or department).
- Hiring managers are praised for hiring women onto their teams over men.
- HR interviewers are primarily women, which likely skews the candidates that move forward with the hiring manager in favor of women.

— Workplace Promotions —
- Women require less accomplishments than their male counterparts to become eligible for promotions.
- Line managers are more likely to assist women with their yearly goals in order to fast-track them for promotions (or give them easy ones).
- Men require more years of experience than women to be considered an SME (Subject Matter Expert) for a given discipline.

— Ramifications of the Above —
- When applying to jobs, women need to apply to less companies before getting hired, they’re more likely to get a highly desired job, and their new job is more likely to be a promotion instead of a lateral move.
- Since men are more likely to have to settle for lateral moves, they will experience more criticism from interviewers if their resume had indicated that they had any history of job hopping.
- Women are getting promoted into leadership positions at a much younger age than their equally or more-qualified male counterparts, allowing them to make hiring decisions early on and influence company culture sooner.
- Since women are getting fast-tracked into leadership, they are earning significantly more money than their male peers of the same age, earning them potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars more throughout the course of their careers.
- Due to the current system, men have jobs and women have careers.
- Since men are beginning to see that the workplace is significantly biased against them, they are engaging in quiet-quitting and only doing the bare minimum (even if that was not their original desired intent).
- Companies are creating exclusive intracompany groups (‘Women in Leadership’) for advancing the careers of women.  Even suggesting such a group for men is a laughable offense (or worse).
- Due to the favoritism toward women, men are more likely to experience poor end-of-year reviews, go on PIPs (performance improvement plans), get assigned grunt work, experience poor morale, get blacklisted, have their ideas get ignored by management, not get credit for their efforts, stagnate in their career, become demoralized by the work environment, etc.",ThrowAway373728491,t2_idc4pazot,0.91,57,15

11,1588ci8,2023-07-24,MensRights,Women have the burden of their appearance in the workplace myth,"**I grew up listening to this theory,** that women have to take care of their appearance all the time, which adds to the burden of their existence. It is only way more difficult, that they are forced to accept the constant flirting of men in the workplace, which is nothing less than harassment, as well as the ""social expectations"", that are being forced on them. 

**Sounds plausible.** Indeed, I need no make-up, my clothes are simpler to choose, my hair easier to take care of. I am not really being hit-upon in the office. My social expectations are not being reinforced on me verbally. But then I noticed how society functions.   


It is that they need to do all these things to reap the benefits, that an avg. woman in society has, which an avg. man cannot even fathom.

Women don't need to be so well-dressed in the office. They are allowed to wear simple clothes, every day the same if they want, crew-neck blouses and suits. They don't however. Furthermore, they like their translucent clothes, form-fitting dresses, heels, make-up and all the other nice stuff. I kid you not, last time I was in the office, I saw the panties of both of my colleagues in 4K and one of them also had a visible bra. They garner attention, that they claim later on that it is necessary. No it is not. It is just, that if you choose to dress like a man, you will be getting the attention of the avg. man. That is none. 

The societal expectations (which are being so incidiously differently defined, based on context) are another issue. A woman needs to be thin, beautiful, good mother, successful, rich or whatever else they claim that society enforces on them. Not really. Nobody enforces that on them. They want that, so that they enjoy the female attention. A woman might also be an adipose, she will just have the experience of a man with an average BMI and 20% fat, which is on the healthier side of the scale.   


It is also ignoring the fact, that a man is being born with those and opting out is kinda difficult. It is not easy to work in female-dominated professions (not only because of prejudice and scorn, but also because these professions seem to attack males), it is not easy to stay at home being a dad, it is not easy ""chickening out"", it is not easy having an average income. But yes, apparently women are being brough at such an uncomfortable position if asked about a family plan (which I get, it can be difficult, but then again, it is not a sexist thing). Or women are being driven out of manly professions because they heard a dick joke, whereas men have to live in this brutal environment and not say a word.

Our leaders are required to take diversity training classes, being led by our chief diversity officer.

I've been trying to understand how the company leadership can support this then I realized there is no downside to them supporting wokism since there is no upside of supporting white men. If they push back they will get fired anyways, so there's no point for them to stop it.

They were taken more seriously, were up for promotion, had papers published in journals when they were men, noticed other male colleagues being misogynistic, but not when they were women or transitioned to being women.

MEN AT WORK

**One day in court, Ward and his opposing counsel** were making a big request to a judge. Ward knew their question would not go over well, so he wasn’t surprised when she reprimanded both him and his opposing counsel for asking. What he didn’t expect was for the opposing counsel lean over to him and call the judge the c-word. “We weren’t out the courtroom door when he said that to me under his breath,” Ward says. “He never would have said that when I was female.”

Many trans men I spoke with said they had no idea how rough women at work had it until they transitioned. As soon as they came out as men, they found their missteps minimized and their successes amplified. Often, they say, their words carried more weight: They seemed to gain authority and professional respect overnight. They also saw confirmation of the sexist attitudes they had long suspected: They recalled hearing female colleagues belittled by male bosses, or female job applicants called names.

“If I’m going off-the cuff, no-one really questions it,” Ward says. “It’s taken as, ‘He’s saying it, so it must be true.’ Whereas while I was practicing as female, it was ‘Show me your authority, you don’t know any better yet.’”

Mitch Davis is now a director of organizational development at Planned Parenthood Federation of America in New York City, but he’s worked in HR for many different companies since coming out eight years ago. In one previous job, he heard his boss call female colleagues “old cows” and refer to a middle-aged job applicant as “Dame Edna” after she’d left an interview. “Evidently men say things like that to each other all the time,” he says.

Other trans men say they’ve heard male co-workers sexualize female colleagues when no women are present. “There’s some crude humor, some crass humor,” says Cameron Combs, an IT consultant in Olympia, Washington. He says he’s heard male colleagues do “appraisals” of women in the office or observe how female co-workers used their “womanly wiles” to rise up the ladder, conversations he says he never would have heard when he was a woman. “When they saw me as female, it was kind of an automatic stop,” he says. “It’s a little less censored, the jokes I hear, the comments.”

Some trans men have noticed the professional benefits of maleness. James Gardner is a newscaster in Victoria, Canada, who had been reading the news as Sheila Gardner for almost three decades before he transitioned at 54. As soon as he began hosting as a man, he stopped getting as many calls from men pointing out tiny errors. “It was always male callers to Sheila saying I had screwed up my grammar, correcting me,” he says. “I don’t get as many calls to James correcting me. I’m the same person, but the men are less critical of James.”

Dana Delgardo is a family nurse practitioner and Air Force captain who transitioned three years ago. Since his transition, he’s noticed that his female patients are less open with him about their sexual behavior, but his bosses give him more responsibility. “All of a sudden, I’m the golden child,” he says. “I have been with this company for 6 years, no ever recommended me for management. Now I’m put into a managerial position where I could possibly be a regional director.”

Trans women have long observed the flip side of this reality. Joan Roughgarden, a professor emerita of biology at Stanford and a transgender woman, says it became much more difficult to publish her work when she was writing under a female name. “When I would write a paper and submit it to a journal it would be almost automatically accepted,” she said of the time when she had a man’s name. “But after I transitioned, all of a sudden papers were running into more trouble, grant proposals were running into more trouble, the whole thing was getting more difficult.”

“As a man, you’re assumed to be competent unless proven otherwise,” she says. “Whereas as a woman you’re presumed to be incompetent unless proven otherwise.”

--------------

There is evidence of a growing number of men, who avoid women in the workplace, avoid being one on one, avoid mentoring women. This hurts women. 

https://nypost.com/2019/05/17/men-are-afraid-to-mentor-women-after-metoo-and-it-hurts-us-all-study/

I read a number of articles on that topic. Another example:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/pragyaagarwaleurope/2019/02/18/in-the-era-of-metoo-are-men-scared-of-mentoring-women/

There is a common pattern. Authors ignore and dismiss concerns of men, they give their own explanations of the experiences, feelings and motives of these men, in condescending and scolding manner and shift the topic to empowering women, defeating bias against women and improving career opportunities for women. So basically men should shut up, stop whining and do their best to help women advance. I'd say, it is basically womansplaining.

I know, that feminism is about women's issues, not about troubles of men. That's fair enough, I totally accept this approach. So let's assume these papers are supposed to fix the problem for women, defeat the backlash against metoo. However, let's see what kind of message does it deliver to these men, who are afraid of women at the workplace? 

Men aren't listened to. Their concerns and point of view are ignored. Men aren't entitled to be treated with dignity and feeling of security. Men are an instrument for the advance of  women... 

So if a man is afraid of women, he receives a message that his fears are completely valid.

Edit:

So. How would you approach that problem (men silently ignoring women, because they are afraid)?",WanabeInflatable,t2_16k72e,0.97,1714,370

\- no touching besides introductory handshakes

\- I NEVER comment on their looks, this applies for both positive and negative comments. I don't even do it when they are not around.

\- I never talk about dating or sex with/around them.

There, its that simple. I followed these rules since I started working and had 0 problems or complaints so far.

In my eyes the not following these rules is a risk not worth taking, especially for unattractive guys like myself.

I've heard my female coworkers calling guys creeps for merely attempting what I would judge to be ""corporate friendly"" and politically correct flirting. It only takes one willing to escalate things beyond gossip to ruin your livelihood.

My immediate boss was a pushy woman who did not understand the concept of boundaries. For example, she made telephone calls at all hours. I immediately make friends and one of the people I got very friendly with was a woman - we totally had no romantic interest in each other - and she acted more like a drinking buddy.

For some reason my boss did not like to see this friendship. For example every day, I had lunch with my female friend. But my boss warned both me and her that we were spending too much time together and I needed to spend time with people who were more knowledgeable in the work we were doing.

My boss started to call me over to her office on the pretense of explaining something or asking about progress on some project I was working on but she started flirting a lot and this involved her putting her hand on my thigh, near my crotch. Her language was also vulgar and amongst other things she made 'jokes' like asking me what size shoes I wore because according to her penis size is related to shoe size.

I sent her an email, copied in to our male, gay manager, outlining her behaviour and why I thought it was inappropriate.

I was horrified when I was fired but doubly so when she reported me to the police for lying about her and tarnishing her reputation! Incredibly the police are taking action against me.

Edit: Please understand that I cannot give more detailed information such as location etc. Others are asking me questions like what can the police do... etc. But I would rather not reply publicly as it might compromise my position and my future course of action. I thank you all for your support.

Reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ocxwrc/why_are_so_many_women_unaware_of_the_emotional/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), however, really set me off to writing this post.

""[Emotional labor](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/emotional-labor-in-the-workplace/202004/emotional-labor-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not) is the regulation of one’s feelings at one’s job."" Although, as acknowledged by the article linked, the meaning has been stretched to mean, ""[Women planning things.](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/)""

Both cases of ""emotional labour"" (and all other cases that include its stretched definition) have one thing in common: an abusive woman.

Picture this: You're a husband who works a job, and are trying to help around the house. Good for you, right? Except, before anything else, you'll be [berated](https://www.katykatikate.com/the-blog/2019/5/7/so-you-want-to-help-around-the-house) for not being a perfect mind-reading magician and doing so earlier. 

Then comes the fun part: Nothing you do will satisfy her. You'll be scolded and called ""incompetent"" for getting the tiniest of details wrong. You're not good enough, and you never will be. Not unless you read her mind perfectly, because she can't bother explaining things to you; she shouldn't have to.

Any confidence you had in yourself is gone, and you stop doing those things you wanted to; you always get them wrong, anyways. This is the real kicker: Now you'll be blamed for not doing enough. You're now a lazy bum, a manchild, a mama's boy. You depend on her for everything, and she can't take it, so she takes it out on you. ""I don't have to ask you to help! You should know already!"". That's the part that gets you. ""You should know already."" You should already know what she needs help doing. You should already be doing the thing. You should already know exactly how to do the thing, to the last detail. You should already know all that, and the only reason you don't is because you're not good enough.

But oh no, you're not the victim in all this; she is, because she's doing the ""emotional labour"". Stop thinking your feelings are valid; they're just a manifestation of your ""fragile male ego"" that ""needs constant appeasing"". She doesn't need to caress your ego.

in full disclosure, i'm a white male, in a creative industry that is being regulated and run by media companies with a heavy woke agenda. i've been working my way up the ladder for 15 + years now and i'm constantly seeing job offer listings with the heading ""(BIPOC) preferred."" make no mistake about it, media companies have an agenda to hire diversity. AKA, anybody but WHITE MALES.

women and people of color are being hired with no experience and being promoted up the chain overnight, something i've been working years to achieve. Further, the older white male bosses, know they're in the cross hairs and can be cancelled any minute and are terrified they are going to lose their rarified high paying job, and are as one boss told me ""making me hire"" diverse candidates, over ability, loyalty and experience.

It's not only the corporate media initiatives on the hiring side, but it's also the content - the content is all about women issues, with trans subject matter. So if you have netflix, hulu, disney, etc. you must notice that all your content is starring women and about women's issues and LBGQT subjects, etc.

Nevermind that Top Gun - an arguably patriotic, male, testosterone, action movie has done billions of dollars in GLOBAL revenue for these same companies.

You'll notice the jobs i'm speaking of are not -- plumbers, construction, electrical, truck driving, HVAC -- fields that women have no interest in, that require specialized skill and intensive labor. These are creative jobs where the only SKILL you have to have is be able to feel and relate as a woman or diverse person of color. Experience, skill be damned. The question USED TO BE ""what experience do you have?"" now the question is ""what gender and ethnicity are you?""

Further, my bosses on my last shows were ALL WOMEN (making million dollar salaries). so the notion that women are being subjugated and oppressed and dont have any mobility or opportunities, is patently false.

if i'm my own critic? hey it's social darwinism.  the times are changing, bud!  and get used to it, pal! The patriarchy is over!

but it's a tough pill to swallow. And I am angry and fed up. i'm just a guy who works his ass off and is being pushed to the back of the line because of my gender and skin color.

I'm not sure what to do. I feel like i have to leave my dream and go elsewhere. Become a grey man and disappear. But it's happening. and I'm not sure how to adapt. But I'm in boiling water now and i dont expect it to change.

33,11asgcb,2023-02-24,MensRights,Women need to be called out on their hypocritical use of sexuality in the workplace,"Why does nobody has the balls to call this out?!

Women use their sexuality in work and work related settings ALL THE TIME. When they want a favor from a coworker, when they need help, when they are looking for a raise or promotion, when they are trying to get a new client/customer.

I had several dates with highly successful beautiful business women and they all laughingly admit of flirting and leading coworkers or clients/customers on in order to get that sale, promotion or just get it ""their way"". Had a date where the female CEO said if the client is a man, she sends one of her hot employees, always. And i myself -of course- over the years first hand have seen women get all girly and sexy, start using their cute girly voice when they need a favor or whatever. Its so blatant and normal, everyone knows it.

Yet women flip the fuck out when a man tries to be flirty or tries to use sexuality in their favor. They act like its an  unthinkable immoral crime that needs to be punished. If you ask women if sexuality belongs in the workplace, they all say ABSOLUTELY NOT. Yet they use it every single fucking day. Hell women told me they dress sexier for clients when they want to get a deal/sale. They flirt, they drop sexual suggestions only to later shoot the man they led on down. This all would be fine...if they weren't hypocrites that literally try to cancle and destroy men who dare to flirt back or god forbid initiate a flirt.

Coworker or customer flirts with woman at work = Oh god look at that creepy piece of shit. He should be reported and fired, this doesn't belong in the workplace.

When men enter female dominated industries such as nursing. They are usually either not given any credit and or mocked.   


People think its weird when men enter female dominated industries particularly psychology and social work, teaching (at least k-8 grades), healthcare administration etc.   


When it comes to manual labor jobs like construction trades there is zero call for women in those industries but when women work in them they get the same big deal treatment they get in the IT areas.

When women enter male dominated spaces they tend to be the center of attention and treated special. When men enter female dominated spaces they tend to be ostracized or used for heavy lifting and grunt work.

37,b04wtm,2019-03-12,MensRights,Lost my job because I was targeted for being a white male,"I'm a 33 year old white male, and I am a mental health counsellor. I worked on a team with 4 other females, all counsellors/social workers/etc. On that team was a 23 year old who made her opinions about men very clear. Back in August she presented my manager with a list of things that I had said that offended her. I had no idea I was saying anything that offended her. There was about 6 things on this list, and many of them were just me expressing a different opinion than her. It was certainly never my intention to offend anyone with these opinions, and they weren't racist or sexist or derogatory. I've shown this list to many people, including many women, some of whom said they disagreed with some of my opinions, but none said they were worth complaining about. What's worse is this individual took the things I said, and twisted them, either misquoting them or taking them completely out of context, to make me look a certain way. I don't think she did this intentionally, I do believe this is what she heard me say as my words went through her filter. 

She took it to the manager, who is a female and has also demonstrated having a negative bias towards men. For this reason, I was not offered the chance to tell my side of the story; I was ignored when pointing out that I didn't say these things the way she is saying I did. I was offended, and pointed out to my manager that other people on the team, including the woman who presented this list and my manager herself, have made comments that I could have complained about should I have wanted to. My manager has also commented on my appearance more than once, which is sexual harassment, and I reminded her of this (although I didn't put it that way). I stated that I felt this was incredibly hypocritical, but it didn't matter; I was sent to anti-racism anti-oppression training, one-on-one with a trainer chosen by my manager. I showed him the list, told him my side, and he said, in his professional opinion of doing this for 20+ years, that he felt I'm being singled out and I'm being sent to this training to be ""fixed"" so I'll go back to work, shut my mouth and be quiet. He believed this was a team issue being turned into a me issue, and I agreed. This was in September. In November we met with this trainer as a team. It was uncomfortable. I expressed my fear of sharing an opinion that someone disagrees with lest it be held against me at a later time. But we did the training, and things went back to normal. My working relationship with this young woman was never the same, but it was civil. 

Flash forward 3 months, when I am sitting in my office waiting for my first client of the day, and my manager and an hr rep entered my office and told me I am being let go because I ""don't fit in"" and that my ""views are better suited elsewhere."" It was out of nowhere. I had been so careful with everything I had said since August. I received no warning, no investigation, no opportunity to fight for my job. It was decided.

I have dedicated my life to helping others. I do not discriminate against anyone, quite the opposite in fact. I help individuals of all genders, sexual orientations, races, religions, ethnicities, ages and so on. I help many people who have been discriminated against, oppressed, or stigmatized. But I was on a team with a 23 year old female who only ever saw me as a white male, and she targeted me, and she was successful. She has had an impact on me financially, on my career, and a severe impact on my mental health. I hate her, and I hate my biased manager who handled the situation different than she would have if the roles were reversed. This is a scary time.

Edit: I should have mentioned I consulted an employment lawyer. He is a friend of a friend, so I trust him and his advice. He said that although I likely have a case of discrimination, he strongly suggested I don't take legal action on the basis of discrimination, due to the fact that I am straight, white and male. He said that win or lose the case, it would reflect bad on me, particularly in the field that I work in.

The list:
-age (she was the youngest on the team by 10 years. Myself, and the rest of the team, would occasionally playfully tease her about her age. I never once put her down because of it. At a team meeting she asked all of us to stop it, and I know I did. And yet, it still made the list) -he said that questions about power and privilege on interviews are useless (in fact, I said ""I didn't see the point"" but I was referring to one specific case, but that's a whole other story. But she generalized it, and that was not my intention or meaning nor my words) - mat leave (the women on the team were having a conversation about how the US was cutting parental leave time and were talking about how sexist it is. I said I don't think it's fair to call it sexist because, although it disproportionately affects women, it affects all genders who would take parental leave) -said he wanted another male on the team; ""there are too many of you and only one of me"" (at a team meeting we were talking about hiring a new person for the team, I suggested we consider hiring another male as some clients request male counsellors specifically and because I felt it might add some more diversity to the team. I was often shut down very quickly if the women on the team did not agree with my opinion. I certainly did not say the words she put in quotation marks) -you look nice (said to her ONE TIME in the year I worked with her before she gave this list, because she got dressed up for a presentation and I was just trying to be nice. I didn't think anything of it. I certainly wasn't hitting on her or flirting with her, and again, it was a one time occurence)
-he is aggressive when his point is not agreed with and does not take into account other people's feelings (in fact, I would often be shown aggression from the females on my team. When I suggested hiring another male, the 23 year old snapped at me ""you can't say that!!"" and she clearly did not take into account my feelings.

I'd be interested to get a total breakdown of all causes of work related diseases and deaths.  I'm sure it's 70%+ across the board for men, if not 90%+.  And at only one third of the total, this probably represents around 2.26 million fatalities a year.  Other causes besides accidents on the job are chronic diseases like black lung disease and mesothelioma, which mostly affect men.

45,16ov98r,2023-09-21,MensRights,Hostile work environment caused by new female hire,"Never posted here before, not much of a men’s right activist. Felt the need to vent after getting home from work. I’ve been working at my job for the past two years, i was happy for the first year and a half. But the past six months have been hell and mainly that has in my opinion been caused by my boss’s boss who is female and her push for “diversity.” Our job is technical in nature but also requires the ability to lift heavy objects. This has made it a male dominated office as we can do both roles, technical reports and field inspections and the heavy lifting. We had women who worked there but they moved on to other jobs, they were great at it and we lost two great employees. 
     Our department head who has never done the job before decided in her infinite wisdom that we need more “diversity” as in we needed a specific gender regardless of qualifications. This has led to an absolute dumpster fire that culminated in a new hire that we just got accussing me of sexual harassment because I was according to her “too nice” and must have ulterior motives. She wrote this in an email today to my boss at the end of day in our air conditioned office while I’m outside sweating and working myself to death. She is planning on getting pregnant and now cannot work outside or do any lifting even though the job requires you to be able to lift 40 lbs. We would have gotten another guy who had expierence and skill in the field we work. 
     But my boss was overridden by the department head and a committee of four women somehow inexplicably also picked a women instead of the guy who had qualifications. She has also accused another of my co workers of “flirting” with her and he now refuses to talk to her and leaves the room when she shows up. I am going to apparently follow suit to not have to deal with this craziness. There is more with the other women who work in our office but I’m not going to go into detail here.

48,22im1h,2014-04-08,MensRights,"I work in PR, and this happened in a meeting the other day.","So I was in a staff meeting the other day, and our CEO (a man) brought up the fact that we may need to hire more men, since the company seems to be mostly women (there were only 6 guys and 25-30 girls) in the meeting. The CEO likes to joke, and he mostly just said this as an observation, not as any sort of policy shift.

However, when he said this, all of the women in the office had a comment to the effect of ""Well of course it's mostly women, it's PR!"" Essentially saying this is a job for women, not men, although maybe not so black and white. 

*For background, I am the only man that has been hired in the last year at this company. Roughly 10-13 women have been hired in the same period.

I was not offended by these statements, but I noticed that this is an attitude that has gotten a lot of men in business in trouble over the last few decades, particularly in fields like finance. And since there are several women in my office who are feminists and very sensitive to statements like this coming from the other direction, I thought it was pretty hypocritical and telling.

I mentioned this to a girl in my office that I'm friends with and she was taken aback, as she didn't even realize she/they had that attitude until I pointed it out, but couldn't deny I had a very good point.

I'd love to hear if anyone here has thoughts/similar experiences.

Edit: To avoid having to respond to like 10 different comments individually, I figured I'd just lay out my beliefs on this matter in general, as well as within my company:

I was in no way offended by what happened in my meeting, I was more amused, as I find hypocrisy amusing to point out. Most of the women I work with are great people, and most (once again, most) are great at their jobs. In fact, some of the women in my office are consciously harder on the girls in my office that have more of a stereotypical ""girly"" personality, as they feel it affects their professionalism.

I 100% do NOT feel discriminated in my workplace because I'm a man, and my gender has definitely not affected my success at the company (that I'm aware of at least, but from my recent performance review they are very happy with what I'm doing).

Generally, as some below pointed out, I totally agree that some fields are more appealing to one gender over another, and frankly I am sort of lucky, as some of the girls I work with have said that, at past PR companies that they have worked at the women composed 90-100% of the employees. 

Frankly, I think gender roles are more of a social issue than a professional issue, and that people should simply be hiring the best people for the job, regardless of gender. Not to be callous, but it's BUSINESS.

50,15qgwv7,2023-08-14,MensRights,Workplace Gender Discrimination?,"Hello! I was hoping someone could tell me if what I’m experiencing is actually discrimination and worth going to HR. Apologies in advance as it's very long:

The entire division went away for a team offsite to do training, team building, etc. During the second day we had what they called speed dating where one side would rotate and you’d have 2 minutes to connect with each team member. When the division head and I had our 2 minutes, the first question she asked me was how is married life. I responded that it was great. The second question was why did you get married. I immediately felt uncomfortable. When I responded that I love my wife and wanted to begin the next chapter of my life with her, she responded that doesn’t seem like a reason to get married. She then asked me how long did you date your wife before you got engaged and when I responded she said that doesn’t seem like a long enough time before you proposed. I felt even more uncomfortable and I tried to change to subject and asked if she has any travel planned in the near future. I told my manager at a team dinner later than night and she said that’s ridiculous she would ask you that question but otherwise brushed it aside and didn’t escalate.

Later during the offsite, we had breakout team dinners where groups of roughly 10 people were aligned with 2 team leads for dinner. After everyone’s dinners, many people met at a bar. I saw a team lead inappropriate touch and essentially hit on lower-level team members. One of the team members felt violated and screamed for him to stop and she came over to me to essentially save her. I was one of the few sober people there and tried to control the situation. There was another team lead there, but he didn’t do much to control the other team lead. The next morning, the woman and I made a comment to our manager during lunch and the manager went to HR to raise this issue. During the next two weeks, my manager would regularly say to me in our 1:1s make sure when you get interviewed by HR, you say the full story of what you saw and also share how the team lead made everyone feel. It was as if they had a personal vendetta against him before this incident and they wanted to get rid of him. I’m definitely not saying what he did was appropriate. A week later, the division lead pulled me aside in the lobby before we went our separate ways. She said, I’m not sure if you are quiet in your personal life but you can’t act that way at work. You should have stepped in and stopped the team lead at the offsite. When I explained that there was another team lead there, she cut me off and said I don’t care it’s your responsibility not his. I responded how I attempted by telling the team lead to stop and how the woman came to me but the division lead cut me off saying you don’t need to say anything else; I’m just telling you not to act professionally the way you might act privately outside work. I felt very uncomfortable, bullied, and it was as if I did something wrong. I was interviewed by HR about the incident with the woman and after explaining the story, she made it very clear I did nothing wrong and if anything, it was the other team leads responsibility to get involved and the fact you did more than him speaks volumes. A few weeks later, the team lead that was inappropriate was fired.

A few weeks later, I had a 1:1 with the division lead scheduled for 15 minutes. Everyone on the team had these 15-minute syncs scheduled over a few months. I came prepared to the meeting with a list of numerous questions such as giving her an update on what I’ve worked on and accomplished recently, asking what was on her radar for the next quarter for a leadership level and also if there was anything I could help her out with or further help the team, I asked if she had any recommendations for me in terms of developing my career at the company. For all of my questions, she gave one-word answers and it was very obvious from her expressions and not paying attention that it was the last place she wanted to be. When I asked about career development at the company, she told me “you don’t get it and you should get on a project”. When I told her I’ve told my manager for the past couple of months that I’d like to get on a project, she said oh and that was it. I still to this day don’t understand what she means that I don’t get it especially since all of my reviews, goal results, and feedback have been strong. The 1:1 lasted 6 minutes even though it was scheduled for 15 minutes. I asked others how theirs went and the women said she gave lengthy responses and was helpful while some men I asked said it was as bad as mine. I mentioned to my manager that my 1:1 went poorly and she said she wasn’t surprised and will try to do damage control whatever that meant. I asked my manager if she thought the division lead had something against me or if there was gender discrimination. She said I know she gives men a more difficult time than women and that there is a treatment level difference between genders. I was very shocked but not surprised based on everything I’ve seen.

Also, the sub-team I’m on is only women and me. My manager seems to treat the women on the team, most who have been with her for many years, significantly better and works to get them promoted multiple times over since I’ve been here over the past 2 years. Also, my manager has made statements over the past 2 years on other men mansplaning things to her and also her issues with how many men there are compared to women at the company and how she wants to try and balance it out.

I also want to say, the division lead and my manager are extremely close and I know this will be held against me and also she won’t admit to things in order to protect the division lead.",jf8617,t2_500v2568,0.92,31,18

Mainly because: **(A)** Feminists seek leverage over men and **(B)** Because they think leadership is not a masculine trait. 

To be fair leadership is not a male only trait but IS a masculine trait meaning a woman with strong leadership skills is far less likely to also be a feminine woman. Look at Angela Merkel for example, not the peak example of femininity now is it? 

Which also means all the divas in leadership positions are there just for the trophy and likely were put in there by men to begin with because..they are women, they're pretty or something. I am an office worker I have no problem working with women if they deserve to be in the spot.

But the main problem with this feminist movement about workplace equality in numbers is that it is very position-biased, **regardless** of a job's payment, the women will rather be bosses for 1k a month than workers for 2k a month, even tho ""women are just as physically capable as men"" clown ass statements still dare to leave their mouths.

She doesn't get her way - If you don't do things the way she wants she yells and screams like a child. Everyone's a target, even the managers.

You dare to challenge her - First she hurls word-salad at you, then insults, then just downright discredits. Prove her wrong and she starts throwing every imaginable ism, accusation, dagger she can at you.

You even think about saying no to her and you've just released every safety imaginable.

Incredibly two-faced, constantly in everyone's business, constantly lies, spends more time typing daggers to other departments than actually working.

I say this because she has a long line of complaints against her from tons of customers and employees spanning literally YEARS.

Not like he’s trying to get back into the military although I even disagree with women being allowed to have longer hair but men basically have to be bald but that’s another topic for another time… 

He has an associates and a bachelors degree along with great job experience. Yet, his hair is stopping him from a good job? He has very clean healthy blonde hair that is long but he always puts it in a tidy bun or tidy ponytail. Sometimes he will even slick his hair back into a bun for a more formal approach.

67,134yvsg,2023-05-01,MensRights,The 'gender pay gap' is a myth. It should be called the 'gender earnings gap'.,"The so-called ‘gender pay gap’ is one of the central tenets of feminist doctrine. Of course, in one sense, it is a fact. Estimates vary, but on average, women will earn about 75-85% of what men earn over their lifetimes. We might more accurately refer to this as a gender earnings gap than a gender pay gap, but whatever you call it, I won’t argue. It seems pretty clear to me, and I don’t doubt the statistics. The question is whether or not it matters. If one can reasonably extrapolate from those figures that women earn less than men purely because of workplace discrimination, then that’s an issue. But the correlation between gender and lifetime earnings is nowhere near as simple a picture as feminists make out.

The idea most frequently conflated with the gender earnings gap is that of unequal pay. The notion that women are paid less than men for doing the same work is often—implicitly or explicitly—touted as the reason women earn less. But paying one gender less than the other for the same job is illegal, and it has been for over fifty years. Indeed, if it were possible to pay women less than men for the same work, one would expect businesses to reduce their labour costs by employing more women. But that’s the opposite of what happens. 

On average, even the women who work 'full time' work far fewer hours than men, and this is just one of the many reasons they may earn less over a lifetime. They also choose different careers from men, are less likely to do dangerous jobs or relocate for a higher salary, and tend to prioritise other things, like children and family. None of this has anything to do with the relative amounts men and women might be paid for doing the same work. The difference between equal pay and the gender pay gap is important and seems straightforward enough, but the deliberate conflation of the two concepts is ongoing, and many feminists are desperate to keep it alive.

Take the Fawcett Society’s ‘Equal Pay Day’. This is described as “a national campaign led by Fawcett Society in the UK. It marks the day where women effectively on average, stop earning relative to men because of the gender pay gap.” In the US, the Whitehouse itself is in on the act, which it does to highlight “how far into a new year a woman must work, on average, to earn what a man did in the previous year.” In 2023, it was March 14th. The justification for this is that “women working full-time, year-round are paid an average 84 cents for every dollar paid to men.” 

The implication is that throughout the workforce, and with consistent and predictable regularity, employers are breaking the law by paying women 84% of what they pay men for the same work. But is that really what’s happening? How could such a flagrant disregard for employment legislation be taking place on such an enormous scale, and all through the relatively quantifiable, traceable conduits of taxable salary payments? The answer is that it’s not. Women are not being paid 84% of what men get paid for the same work. They can’t be, because they’re not doing the same work. 

Amongst the top female-dominated jobs in the US and the UK are nursing, childcare, and secretarial work; amongst the top male-dominated jobs are construction, plumbing, and vehicle maintenance. In the US, the annual mean wage for all occupations is $58,260. Out of the top ten female-dominated professions, all but three pay an annual mean wage which is lower than that, and the annual mean wage for the top ten female-dominated professions combined ($50,581) is almost ten thousand dollars lower than the national mean. On the other hand, five of the top ten male-dominated fields pay higher than the overall mean, and the average for the top ten male-dominated jobs comes in at $59,643, or in other words, $1,383 higher than the overall average.

The average annual pay in the UK is £31,285. Again, only three of the top ten female-dominated professions pay more than that, compared to five of the top ten male-dominated professions. The top ten female-dominated professions in the UK pay an average of £26,925 for 35 hours of work; the top ten male-dominated professions pay an average of £30,451 for 48 hours of work. The Fawcett Society takes care not to highlight facts like this on Equal Pay Day, but it’s worth noting that in the UK, not only are men working longer hours, they are actually getting paid a *lower* average hourly rate than their female counterparts.

So what does all that tell us? Men and women pick their careers with some predictability along gender lines. Men work longer hours and get paid more overall, although their hourly rates aren’t always better. They also do some of the more dirty, dangerous jobs that women don’t like. Similarly, women tend to do things men don’t like. These jobs often require fewer working hours and offer more flexibility. That’s hardly a fashionable thing to say, and I am by no means advocating for adherence to traditional gender roles, but the statistics reflect a freely exercised choice, and remain true whether you like them or not. 

This element of choice is crucial when discussing the gender earnings gap with any nuance. Another key element is age. When you bring age into the equation, you realise how much of a blunt instrument those much-touted ‘gender pay gap’ statistics are. Longitudinal studies tracking the trajectories of professional men’s and women’s careers over time have shown a negligible earnings gap for the first ten years after university. Around ten years in—which coincides with the time most graduates start having families—a divergence between average male and female earnings starts to set in. Feminists waste no time in concluding that this is due to sexism. But could it be that women at that stage in their careers just have different priorities in life?

In a recent Yale study of management-track employees from a large retail chain, researchers lamented the failure of higher-ups to promote female employees. In their abstract, the study's authors rush to conclude that this is due to hiring managers' inability to recognise women's leadership potential. Yet the researchers also found that female employees were less likely to accept promotions when they were offered, citing longer hours, less flexible working patterns, and potential relocation as barriers to acceptance. Indeed, when isolating promotions requiring relocation, the ‘gender promotion gap’ was significantly more pronounced. The researchers’ data also showed that men were more likely to leave the firm to look for promotion elsewhere if they were passed over internally. In other words, more men than women were prepared to secure a higher salary by committing to work longer hours, enjoy less flexibility, and undergo the upheaval of leaving the company or moving home. 

It may reasonably be deduced that not only do women tend to choose different careers from men, but they may also exercise greater freedom of choice when navigating those careers. Should work and family issue competing claims for their attention, they at least have the option of picking between the two. The element of female choice is often missing from the gender earnings gap debate, presumably because it might make the gap look like a good thing for women.

Another frequently absent point of discussion is the financial pressure upon men starting a family. Whilst it is perfectly obvious why a new mother might want to work less, it is equally logical, although less commonly talked about, that a new father might feel he needs to work *more*. The financial anxiety that comes with children can be terrifying for men, not least in a society where high-earning careers are touted as a birth right attendant upon ‘male privilege’. However, when men do pursue advancements in seniority and salary, their actions are often attributed to an ugly desire for power and domination. 

Yet the average man is not an individual economic entity; he exists as part of a household structure which commonly includes a woman, and she benefits as much as he does from any advancements in his career. This particular elephant in the room is often ignored, but cohabiting heterosexual couples are the norm, particularly amongst those who have children. As such, the amount of money a woman earns and the amount she can access are not the same. The average married woman is hardly likely to oppose her husband seeking a pay rise so he can provide for their children. In doing so, rather than embodying the stereotypically selfish, domineering corporate pig, he may be seeking greater financial reward out of a sense of responsibility, duty, and love. And it so happens that the time this becomes most pressing for him is the time that many women are pulling back from their careers. It will be an unpalatably congenial thing for a feminist to admit, but when viewed this way, the divergence in male and female earnings after a decade of work seems to be less about female subjugation than it is about female choice, male sacrifice, and familial cooperation.",AntifeministWisdom,t2_9hdlhwt2k,0.94,489,99

NBC highlights a series of quotes by both men and women in post MeToo era.   

The women give mostly vague answers.   Some of them say they feel more ""empowered"".   

A few of the men say it hasn't affected them, however the majority are as follows: 

""I minimize my interaction with women now and under no circumstances will I be in a room alone with a woman again."" 

""I won't say anything to a woman about her clothes, shoes, hair, etc.""  

""I have always been respectful of all co-workers, but after MeToo, I find myself avoiding social interactions entirely.   I've become more disconnected than ever."" 

""I am more cautious around women.   I try to not look in their general direction anymore…I tend to imagine that I am interacting with a male co-worker or a sophisticated AI, a machine if you will.""

""I no longer feel comfortable joking around with [women] about any topic, as these days they can say anything feels like an unwanted sexual advance.""   

""I can't do anything anymore.""  

""It made me a little afraid to say anything to female/male co-workers that they may take it the wrong way and scream MeToo.   I find my conversations are much shorter than they normally would be.   They are strictly about work and nothing else.   No questions about family, friends, what they did over the weekend and things like that.""  

""I keep all interactions and discussions with women as short as possible and limited to work-related topics only, with no joking around.""  

""Even before MeToo, I would not meet with students in my office with the door closed.  Now, many of my colleagues will not allow a female students alone in their office even with the door open.""  

""No more young people of any gender can go on trips with management.  People who do travel together must also be the same gender.   We also cannot sit next to each other on the plane.""  

""No meeting with women in my office.  No one-on-one meetings with any women.   No more walk-and-talk meetings with women to the coffee shop.  When traveling, I will no longer coordinate to be on the same flight or sit next to a female co-worker.   No hugs for anyone."" 

""Everyone's afraid of being falsely accused of something.  The 'human factor' has disappeared…There is no sense of friendliness or warmth anymore so that nothing can be misconstrued."" 

So to summarize: the relationship between the sexes in the workplace is now ice cold.   The ""human factor"" is disappearing, and many men are clearly uncomfortable even engaging in small talk with the opposite sex.    

Some men and women have been subject to actual sexual harassment in the workplace; and men responded to these complaints several decades ago by introducing various anti-harassment policies.   

Feminists have not improved matters.   Instead, they have succeeded in creating a hostile work environment for ALL workers.     

Women will themselves be negatively affected by these trends.   However, one quote from the article anticipates that feminists will not take responsibility for their grossly irresponsible behavior, and instead blame -- you guessed it -- the patriarchy.   

""I am a woman and MeToo has screwed me.  In Silicon valley it is really hard to get time with VCs [venture capitalists], so you do whatever it takes.  A lot of time that would be meeting them at a bar in the evening…It is good networking and that is how I got my initial seed funding.   But now no one wants to meet with a woman under 40.

86,5lw71f,2017-01-04,MensRights,Millennial Entitlement in the workplace leading to a lot of false harassment claims about men?,"I was wondering if anybody else has had this problem.

I had to hire a social media manager for my gaming company. Basically you make some Facebook and Twitter posts, and collect 50k a year. 

After some telephone screenings I offered an interview to one girl, she was a 21 year old student working a minimum wage job at the time. It was great opportunity, good money, flexible schedule, etc. She told me her only day off that week was Memorial Day. My building is closed on this Holiday, but I was going to work through it anyhow, so I scheduled the interview. She e-mailed me a hour before the interview to tell me she had taken a last minute shift and would not be able to make it, and would like to reschedule. I told her that there was no rescheduling, and that this job was a big opportunity for her. If working in the gaming industry is truly her dream job then she should prioritize her schedule accordingly. I told her if she had changed her mind, or had a lunch break or something, that she could drop by and I'd still give the interview.

The next day my company got a call from her mother, who claimed that I was very unprofessional, that she had given a fair warning for cancellation, and I should have rescheduled. She further said that I had no right to chastise her daughter, and that I was a disgusting evil man. She went on to say that I should be fired, and that her daughter should be given my job. When my manager refused, her mother said that she would call the press and claim that the real reason why her daughter didn't show up was because she was afraid that I was going to rape her. That it was weird that I'd offer an interview on a Holiday (it was her daughter who suggested this date).

The solution? She wanted another interview. So I gave her another one. Of course I didn't hire her, but we gave it to her.

So now, we still have the position open. I was thinking of offering the position to a 23 year old grad student, who had a pretty decent interview. The only issue was that during the interview, it almost felt like she was interviewing us, as if we were ""bidding"" with another company for her services. She even scoffed at one of our questions, as if it was""beneath"" her. But, she had a good resume. I just wanted a quick 10 minutes phone call to ask a few more questions, mainly to calm my initial reservations about her ""entitled personality"". 

I emailed her and told her she was a finalist, and that I just had a few more questions to ask her. If she was available for a quick 10 minute phone call. She replied very professionally, that she was very interested, and provided a list of 5 different times and dates in which she'd be available for that phone call...the closest one being 5 days away.

I was shocked, that this student of all things, would not jump at this opportunity. If it were me, I would have jumped on a phone call right away. So I replied back ""I'm not asking for your availability, I just need a 10 minute phone call.""

She replied back that ""She was no longer interested in the position."" The next day, she called my work, and complained that I was unprofessional and had insulted her.

Notice how 93% of workplace fatalities are still men.  A fact that men apparently do not get compensated for.

~~The math is pretty simple, though not obvious at first:~~

~~$1 / ($1 + $0.77) = 0.56~~

I think this shows pretty clearly what the largest factor in the earnings gap is.

Of course the fact that men have to work longer hours than women is itself a problem. Paying for dates and bills for your girlfriend / wife isn't exactly cheap. Not to mention that many women look for men who earn more money, thus creating an incentive for men to sacrifice their work-life balance in order to earn more.

I guarantee most men would love to work fewer hours and spend more time at home but the spending and earning patterns of their partners don't often facilitate this.

This also contributes to poorer health outcomes for men and the fact that men die 5 years earlier than women on average.

**Edit:** Graph is fine, title is misleading.  The 77 cents per dollar thing is likely just a colloquialism at this point.

95,14767pt,2023-06-11,MensRights,False Title IX allegations costed me my on campus job.,"These event played out from fall of ‘21 to the spring of ‘22 (March). This is a long post so please follow through with it all for backstory purposes.

Going into my senior year of college, I finally landed a position in my university’s housing department that I desired since 2020. (Pre-Covid, actually). The position was called a “Resident Director” or RD for short. I started out as an resident assistant (RA) in spring of ‘20 and got promoted entering my senior year in the fall of ‘21 after a two round interview process with our live-in professional staff and our directors of the department. I was placed on a alternate list because graduate students were given priority for the position. But thankfully, I received my offer in April of 2021. Looking back now, I should have just saved myself the stress and heartache and denied the position.

The resident director position at the time offered a $700 monthly stipend for 10 months, a free two bedroom apartment in the dorm building you were assigned to, a private office, and staff parking. The position now actually provides a scholarship on top of the already mentioned amenities.

So, came July of 2021 and I was very excited to begin the job. The position requires the holder managing the front desk in the assigned dorm building. The RD was required to hire, train, and oversee student desk assistants to work at the front desk. 

I begin to hire and assemble my student staff, it was very difficult as I had no senior staff with me as the one who was assigned to my area quit before the year started. I had to run almost everything on my own in the beginning. 

The first month, I get called to my what should have been my boss’s boss office. Upon arrival, I am told I am on probation due to an sexual harassment allegation from what I thought was a friend who came over to my apartment to hangout. She wasn’t title ix so she could not tell me what exactly the allegations were. I left her office in disbelief  and shock. but nothing came out of it as I was told, the complaint, my former friend chose not to move forward the case with title ix office. It was considered the case be closed at that point. She sent me a text, asking her to never contact her again and then she moved to the other side of campus to work as a desk assistant at one of the dorm buildings on that side of campus. I never responded to her text. 

The next couple months went by relatively easy, everyone got along with each other. The department hired a new boss for me though him and I didn’t see eye-to-eye on things. It wasn’t due to any underlined allegations, but simply due to a difference in management style. he ended up getting fired in January 2022 for work performance reasons. 

It was then going into the semester of the spring of 2022 I began having issues with my desk assistants. Some of them weren’t doing simple things and tasks  that I trained them on and instructed them to do multiple times. I would often have to threaten them with write ups for failure to execute their job functions. Keep in mind. I was a student myself in my senior year trying to do what I needed to pass all of my classes and graduate. It was very stressful and taking a toll on my mental health.

Finally, while at my internship off campus, I receive an email from the assistant director of housing, informed me that that due to new allegations of sexual harassment, racial discrimination, and another issue, that I totally forgot about, I was to be placed on suspension with pay immediately pending investigation of the sexual harassment and racial discrimination allegations. 

Fast-forward a few days after that initial email I am asked to report to the assistant director of housing office to have a meeting regarding these allegations and dis suspension overall. Upon arrival to her office, she again informed she get informed me of the allegation. It was at this point she informed me that she was Going to terminate me based off an incident that I had with scheduling one of our RAs to work at their mandatory desk hours that they have to work for their contract when they were out of town. This was solely by accident and I owned up to it, and the RA himself accepted my apology for the error. It was at this moment I chose to resign from my position to which she accepted without hesitation. Then, it appeared that she tried to get into confess to the allegations to which they included, staring at one of my female, desk  assistant’s breasts, making another female desk assistant uncomfortable because I was always there when she was there even know the hours she worked, was during in my office hours. After a mild heated discussion, she gave me three days to move out of my apartment And that concluded my nearly 2 years of service to the housing department at my university keep in mind I had no formal allegations of any kind nor any write ups for a bad work performance before I became a residence director. This decision to terminate me was most definitely made in an attempt to cover the department should informations the allegations become viral.

Had I not had my girlfriend to move in with as she lived in the city, the threat of me being homeless was very real. Nothing came of the allegations after my resignation. I did not hear anything from the universities title IX office, nor did I hear from the office of student conduct regarding the racial discrimination allegations. They simply vanished when I tended my resignation. I graduated without incident and now working a full-time job making over 50 grand a year. however, these allegations are still taking a toll on my Mental health, and I’m considering visiting a therapist.

Sorry for the grammar errors as I am on mobile. 

tl;dr: the employees whom I hired made false allegations against me, because I threatened to write them up or fire them for not doing simple aspects that their job requires. retaliation. And my supervisor took their side in an possible attempt to do damage control Should the allegations become viral on social media.",Forever_Sunlight,t2_14lmgj,0.94,179,22

99,12daegv,2023-04-06,MensRights,I am so so very tired from the overtime I need to work because of women in the teams I work with who aren't functioning. I'm working until midnight day after day and into the weekend week after week. It's all a lie. Almost no woman I work with who has a demanding position actually works. I do it all,"Such women have the degree (I have it too) or a title in the email signature three-four words long.  Equal, no? Well no. Most of the time, almost always, she won't have a clue on how to do the work her job requires. They will spread confident statements that will sound knowledgeable but if you actually know what they are talking about you will know it's complete nonsense - mistakes and fabrications - they are simply making it up (instead of simply looking it up). It becomes obvious to you after a while that they see their competence not as being skillful, experienced and as a result very effective - but as being good at throwing around the right ""buzz sentences"" to make it look as if they are someone you can trust with that job. They will send you their ""completed task"" and it will almost always be half baked. You will need to do your share - and 50% or more of theirs, you will need to spend more time on fixing problems they created (by never asking how something is done and instead ""throwing something""), and then you will find out that while they know you are leaning over your computer at 10 pm working to fix it, they are out of office.

These ""a woman can do anything a man can"" women, holding ""same position as a man"", simply create a facade, a theater show. Mostly the only thing equal to a man they have is the job title and degree - they don't actually have the knowledge, know how to do the job or put in the effort needed, rather, the ""equal number of women"" in such positions is made possible by men doing their own 100% and then 50% of the women's work.

This is the reality of it all. Not all women in these positions are like that - absolutely not! I worked with bright, hard-working, responsible, knowledgeable women (""knowledgeable"" means: being responsible enough to spend time looking for all the needed knowledge and making sure you really understand it, instead of relying on mumbling something and on someone else ""taking care of it""), who will hold their end of the pole with you and won't let go until it's in place, but they were a rare sight. In nine out of ten cases, it would be sleepless nights, no weekends, to do the woman's part and then some (as for men, my experience was that they do their best - each according to his capacity. If they're not holding their end it's because their mother is in hospital, not because they don't want to \[edit: come to think of it, a slouchy man in these responsible roles just gets replaced as soon as everyone have time to breath again. Maybe knowing this pushes men to deliver while women might get the opposite message - we need you for the body count so as long as you don't shoot a missile at the office you won't get replaced\]. And if men don't know something they just say it and ask, instead of inventing nonsense that create problems that you need to then solve.

You will be given no chance to defend yourself. Testimony from other parties proving your innocence is irrelevant.  

No matter what lengths you go to in order to make sure you are covered in the event of a false allegations is also irrelevant.

I have 3 teenage daughters. I was raised by a single mother. I respect everyone until they individually acted in a way that does not warrant that level of respect.. Men, women, somewhere in the middle it doesn't matter. Specifically in the workplace. 

I know where the lines are. I do not text female coworkers from my personal phone. If I have to text them outside of standard business hours, I use my work phone. 

Before I send a text, I take the time to think how each text could be interpreted when all context is removed. This applies to emails, face to face interactions, everything. 

I make a point to never to be alone with female coworker. Ever. Whether it's a corporate sponsored event or not, I never want to be in a he said/she said situation. Err on the side of caution. Always.  

The MeToo movement reemphasized the importance of being extra conscious with regards to women in general, specifically women coworkers. Especially when you are in a position of leadership. 

Turns out, none of that matters. 10+ years without so much as a blip on HRs radar, I was terminated for inappropriate behavior. I was accused of telling my administrative assistant I was going to fuck her. The event where I allegedly said  this, I didn't even attend. Come to find out (because I have friends in HR as well as friends that work with her husband) her husband thought we were ""getting to close"" so he told his wife to either get me fired, quit, or he was going to kick her out. He even went and bragged about it to people he apparently did not know I knew.   I will get to how this had already come back to haunt him in a bit. 

In the end none of it mattered. I was terminated on the spot. No severance, no pension, just ""mail us all your equipment and fuck off"". 

Luckily the industry I work in is huge, but very tight-knit. Word traveled fast despite HRs best efforts to say I was terminated because I did not agree with the RTO policy. (There was no RTO policy)

I'm not trying to toot my own horn, but I am well known in the industry. Just about everyone (thay matters) saw through this the moment they caught wind of it and since my non-compete and non-solicit were voided, it ultimately turned out to be a blessing in disguise, but I am still having trouble getting past 1 thing.

How can a man with a spotless record, multiple testimony from others that not only I would never say that but I WASNT EVEN AT THE EVENT THIS ALLEGEDLY TOOK PLACE get terminated because of a single unsubstantiated allegations?

When I read stories about professional athletes of celebrities who were ultimately blacklisted due to false allegations I always thought surely there is more to the story. 

Not anymore. 

TL,DR; I am struggling to come to terms that your career, character, integrity can be destroyed by a single allegation. Everything else is irrelevant.  Proof you weren't at said event means nothing. If a woman accuses you of something in the workplace or not. Corporate sponsored event or not, you're done. 

Imagine how that conversation went with my daughters? Without a doubt the hardest thing I have done in my life even though they know I do not act or talk that way. 

How do you come to terms with this and ultimately get past it? Frankly, I am terrified to work with women. I work in a male-dominated industry, but my point still stands. No matter what lengths you go to to insulate yourself from potential allegations, it ultimately doesn't make a difference. 1 accusation of saying something I didn't say at an event I have proof I never attended is all it takes. 

How do you accept this and move forward?

I can’t take you seriously if the word entitlement isn’t paired with responsibility. Start explaining what you are responsible for. 

I don’t care if you wear a bra. Why is this still a thing ? Do what you want. 

I don’t need to hear anything related to your reproductive cycle, we are not a couple so why do you feel like sharing publicly. Sharing is not caring. Your body is your business. 

If you take the time to creat list and be thoughtful do it silently. Telling others about the emotional labor you endured takes away from any generosity you supposedly offered. 

If women are still too sexualized it’s because too many of your sisters are looking for  a short cut. Deal with them, not me. 

If a man shares a thoughts or a feeling let him finish it. Talking isn’t a competitive sport. Emotions are real and not icons in your chat app. Let a man express himself  once in a while. And listen once in a while. 

And lastly, if men are so bad why do you glom onto them as if they are owed to you. No man owes you anything, least of all a relationship if he isn’t ready for one. Or if you are not the one.

In reality, women are compensated *more* than men for *less* work, and a stronger argument can be made for *men* being the ones who work more for less. 

- women receive more tax benefits despite paying an equal individual tax rate

- women benefit from early pension ages, which men must pay for

- women receive more healthcare funding, despite living longer

- the court system favors women

- the education system favors women, and women receive more scholarships

- employment laws favor women

- there are more social and welfare programs available for women

meanwhile, men must do more work, and for less

- in many countries, men provide free labor via conscription/national service

- in many countries, men have a higher pension age, meaning they work longer to pay for women's early retirement

- men receive less tax benefits and social programs

- men's health receives less funding

- men have less access to public housing and homeless shelters

- men perform unpaid manual and physical labor

- men perform jobs with the highest rate of death

I generally always said lines like:

- “big shout out for my man that worked hard for this sports event 

- “ you are my man for this job “

- “my man “

 You get the idea ..

And keep in mind that if it was up to me I would use the same terms even when it comes for female co-workers (but it would be sound absolutely like  sexisms and boy-man culture)

For example:  imagine if I would use the exact same terms for women! 
I would loose my job the next day  but at the same time here where lies the paradox.

B) when instead it comes to have meetings with females co-workers I never use those terms when it come to females , because I would definitely call out by HR, so I always address them by names,.

Or

“Big shout out  to Grace for the amazing effort and work “

I am scared about saying anything because it will jeopardize my working relationships, but these comments really irritate me because I know that someone is there making the world a worse place. It puts me in a bad mood and affects my work something awful.

I try to ignore this person as much as possible when it comes to non work things but since the IM system is required for work it is difficult to ignore.

I'm half blowing off some steam, half looking for advice because I can't help getting annoyed when I have to deal with these people every day.

Here's some of the comments, from memory:

* Someone retells ""sudo make me a sandwich"" (xkcd.com /149) in text form, changing characters to ""boy"" and ""girl"" just for the sake of having characters. Followed by angry comments how its sexist because of the mere mention of a girl and a sandwich must be a reference to the old trope, with support from two others directed at the story teller.

* ""Why do the male programmers stare at me, they're weird and disgusting"" - totally untrue, she works in a separate room and wears loud boots causing attention when entering the programming area.

* She tells a joke involving a doctor and a patient, and someone comments on the patent, using the pronoun ""he"". She proceeds to have a hissy fit saying ""funny how you assume it's a man, cause only men can die right"". This one enraged me because 1. of her over-reaction and 2. I don't see a problem with men identifying with a male character. It's sexist to force someone to override their natural identification. More women characters represented in media, movies and games = good. Forcing someone's self identification to be something it's not = bad.

* And finally, in my opinion, the worst was when my (male) boss said ""someone's got a small penis"" in reference to someone revving a car really hard outside, she had a rant about how ""only men drive cars right"" and completely ignored that the comment was an occurrence of casual male body shaming. This shows she doesn't really care about equality, if that wasn't already clear.

Since this is my first job out of college, I don't really know how to handle it apart from trying to ignore everyone and distance myself. This puts me at a disadvantage because of the social life that the company promotes is supposed to be good for networking. I might just look for somewhere else in another industry, it's really not worth working in the corruption of the entertainment industry.

I also want to point out to her credit that there was one instance that her outrage was arguably warranted (Someone immediately asked to ""speak to the manager"" because a woman in our company picked up the phone, and although the story was told second hand I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt), however she ruined it by directing to the men ""that's for all of you who think sexism doesn't exist anymore"", and taking the default stance that all men treat women as second class citizens.

EDIT: Thanks for all of the advice. I will keep recording these statements if they continue the way they have been. I will ignore the comments, and not let them bother me, by assuring myself that my records can and will have a positive effect eventually, while trying to be a valuable employee and nothing else.",throwaway85930458,t2_ogtxu,0.92,48,66

That is not the point, it's the principle. If we get paid the same, women would still be receiving more just because they are women and for no other reason, not because they are better, not because they are smarter. Imagine you being paid 1000 and a woman being paid 1000 and she still receiver more due to special privileges. Women are given advantages all the time for whatever reason just because they are women. Now imagine if men were receiving something entirely based on their gender, and on top of that, that being institution and repetitive, do you imagine the outrage? Isn't that literally discrimination on the workplace? I don't complain that women receive special remunition but that men do not. Men never do. In anything.

125,9blgkc,2018-08-30,MensRights,"I'm tired of women who get pregnant, disappear from the company and when they get back expect everything to be the same while men have to bust their asses working...","Yes, it sounds sexist, but I don't really give a f* at this point.

We work on a competitive field, and I've noticed that marernity leave is treated as a ""get out of work for a few months"" jolly card and many of these women come back after 5 or 6 months and expect to have their careers untouched. I'm not talking about being able to have paternity leave (which men have), I'm talking about the indifference to men when it comes to career responsibility: women can drop everything and disappear untouched. Men don't.

In my experience, men cannot just take 1 or 2 months of holidays and expect nothing's going to change for them at the job. Don't get me wrong, I know having children isn't holidays, but it's still a choice, just as would be going on vacation.

What's even worse: if I want a vacation, I have to schedule it and it needs to be approved. If a woman gets pregnant, she's (and rightfully so) under no obligation to schedule it or getting it approved, she would just one day drop into the office and announce it, and everything and everyone will have to re-shift priorities for her.

Equality is equality. We deserved to be treated the same way, not be expected to carry the company's weight while women keep going in and out for this issue. We had 6 different women disappearing in the last 2 years and it's been hell. I almost couldn't even go in vacation to cover for shifts, and I'm not the only one. How is this fair?

What I'm trying to say is, while I'm all for giving women the current set of rights they have in regards to having children, shouldn't the companies give men some sort of similar treatment or benefits that would reward them if they *don't* want to have children but still want something else from life?

But hey, try telling a woman who went on maternity leave for 5 months that she no longer holds the same position in the company and it's hell... sexist, misogynist and unfair. Sure, like the guy who had to cover for her, who now has to step back or get fired, so that mommy can get back on that horse!

This isn't the middle ages: women can *decide* to have children, and they have to *choose* to give stuff up, just like I would have to give stuff up if I *decided* to go on a 3 months cruise. But no, it's treated as an untouchable right of the human being. Besides, who cares, there's always some men around to do the work for them while they are away, right?

And don't even question it, otherwise you are a misogynistic prick... Equality is equality. You wanted the same rights, so deal with it: if you choose to disappear to have children, then you also choose to let your career go for that time, and don't expect to be treated like it never happened when you come back!

130,14p55pz,2023-07-03,MensRights,"Debunking the ""Gender Pay Gap""","Copied from the [original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TraditionalMuslims/comments/14p3dwq/debunking_the_gender_pay_gap/).

So I didn't think I needed to debunk this as it's been done a million times before. However, it's come to my attention that apparently some still believe it. So, just to have an easy-to-reference, codified treatise on the issue, I'm writing this piece to utterly decimate this commonly propagated liberal trope.

Mainstream media presents [articles like this](https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-wage-pay-gap-charts-2017-3) that claim there is a pay gap between men and women, and that it's on the sole basis of gender. While it is true that men tend to earn more money than women, it is absolutely false that it's due to gender bias in favor of men (if anything, it's actually in favor of women). The problem with the statistics shown is that they only take into account median yearly salaries without accounting for any other confounding variables that may be skewing the data. For example, if I told you that the more people drown the more often ice cream is sold, would you take that to mean that ice cream causes people to drown? No, you'd probably say that it's because of ice cream sales increasing in the summer when it's hot, which is simultaneously when people go swimming more, thereby increasing the likelihood of drownings to happen; this shared commonality (i.e. the heat) is a confounding variable.

For the so-called ""gender pay gap"", here are the confounding variables:

1. This statistic does not account for what types of jobs are being worked, as **men choose higher-paying jobs**.
   * [*Source 1.*](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.1120.0757) *Demonstrates how women choose different jobs than men because they value and/or prioritize different things than men (e.g. better work-life balance). Because of this, the jobs they prefer tend to be lower-paying.*
   * [*Source 2.*](https://academic.oup.com/oep/article-abstract/57/3/479/2361925?redirectedFrom=fulltext) *Same as Source 1, but also found that ""job satisfaction of men increases with additional earnings while that of women does not"" (p. 486).*
   * [*Source 3.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719) *Landmark study; displays evidence that men choose higher-paying jobs. The more egalitarian/feminist a country is, the fewer women choose careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (i.e. traditionally male-dominated roles). Giving greater career choice to women increases (apparent) gender disparities within the workforce.*
   * [*Source 4.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2525981) *Cited over 11,600 times. Demonstrated very directly that women choose jobs that are lower-paying, and that women are NOT being paid less to do equal work; and this was in 1973, almost 50 years ago. Please note that any discrimination found thereafter is really just residual unaccounted variability rather than actual discrimination per se, as detailed in the conclusion.*
   * [*Source 5.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243210361475) *So ignoring the ideological bullshit that's indirectly being pushed, it demonstrates clearly that women choose different jobs than men and that it is solely due to their own choice; and that the only time women don't choose traditionally female jobs over male jobs is when they're essentially forced to take the male job.*
      * *Interestingly enough, this supports the findings of* [*this study here*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719) *(which was a MASSIVE, catastrophic blow to the ""men and women are equal but female oppression and gender discrimination are the only reason why we aren't"" narrative); the researchers found that the more egalitarian/feministic a society is, the greater the gender differences will be (regarding what people will choose to pursue). In other words, when you give women free choice to pursue whatever they want, they will willfully choose occupations/education/life goals that will only increase the gender gap between men and women.*
2. The statistic does not account for **different positions within a respective field** (e.g. head/lead developer vs senior developer vs junior developer; they're all developers, but different rankings/positions). We know this because it's not possible to know the relative rankings/positions of people's careers if they don't even know what those careers are in the first place.
   * [*Source 6.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1808858) *Looked at a company from the years 1966 and 1969-1971; found no gender discrimination when accounting for all variables. States that at most, there may be gender discrimination with regards to promotion, but even this is speculative as it is not explained why this may be the case (and truth be told, we already know why this is; I will explain later on). If the concept of a gender wage gap was already being debunked/disproved back then, it definitely doesn't exist now (at least, not in favor of men anyway...).*
   * [*Source 7.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30038574) *Studies a company that was sued for ACTUALLY discriminating against women with regards to promotion, and found that there wasn't any pay differences between men and women who were given the same job/assignment. In other words, even when discriminating against women, they were still being fair about the pay.*
3. The statistic does not account for **age** (e.g. a young person may make more money than an older person in a physically-taxing field, older people in fields that would require more knowledge/wisdom to handle, etc.).
   * [*Source 8.*](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26623) *Generally speaking, workers over age 40 are only about half as likely to get a job offer as younger workers if employers know their age*
4. The statistic does not account for **job tenure** (i.e. how long someone has been working for their respective employer for).
   * [*Source 9.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122413514584) *Shows men in general have greater job tenure than women. It's decreasing overall (particularly for men) but there are various reasons for it, many of which are oftentimes advantageous from a career/monetary standpoint, which men are going to be more receptive towards since men typically prioritize money more than other aspects of a career (see Source 1).*
   * [*Source 10.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831432) *It's in the title; job tenure typically entails higher wages. In recent times, this has been changing within certain fields (hence why it's been decreasing as shown in Source 8 above), but the point still stands overall.*
5. **Men work more than women**, which implicates in the previous 2 points with men being able to develop greater job tenure and work experience. More men work full-time than women. Moreover, the term 'full-time"" means anyone working 35 hours or more (with some lowering it to 30 hours or more to further skew the stats in favor of their social agenda); this could mean anywhere from 35 hours to 135 hours per week, and I can tell you right now that the vast majority of people who are working an exorbitantly high number of hours are men, NOT women.
   * [*Source 11.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2015/time-spent-working-by-full-and-part-time-status-gender-and-location-in-2014.htm) *Statistics from the US government. Men simply work more than women, even when comparing men who work full-time to women who work full-time, and men who work part-time to women who work part-time.*
   * [*Source 12.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2019/pdf/home.pdf) *More statistics from the US government for 2019.*
      * *""Among full-time workers, those usually working at a job 35 hours or more per week, men are more likely than women to work more than 40 hours per week. In 2019, 25 percent of men who usually work full time worked 41 or more hours per week, compared with 14 percent of women. Women were more likely than men to work 35 to 39 hours per week: 10 percent of women worked such hours in 2019, while 4 percent of men did"" (p. 8).*
      * *Women were more likely to be working a part-time job than men.*
      * *""Women who worked part time made up 23 percent of all female wage and salary workers in 2019. In comparison, 11 percent of men in wage and salary jobs worked part time.""*
   * [*Source 13.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2020/pdf/home.pdf) *Even more statistics from the US government for 2020.*
      * *19.6% of men working full-time worked 41 or more hours per week, compared to only 10.2% of women who were working full-time. This means that men working full-time were nearly twice as likely as women to work 41 hours per work or more (Table 5). This coincides with* [data discussed at the 2019 G20 Summit](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---cabinet/documents/publication/wcms_713376.pdf)*.*
      * *Men working full-time were also 2.3 times more likely than women to work 60+ hour weeks: 4.3% of men worked 60 hours per week or more compared to only 1.9% of women.*
      * *Women working full-time were more than twice as likely as men to work shorter workweeks of 35 to 39 hours per week: 7.7% of full-time women worked those hours, compared to only 3.6% of men who did so.*
      * *Men working 35-39 hours per week earned only 92.4% of what women earned working those same hours ($600 median weekly earnings for men vs. $649 for women). This means there was a 7.6% gender earnings gap in favor of female workers (for that cohort), and this is BEFORE accounting for any confounding variables!!!*
      * *Women were more likely to be working a part-time job than men.*
      * *Although not reported by the BLS, it can be estimated using its data that the average workweek for full-time workers (in 2020) was 41.3 hours for women and 42.8 hours for men, meaning the average man employed full-time worked 1.5 more hours per week compared to the average woman. This adds up to men, on average, having worked an additional 78 hours per year compared to the average full-time female worker.*
      * *Some of the raw earnings gap naturally disappears by simply controlling for some of the variables. For example, women technically earned 82.3% of median male earnings for all workers working 35+ hours per week (i.e. full-time). But for those workers with a 40-hour workweek (more than three-quarters of all full-time female workers), women earned 87.4% of median male earnings, and that's after accounting for just one variable: hours worked.*
      * *For young, full-time workers aged 16-24, women earned 94.7% of the median earnings of their male counterparts. Once again, controlling for just a single important variable—age—we find that more than two-thirds of the ""gender pay gap"" disappears. There are tons of other factors like these that go unaccounted for when you hear people/the media talk about the gender pay gap. Keep this in mind from now on.*
   * [*Source 14.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2008/02/art5full.pdf) *Conducted by the US government. Looks at 12 European nations and shows that men work more than women in all of the countries studied, among many other things.*
   * [*Source 15.*](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t04.htm) *Government statistics for 2021. Men clearly work more than women.*
   * [*Source 16.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00197939211045376) *Some people may not think that men work more than women enough to help warrant the pay gap, but this paper explains otherwise (they basically accounted for the jobs being worked and how men and women vary in the number of hours worked within these specific jobs rather than ignoring the types of jobs worked).*
6. Building off the previous point, **men work more overtime**, and the gender pay gap statistic does not account for overtime pay. And if men are working more hours than women, that means that men are going to make more money from overtime which is higher than your standard base rate.
   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *This is one of my favorite studies ever. It's just so well-done and is, in my opinion, the epitome of what research is supposed to look like. It was conducted by Harvard University, and one of the authors is literally a woman (meaning there isn't any bias caused by sexism or misogyny on behalf of the authors). It demonstrates a multitude of things, but as it relates to this specific point, it shows clearly that men work more overtime than women (p. 2–3; Figure A.16, p. 85).*
7. **Men are more likely to accept overtime, and especially when presented without prior notice** (e.g. if someone had an emergency and couldn't come in, and employees are asked if they can stay, men are more likely to accept it). This means men tend to be more reliable workers overall. It's technically a separate point from the one above because the frequency of accepting overtime is different from actually working it (e.g. someone could work a lot of overtime one week and not work it at all for the next 12 weeks, vs someone who works only a few hours of overtime every week).
   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *Also shows how men are more likely to accept overtime when it's presented to them and that men in general are especially more likely to accept overtime without prior notice (p. 3; Figure 6, p. 49; Figure A.17, p. 86).*
8. **Men are less likely to have unexcused absences.**
   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *Women have more unexcused leave of absences than men (Figure 22, p. 65). This further implicates men as being more reliable workers. What's ironic is that men face harsher penalties/disciplinary measures than women (Figure 21, p. 64), contrary to popular belief.*
9. The statistic does not account for **work experience** (i.e. how long someone has been working in their respective field).
   * [*Source 18.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2535309) *In general, men have greater work experience than women (courtesy of working more than women); the timing of work experience and overall work matters a lot as well, and since men are simply working more than women, the advantages of this timing will be more apparent in men than women. This study has data directly showing that men have greater actual work experience, potential work experience, and job tenure than women (the last of which relates back to the previous numbered point).*
10. **Men do not get pregnant and are less likely to leave work for kids** (e.g. paternity leave); pregnancy forces women to stop working, which relates back to points 4, 5, 8, and 9, and men being less likely to leave work for kids also shows more dedication to work.
      * [*Source 19.*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwao.12506) *The abstract alone states ""mothers with young children have reduced their work hours four to five times more than fathers"". Some of you may say that this therefore nullifies Source 12 as supporting evidence for point 5, but it actually strengthens it because it exemplifies the gender differences that can cause a skew in the gender wage gap myth and highlights the behavioral dimorphism between the sexes. At most, it would only nullify SOME of its generalizability on a year-to-year basis, but even then, it still showcases how statistics can be skewed/misrepresented to provide a false narrative about gender discrimination that doesn't actually exist with regards to pay. Anyway, Source 13 also states similar as well due to the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) where women are far more likely to leave work/not come in, but I don't want to be redundant and keep using the same source even though it's a fantastic study.*
11. **Men are less likely to take sick days.**
      * [*Source 20.*](https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/68/5/320/4973626) *Women take more sick leave than men, even after accounting for many variables.*
      * [*Source 21.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6070205/) *The introduction alone is enough to show that women take more sick leave than men, this is undisputed and has been for decades. This study sought to determine whether there were differences in attitudes towards sick leave based on gender, and whether this contributes to women's absenteeism. They did not find much support for this, indicating that women take more sick leave regardless of societal norms and expectations.*
      * [*Source 22.*](https://journals.lww.com/joem/Abstract/2015/08000/High_Job_Demands,_Job_Strain,_and_Iso_Strain_Are.5.aspx) *Women take more sick leave due to mental health reasons than men (p. 860), with 90% of ""mental health"" reasons being either stress, mood, and/or anxiety-related.*
12. **Men are less likely to take vacation days.**
      * [*Source 23.*](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1019.5400&rep=rep1&type=pdf) *Great study that shows how women take more vacation days than men, while also discussing why it is the case. Has several other findings/key points that showcase male-female dimorphism as it relates to work and the family, and they are very interesting; they essentially prove what is already self-evident with regards to gender roles, despite what mainstream society is trying to push today.*
13. **Men are more likely to move for a job.**
      * [*Source 24.*](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol40/53/40-53.pdf) *Shows conclusively that men are more willing to move for a job. They try to say that single women are just as likely as single men to move for a job after accounting for confounding variables, but that's nonsense because one of the variables was essentially how well they like the job (i.e. ""job characteristics""), when the location of a job doesn't have an impact on how much the job itself should or should not be liked (and if any of you researchers disagree, you will need to account for the Halo Effect to fully make sure that distance isn't what's making them view those same ""job characteristics"" as distasteful enough for them to not want to move). It's as if they're trying to say that jobs should cater to women by changing how they operate so women will like them better, rather than simply just acknowledge that women do not want to move for work as much as men. In fact, it's not even as if they're saying that, they literally suggest it lmao! It's very gynocentric when you look at it. The reason why they say this is because they do not want to admit that the gender gap is literally caused by women's own personal preferences, because then that would mean that the gender gap is normal, natural, and that women willfully make the choices that cause the gender gap, essentially nullifying any narrative that women are victims of oppression and that the gender differences that exist between men and women are caused by men and women ACTUALLY being different. This last point really irks the ideologues. In addition, it would place accountability over the gender gap on women, and women absolutely cannot handle having accountability.*
      * [*Source 25.*](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/app/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/GD_ResearchReport_MetroMovers_Draft4-1.pdf) *Literally the same thing as the previous source (including all of the progressive diatribes that I dismantled) but with a massive online job search website.*
      * [*Source 26.*](https://web.stanford.edu/~niederle/CEN_discrimination.pdf) *This one has some progressivism within it as well, but ignoring that, we find that any discrimination against women isn't due to them on the sole basis of them being women, but rather because of beliefs over how well they would do the job. In fact, it shows that people are MORE likely to favor women as job candidates when a negative belief is ascribed to a woman rather than when it is ascribed without the gender being stated. In other words, gender discrimination isn't gender discrimination at all but rather performance discrimination, which is the definition of a meritocracy (i.e. a system in which people are judged based on their merit/how good they are at their job, rather than characteristics unrelated to said job/merit).*

18. **Men are more interested in jobs that are scalable**; men are more interested in physical things, while women are more interested in jobs that deal with people. The former is scalable, the latter is not; that means Elon Musk is able to service millions of people with Tesla whereas Mrs. Johnson is only able to teach a class of 30 students per year. This point is separate from the first point because scalability relates to potential growth/earning, and based on the laws of chance, you're more likely to find some major hit successes in professions that are scalable rather than unscalable.

19. **Men are more likely to ask for a raise.**
      * [*Source 45.*](https://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/16689) *Men are more likely to ask for a raise; the only exception is when women enter managerial positions (i.e. are put in male roles, basically). It also shows that women are basically worse at negotiating than men (""less successful"" = euphemism for being worse at).*
      * [*Source 46.*](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1994) *Women are only as likely as men to ask for a raise when they are explicitly told they can negotiate for one. I can tell you right now that most jobs rarely ever directly tell its employees that they can freely ask for a raise lol.*
      * [*Source 47.*](https://escholarship.org/content/qt9978v172/qt9978v172.pdf?t=omys3w) *Women are less comfortable engaging in salary negotiations, they're less likely to negotiate salaries overall, and they're not as good at it as men (the researchers don't word this last point this way because it angers feminists, but that's the gist of it). There are many other reasons that they go into as well.*
20. **Men are typically more aggressive/competitive in their mindset and attitudes regarding work** which helps them climb the corporate ladder more (e.g. you make more off commission in sales because you close more sales due to being more competitive).
      * [*Source 48.*](https://archive.bio.org/sites/default/files/docs/toolkit/Why%20Men%20Still%20Get%20More%20Promotions%20than%20Women_HBR%20article.pdf) *Upon reading this, you find that women are essentially not as willing to do what it takes to climb the corporate ladder; the report says that therefore the entire civilizational structure should change to favor women, but that's just ridiculous. Why not just admit that women are not as willing to hyperfocus on their careers in the same way as men? Why not just admit that women don't do it because they simply don't want to sacrifice other areas of their life for a career? Why not just finally admit that women are different from men? They can't. And that's a problem for BOTH genders.*
21. **The top people are always going to be men due to the variability hypothesis.**
      * [*Source 49.*](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/493921) *Men vary greater than women; when seeing any of the extremes, men are more likely to be represented on both ends. That means the most successful people in the world are going to overwhelmingly be men, and the most unsuccessful dregs of society will also be men. This represents a problem with feminist thinking because they want ""equality"" when it comes to powerful, important, and successful positions in society and say that a lack thereof in these top positions are due to sexism and discrimination (and that therefore all of men and society need to just give women these positions to ""make it fair""), but they will never talk about the men at the lowest ends of society or talk about equalizing that. I'm not saying they should become homeless criminals and whatnot either (rather they should focus on decreasing the amount of men that are disenfranchised here; but they'll never do that since they would have to admit that men aren't oppressors and would have to actually acknowledge the plights of men), I'm just saying there's a double standard here whereby women want the rights and privileges of both sexes with the responsibilities of neither, all the while blaming men for any (and all) of their own shortcomings and faults.*
      * [*Source 50.*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886913003036) *Men vary more than women yet also tend to be better on average on measures of creativity.*
      * [*Source 51.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variability_hypothesis#:~:text=The%20variability%20hypothesis%2C%20also%20known,most%20traits%20than%20females%20do.) *For those who still don't get it, here's a Wikipedia article since they tend to describe things fairly simply and succinctly.*

Just to really drive home the point, I quote the official statement of the US Department of Labor after having a massive [study](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2019/pdf/home.pdf) conducted for them:

>**This study leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a multitude of factors and that the raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action. Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers.**

And even ignoring the technical research aspects, just think about it like this: If a woman were to do the same job as a man for less pay, only women would get hired because that would be CHEAP LABOR. And for those who don't know, there's a whole sexism argument that claims men get hired more easily than men (which also isn't necessarily true either, but that's a separate discussion).

There isn't a single statistician who isn't braindead, let alone competent, who takes the statistics presented about the gender pay gap myth at face value when drawing conclusions. It's only after you account for all the variables available can you really begin to extrapolate true causality, and even then it is still weak with these types of statistical analyses anyway since it's virtually impossible to account for every variable that exists *and* have a full consensus for data rather than a statistic that has a much smaller sample size. Plus, when it comes to statistical analyses like this, you're ultimately seeing how things relate to one another (i.e. correlated) rather than seeing how they directly influence/cause something. The only way to truly test for causality is by running actual experiments with strong controls in place (which is nigh on impossible to do in situations like these). If you take a statistics class or two, you'll learn about this stuff more in-depth. Multivariate analyses are pretty much always better than univariate ones (when drawing final conclusions from, anyway), and it's due to reasons like this where society perpetuates the gender pay gap myth as a social dogma.

If women can do anything men can do (and ""do it better""), then why are they still supposedly ""oppressed""? Why are they still the victims? And why do they need government legislation to mandate ""gender equality"" in order to achieve it? If they were really the same as men (i.e. ""equal"") in all these regards, wouldn't perfect equality naturally occur based on merit alone? It doesn't make sense, and it's simply because it's just not true. Men and women aren't the same, and we won't ever be the same. That doesn't mean we shouldn't be treated fairly—equity over equality, always—but this myth needs to die once and for all.

132,iyiami,2020-09-23,MensRights,May have lost a job because I am male,"For context: I am a 25 year old male. Fresh out of grad school and planning to apply to physio school this year. I applied for a job as a physiotherapy assistant because with my kinesiology degree, minor in rehabilitation, years of relevant work experience, master's degree studying how pain effects movement, and being a certified personal trainer since I turned 18 I figured I should be plenty qualified to teach people exercises. I also thought it would help me get a good reference for physio school

I get an interview for the job and it goes great. They basically decide based on my resume that I'm a perfect fit before I even go to the interview. I go in and sign the paperwork and they tell me come in on Monday for training. They would like me to primarily be a physio assistant but also run to the front once in a while if there is a phone call or something. 

I walk in on Monday and the lady who runs the front desk who I am supposed to be shadowing tells me she is surprised that they hired me because, as someone who also has to do some work at the front desk, it's strange that they didn't hire a woman because women are so much better at it than men. Weird start but whatever. I spend the whole day working with her, learning how to bill people's insurance, greeting people as they come in, answering the phone, calling patients to make sure they didn't forget about their appointments, etc. I was attentive, I asked questions to clarify things, didn't make any mistakes, overall I thought I had a very good first day. She tells me come back in on Wednesday for more front desk training. Cool. 

Today they text me first thing in the morning and ask if I will come in an hour and a half early. Sure! I can do that! So I go in early and the head physiotherapist sits me down in one of the treatment rooms and explains that whoever is at the front desk is the face of the company. When people come in or call it's the first person they interact with and the person at the desk is responsible for keeping those clients coming back instead of going somewhere else. Without the right person at the front desk the business will fail. 

They decided that I am more than qualified enough for being a physiotherapy assistant and they bet that I don't even need any training I could just start. However, they need someone who is also good on the front desk so they have changed their mind and they will be hiring someone else instead and they sent me home. 

On my way out I tell the lady at the front desk that they said I'm not a good fit for working at reception and she reiterates that it's true because I'm not a female and laughs as I walk out the door. 

Did I just lose my job for being the wrong gender? I thought everything went so well especially since I was hired primarily to treat patients. Then I get called in and totally blind sided that I'm not a good fit for the position even though I thought everything went so well. Am I being overly analytical? Or did I actually just lose my job because I'm a man? 

TL:DR: Started a job as a physiotherapy assistant. Office manager makes a comment on my first day it's weird that they didn't choose a woman. Next day find out they changed their mind about hiring me and I'm fired",Thepolander,t2_xjcpj,0.98,396,55

134,n0jarm,2021-04-28,MensRights,All female management and HR forced me out of the company after reporting harassment,"This happened three years ago at a small company and it still has been weighing on me. It was one of those ""we're one big family"" tech companies who prided itself on having beer in the fridge and a ""great culture"". 

The management structure above me was my lead (female), mid level manager (female), direct manager (female), and department head (male). The HR department was 3 people (all female). For what it's worth, I am also an ethnic minority and all the women in management were white women. 

Myself, a female colleague, and another male colleague were all up for a promotion. The only one that walked away with a promotion was my female colleague, despite myself and my male colleague being there far longer (I actually interviewed and made the call to hire the person who was promoted). The company had a formal list of criteria needed for a promotion, so I created a list with evidence for every bullet point and sent it to my manager. She refused to even glance at it and told me my accomplishments were not relevant. Weeks later I pleaded with her to go over this document and discuss my career goals. She flipped out on me, called me all kinds of names, and then stormed off. 

I went to the head of the department and explained what had happened. He was shocked at the behavior and had no idea what was going on in the department. He scheduled a meeting with the three of us and she tried to lay into me again, but instead her boss chewed her out for unprofessional behavior. He then saw my list of accomplishments and decided I was definitely in line for a promotion and I was promoted not long after, along with my male colleague. I thought it was over. Boy was I wrong.

A few months later the department head left the company and was replaced by a female department head (so the entire management structure was female). My boss held a grudge and it was open season on me now. But this time she stepped over the line and harassed me over email with direct language about a disability I have. This is blatantly illegal so I went to HR. 

They immediately defended her and tried to gaslight me. Everything I said they tried to counter, until I presented them with the harassment in writing. I stood firm and knew my rights and they backed down. What transpired after that was 6 months of retaliation (I spoke to a lawyer and he said there's not much you can do until they fire you). 

Constant belittling, talking bad about me to other coworkers, turning people against me. Every 1 on 1 meeting we had was recorded (something she never did to anyone else). Every time I pushed this up the all female chain of command it fell on deaf ears. Eventually I left the company, just like they wanted. My position was filled by my boss's female friend. I am told by someone that still works there she had been badmouthing me behind my back for over 2 years.

Keep in mind this is a company where other female employees openly said they discriminated against men. They host and sponsor feminist events. They openly say their pride themselves on hiring women. 

When I reported my manager for harassment, it was me against a clique that openly made it clear where they stand, and that stance was firmly against men. This just showed me that harassment against men is real, and when the deck is stacked against you there is little that can be done.",LivingVideo,t2_347f3m8v,0.99,1998,213

**WWI**

&#x200B;

>Beginning on 23 October 1916, deportation went into effect as official policy in all of German-occupied Belgium.

&#x200B;

>Belgian mayors had no interest in sending the best workers to Germany. Many mayors simply refused. Several were arrested and fined for noncompliance.105 In towns where mayors provided lists, the Germans had unintentionally given them wide latitude in the use o f their new power. Because the Germans provided no specific test of “unemployed,” the term was open to liberal interpretation. As a result, the lists given to the Germans routinely included the chronically ill, criminals, and derelicts. Most o f those deported in the first weeks were physically unfit Meanwhile many unemployed ablebodied men were shielded from deportation by mayors, who made them special constables or special members of the CN.

&#x200B;

>Likewise, men who were only recently employed were assumed to have been hired only to avoid deportation and were taken anyway. Men who were unable to prove that they were too young or too old were deported.

&#x200B;

>The most complete account of the selection process was a report given to the American minister in Brussels on 17 January by foreign service officer Christian H. Herter. According to this report, the 4 January deportation from Mechelen (seat of the Cardinal o f Belgium) took three days. On the first day all males between seventeen and fifty-five presented themselves at a central station: “ ... each man must bear his identity card and \[was\] allowed to bring with him any documentary evidence which \[could\] go to prove that he \[was\] actually employed or unfit for hard labor.”

&#x200B;

>Nonetheless, impressive numbers of men were conscripted. Official figures given to the Belgian Parliament for total deportees indicated 58,500 from the Central Government and a further 62,155 sent to building projects in the War Zone. The official German figures vary. One set, which take no account of deportations from the War Zone and run only from 23 October 1916 until 20 January 1917, gives a total of 58,432. According to other figures the total number was 61,000. The official 1928 Reichstag report sets the total at 66,150. Although there was disagreement about the exact number, all estimates fall within this eight thousand deportee variance.

&#x200B;

**WWII**

&#x200B;

>During the spring of 1941 the occupation government began to force changes in Belgian social legislation to make contract labor in Germany more appealing. The first change was lengthening the work day in coal mines to 10 hours so that fewer miners were required.

&#x200B;

>Hendriks held that all men had the obligation to work and that if there was insufficient work in Belgium they should emigrate to Germany.

&#x200B;

>Individuals who refused compulsory work within Belgium were classified as “asocials” and those who stopped reporting to the job site or left Germany before their contracts ran out were classified as “contract breakers.” In unilateral violation o f all the 1940 agreements Hendriks saw to it that all “contract breakers” and “asocials” were refused unemployment benefits. The only way “asocials” could be rehabilitated was for them to volunteer for work in Germany. Theirs was the choice between penal labor in Belgium or “voluntary” work in Germany.

&#x200B;

>During the next two years Belgian labor was conscripted in three phases. The first, a short-lived continuation o f “combing out” with compulsory deportation, ran from fall 1942 into mid spring o f 1943. By the beginning o f 1943, however, the pool o f skilled workers had begun to run dry. In the wake o f the February defeat at Stalingrad, the Germans began to revamp the Arbeitseinsatz, shifting from combing out to simply conscripting Belgian workers by age group. Men bom in 1920 and 1921 were drafted for one year’s mandatory service in Germany. Initially combing out and birth year conscription overlapped, but this overlap ended on 6 September 1943, and in a virtual return of First World War methods workers were dragooned by age. Each stage was more nakedly compulsory and less successful than its predecessor.

&#x200B;

>The peoples they respected least suffered the greatest deportation o f their female populations. The largest percentage o f women deportees (51% o f the total) came from the despised Soviet Union. The lowest percentage (3% of all deportees) came from Germany’s former ally Hungary.  
>  
>15,000 Belgian women volunteered for labor in Germany. Later, a further 21,826 were conscripted, so that women comprised 11% of all Belgian deportees. In contrast to men who were sought for their skilled labor, most women were unskilled: their labor was less sought after and relatively poorly paid. The overwhelming majority went into domestic service. There was also a sizeable contingent in the textile industry.",SamaelET,t2_711hdpbk,0.9,16,3
136,ys0kj,2012-08-24,MensRights,The sexism coming from the women in my workplace is astounding.,"We were having our Friday lunch together in the office, as we do every week, and a conversation came up about the new CEO of Yahoo and how she was pregnant but not taking maternity leave. I decided to note that the husband could take it instead, which I thought would be a great idea since she's clearly got lots of work ahead of her.

In comes a comment from an early 20-something, ""It's not the same."" ""Yeah, it is,"" I replied, casually and informatively. ""It's not at *all* the same,"" she responded.

The conversation quickly shifted at that point, which was for the best. Had we stayed on that topic, I think tensions would've run incredibly high. That was about 6 hours ago now, but the moment still resounds in my mind angrily and with contempt. That she, an unwed, child-free woman would so quickly dismiss the value of the bond between a father and his newborn child repulses me. This kind of attitude is something I've dealt with for at least the last 2 years at my job.

Firstly, let's glance at Wikipedia's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational\_fatality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_fatality) page: no gender imbalance is mentioned, that means there is none, right?

2/

Luckily the BoLS provides all it's data in one neat overview page: [https://www.bls.gov/iif/fatal-injuries-tables.htm](https://www.bls.gov/iif/fatal-injuries-tables.htm), and we can easily spot what we are looking for: **Distribution of fatal injury events by gender of worker** ([HTML](https://www.bls.gov/charts/census-of-fatal-occupational-injuries/distribution-fatal-events-by-gender.htm)).

>Roadway incidents Men: 24%  
>  
>Roadway incidents Women: 25%   
>  
>Falls, slips, trips Men: 17%  
>  
>Falls, slips, trips Women:  11%

Hurray, there is essentially no imbalance between men and women workplace fatalities! 

Wait, there is something fishy going on in here. Those percentages add up to 100, the graph does not show **distribution of fatal injury events by gender,** it shows **distribution of fatal injury events by category per each gender.**

3/ 

That's wired. Let's look at race. There is the **Number of fatal work injuries by race or ethnic origin** ([HTML](https://www.bls.gov/charts/census-of-fatal-occupational-injuries/number-of-fatal-work-injuries-by-race-or-ethnic-origin.htm)) page and it shows exactly what you would expect: 

>White: 3,103  
>  
>African American: 653  
>  
>Hispanic: 1,130  
>  
>\[...\]

4/

No other gender categories in the overview page. Maybe searching for ""gender"" will help? Indeed, Google returns data for **Homicides and other workplace assaults by gender in 2019** ([HTML](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2021/homicides-and-other-workplace-assaults-by-gender-in-2019.htm))

>Homicides Men: 7.5%  
>  
>Homicides Women: 20.1%  
>  
>All other fatal incidents Men: 92.5%  
>  
>All other fatal incidents Women: 79.9%

Again, no actual gender comparison, just relative numbers. Is this deliberate? 

5/ 

Finally, this page contains a tidbit of information: **News Release - 2021 data** ([HTML](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.nr0.htm))  

>Worker characteristics

>\[...\]

>\- Women made up **8.6 percent** of all workplace fatalities but represented 14.5 percent of intentional injuries by a person in 2021. 

What do they mean by ""but represented 14.5 percent of intentional injuries by a person""? That still makes 75.5% of victims male. What is going on in here?",griii2,t2_3gqqu,0.92,66,11

Need some love and guidance.","I was falsely accused of rape some time ago, I know it was consensual - they admitted it was consensual, they stayed the night, and then texted for a second date a couple days later. A week goes by and then she texts me claiming I had ripped the condom off (which I didn't) and got a rape kit done. I lawyered up, the police contacted me and I didn't say anything. The police ended up not charging me. I thought it was over. But no, she then went to my regulatory profession, I'm a nurse, and they charged me with acting unprofessional and suspended me. This was absurd and I had all my exes write in to say I was a good boyfriend and respecting when it came to sex. They held a kangaroo court hearing and nodded their heads in agreement with everything she said. My profession threw me under the bus and ignored all the evidence to the contrary and branded me guilty of being unprofessional for sexually assaulting this person (and no, she was not a patient) and revoked my licence to work as a nurse. 

This went on the news, and my life has been utterly destroyed. I'm in debt. No one wants to hire me. I cant do the job I love anymore.

I’m afraid for his future, what will wait him?

What I see now is other women nitpicking situations to blame it all on men.  

I recently had issues with workplace harassment from my boss, no not because I’m a woman, but because he’s a jerk on a power trip: Calling me up to 27 times in 1 hour knowing I was at the emergency room for having fallen down a flight of stairs.   Assigning me to projects that had already been taken care of  then blaming me, and even going as far as saying on a private message that me wearing a bikini on Facebook was unprofessional and not dignified of a worker from this prestigious multinational company.  Finding the most minuscule things and blowing up in public...

It’s not because I’m a woman, he’s an absolute cunt to everyone.  He wanted me to leave the company instead of firing me.  

But funny thing is, when I asked for help from all these associations for women , all they wanted to know was if my husband abused me, if my husband beat me....  otherwise they wouldn’t help.   

They asked me to file it as a sexual harassment from my manager and I refused, because it’s not sexual harassment, it’s just this idiot on a power trip bullying me so I quit the job. 

I could ruin this man’s life just by lying and the whole feminist movement would back me.

That’s absolutely disgusting.

So because I refused this, I was denied any legal help.  

I’m not trying to sue, I don’t want money... I just want my manager to back off, take some interpersonal skill courses... I want him to stop creating an impossible workplace environment for everyone.  I want my SJW company to actually be just and not back him up because it’s easier to not move him to another team.

If it’s not to demonize men, they don’t want any part of it.

Two members of that union, both white men, recently approached me for advice on a situation they'd encountered, because they knew I had been a committee member of some years experience. I immediately told them that I'd left, and why I'd left, and they explained to me that they knew all about it and that's why they'd approached me.

The situation is that we all work in the same industry where self-employed people are often interviewed for jobs of a few days' to a few months' duration. These men met when attending such an interview. Man 1 had been leaving while the other waited in the lobby, and as he passed, Man 1 said to Man 2 that he was wasting his time; the job was only open to women and that any men interviewed were invited only to avoid the appearance of a women-only hiring process. Man 2 went into the interview, asked whether any of this was true, and was told quite unashamedly by the interviewers that it was.

It had been their inclination to complain about this to the union, which would be a reasonable reaction to such a flagrant breach of employment law, not to mention wasting their time preparing for and attending the interview. However, they are both aware that the relevant union subcommittee is heavily influenced by hardline feminists, and  that the union has consistently tolerated flagrant breaches of the union's own rules as well as absolutely illegal behaviour.

As such these guys' concerns are unlikely to be meaningfully acted upon. Not only that, but they both independently raised the likelihood of deliberate attempts to smear their reputation in retaliation makes them cautious about even making the complaint.

161,3gpv60,2015-08-12,MensRights,My men's rights tee designs were labeled 'offensive' by TWO screen printing companies in less than 24 hrs,"First of all, this is a throwaway account for privacy reasons and I'm sorry if it's against the rules. I know my experience is nothing compared to the literal horror stories that have been posted here but I just felt I needed to get this whole thing off my chest.

So I started thinking about opening an anti-feminism online store some time ago. I hate all these feminist slogan T-shirts that are everywhere nowadays. I wasn't familiar with the screen printing process but I figured I'd use the service of companies which handle that for you. And so I went for it. Boy, I was in for a treat.

After I'd created the shirt designs, I started looking for a screen printing company. I didn't expect there to be so many options to choose from, so I spent some time researching. There were two or three companies that kind of dominated the industry but they charged more than the rest just because they had more bells and whistles. 

This put me off as I couldn't afford to pay for unnecessary stuff. My first choice was a smaller company that I hoped would offer more of a personalized service. So I created my account, uploaded my designs and continued the work on my online store. However, the next day I was notified my designs were apparently in violation of this site's rules and qualified as offensive. I re-read their policy and while I did not agree that my designs [(here's a few examples)](http://imgur.com/a/mRjzb#1) were in any way abusive or offensive, I decided to let it go and use another service. I figured any arguments at that point would be meaningless.

Now here's where the real fun starts. After going through the entire process again - filling out forms, uploading designs etc. - I received a termination email of sorts from the second company too! This time it wasn't even some pre-written template. It was sent to me directly by the owner of the service, basically telling me to go to hell because of my 'ridiculous' views.

[Screenshot.](http://imgur.com/a/mRjzb#0)

A proud 'fefminist'? She must've been so mad that she started mistyping words and stuff, lmao. Acting all outraged by the fact that people are selling men's rights apparel. Because that's reserved for poor oppressed feminists only, right? But who's the oppressed one really? Again, my designs were in no way abusive!

Her condescending tone admittedly pissed me off, though the fact that she came off as an illiterate moron kind of amused me at the same time. It was frustrating mostly because I had to start all over several times but I tried not to get worked up about it and now I'm close to finishing my project with another company.

Everything I thought about feminism was true. It isn't about gender equality at all.

For the record, I have not mentioned any company names because I realize how passionate this community is. I don't want to feel guilty in case any companies/websites receive some sort of backlash due to my comments. Sure, I think they might deserve it to a certain extent but I also don't wish to affect their source of income even if their handling of the situation was questionable.

EDIT: To the guys who think I should post the companies' names: I appreciate your opinion, but it's not happening for the following reasons:

1) I DID submit personal details to both services. Some people have already called me a coward but I've had personal dealings with raving feminists before and I do not wish to go through all the bullshit again. Especially online. I don't have the time and I don't need the drama. If you feel I'm letting you down, sorry.

2) Whatever I've shared here, they will simply deny, so what's the point? It's their word against mine, except that it's also their company.

3) The companies are small enough that I can almost guarantee you won't be unfortunate enough to stumble upon their services unless you were very, very specific. If you're looking to get an online tee business going, don't make the mistakes I made and just go to a major company.

As far as the shirts go: as I mentioned in the original post, I'd considered working with one of the big screen printing companies to finish my store but after reading through the comments and doing some additional research, I'm going with an on demand fulfillment service. It's more convenient and I hope it won't take too long because I'm going on vacation soon. But more importantly, the process is completely automated so I won't have to deal with any more morons online. It costs more but I probably won't make much money either way, so fuck it.

For example, if I were to have a kid my current employer offers up to 2 weeks of paternity leave.  Mothers are offered 11 weeks of time off with full pay. 

The measly 2 weeks is better than the job I had when I actually did become a father.  They had a similar generous maternity leave policy, but *zero* paternity leave.  I had to take all of my banked vacation time so I could stay home and take care of my newborn and my partner.  When I got back to the office I was told that my boss had to fight for my job because the CEO wanted to fire me over that. 

As a father I have changed every diaper while I was home, mixed formula and bottle fed, bathed and changed the baby, tended to my partner’s needs while she recovered from the pregnancy.  But apparently a father’s place is away at the office?  If leave is offered at all, it should be a general “Parental Leave”, not maternity or paternity.

166,15novc8,2023-08-10,MensRights,Lost job due to false claims. My story.,"This is LONG so if you want read it all go for it. If not, extremely short summary at the end. 

I'm a 35M and have worked for this company for 14 years was going into 15th (starred when I was 19).

So I recently lost my job 2 months ago. I though I had handled the situation that I found myself in correctly with a female at work. This situation occurred at a site that wasn't my home site but was the females home site. 

Come to find out 2 days ago after going through mediation in an attempt to get my job back; it was discovered that the reason I thought I got fired for was NOT the reason I got fired for. The female claimed that I made sexual comments, comments about her looks, and grab her. She claimed that the sexual comments and the grab happened at the same time and the comment about her looks was at a different time. What she failed to realize that the time these incidents occurred there were witnesses. 

Now this is where it gets really fucked up. The comments about her looks. I did not say but I was present at the moment. I told the investigative team the name of the person that made the comment but I was accused of protecting that person that made the comment and continually harassed and accused for making the comment. And called a horrible team lead becuase I didn't know what the intent was behind the comment or why the comment needed to be said. Yet remember I wasn't the one who said the comment. 

The grab & sexual comments that she said that I supposedly did was in an area where there's video cameras and also witnesses. 

The investigation team pressued me and continually accused me of doing the grab and comment. The investigation teamed threatened me w/ the ability to pull video footage & audio recordings. I told them to do it woth no hesitation because my home site has a camera ever 6 feet and nothing is missed and I knew 100% I didn't not do what this girl claimed. I even offered to walk the investigation team through everything step by step what had occurred in the work area around the piece of equipment the female claimed the incident took place at as the site I was being question at had the same piece of equipment and same set up, becuase they were having difficulty understanding what occured. I offered it 5 times and was denied every single time. 

For 3 hours I was called a liar & accused of doing what this female claimed. I gave a 4 pg statement (written of course), was suspended, then 2 week later was fired. 

Fast forward 2 months - going the the EDR (employee dispute resolution) process - I get to mediation (which was 2 days ago) because I was denied every step of the process and was left with 2 sets - mediation & arbitration. 

During the mediation I get sent back my own statement that I had written 2 months ago. I am told to read my statement during and as I'm reading my statement, I start getting asked questions. Every time I'm asked a question I respond to back that yhe answer is the next sentence, or the next line down, or the next 2 or 3 lines down. And as I continue reading my statement and I keep getting asked questions. I realized they never read my statement. They took the female's words over mine. When they brought up that they had multiple statements. All they talked about was the female's statement. The only time another statement was brought up was when the comment about her looks were mention but all the other statement said that they heard the comment but no name was given. 

Strike 1.

So then as I continue to read my statement. And I come up to the portion where I thought I did something wrong and corrected is why I was getting fired actually turned out to not be the reason while I was getting fired. This portion was where I was accused to have grabbed her by the hips and made the sexual comments. I asked during the mediation did their investigation team tell them that offered multiple times in the site that they were questioning me at to show them what happened around the piece of equipment the said accusations occurred around. The response was 'no'. Then I asked what is this girl's definition of a 'grabbed'.  They respond to back, they don't know what the girl's definition of a grab was. They just saw grabbed in her statement and assumed it was both hands. 

Strike 2 & 3.

When the camera footage a brought up and they told me the investigation team was going to pull video footage. I followup with what did the footage show they delfected to the comments about her looks and asked me what was the intent behind the comment about her looks and I responded back to them again. I was not the one that made the comment. I don't know the intent behind the comment and you need to talk to the person that I named in my statement & told your investigation team even though they accused me of lying and protecting that person what the intent was. They responded back to me that they did talk to that person and when I asked what was it, they back tracked and said we we have a statement that says it was said.

Strike 4 & 5.

Let's just say the tone went from 'we're never gonna give your job back' to 'we are very flexible'. 

So I decided to not take my job back and have them change my status from terminated to resign and I told them in a very polite &  professional way they can go fuck themselves.  Because in my the last 5 years with the company. I've had dealt with so lies told about me than any other time in the last 15 years total I have worked for them, and there was no guarantee that they would not do this again in the future.

So it was discovered that I was fired wrongfully based off of lies by the female & investigation team.


Short version: Got fired from job worked at for 15 years by claims made by female. Ended up finding out 2 months later female made false claims & investigation team also lied.",Tony2557,t2_8i0ebp19,0.96,152,24

170,168szk1,2023-09-03,MensRights,Unfair Suspension at work,"For legal reasons, I have changed any identifiable names, dates, locations etc. 

I work for a large police force in England as a civilian member of staff. In 2021, I started having an affair with a female colleague. The affair was supposed to be sexual and nothing more, but it grew. Two months into the affair I was promoted to a supervisory position. We will call the person I had an affair with Jess. 

Workplace relationships (including affairs) are very common amongst police forces in England. Working with loved ones on your shift is also not uncommon. Upon my promotion, I was due to be Jess' direct line manager. I declared the nature of our relationship and made adjustments to the team I was managing to ensure I was not her line manager. I was simply a supervisor who worked on the same shift. 

Approximately 5 months into our relationship (now very much into 2022), me and Jess got into an argument and I told her I was no longer interested in a relationship. This led to Jess attempting to throw herself in front of a moving lorry and me having to restrain her to prevent this from happening. The whole incident was recorded as me being a domestic abuse suspect, but no further action required. 

Despite my better judgements, I agreed with Jess to give our relationship another chance. This went well for 4 / 5 months where I found we were arguing a lot, so again I decided to end the relationship. She asked I went to see her in person, so I agreed. When getting to the address she was at, as I knocked on the door, she overdosed on cocaine and passed out in front of me. I had to ""scoop and run"" her up to the nearest A&E due to ambulance delays. I then remained with her for hours until she was discharged home. 

Again, ignoring the warning signs, I decided to agree to return to our relationship for another chance. 2/3 months later we amicably agree we would be better as best friends and proceed as such. 

At this stage, I was severely struggling with my mental health, having made suicide attempts, been a high risk missing person and was regularly inflicting self harm. My managers approach to this was ""just come to work to distract yourself"". I'm now in a place where I could honestly say, I should have been sectioned. 

During one of my breakdowns, Jess decides she no longer wants a friendship as it will lead to more between us. This just toppled me over the edge, and I took some time off work. During the argument, Jess made it clear she was very upset she had no pictures and no memories of our relationship. 

During a brief period off work, I shared a link with her that gave her access to a folder on my phone containing pictures of our memories. Some of these images were indecent images of her. When I shared the link with Jess I told her ""save what you want to keep, I know you said you were upset you didn't have any"" or a text similar to this. 

I feel it is important to note, the argument we got into as friends that led to us no longer being friends was her demanding that I requested I changed shift. She had provided me a deadline, and if I had not changed shift by then, she would ""get me off the shift another way"". 

Fast forward a few weeks, I decide to report the threat that was made. I didn't want to leave my shift. I reported the threat to a colleague of the same rank of me, and a Police Inspector. I was told I would speak to police officers to provide a statement. 

Some days pass (1 week), and no one speaks to me. However, I notice police officers start speaking to Jess regularly. So I challenge this with my line manager who is also a Police Inspector. My Inspector simply stated ""Females are statistically more vulnerable and more likely to be a victim, so we have to prioritise her.""

Unhappy with this, I demand to speak to his line manager, which is a Chief Inspector. To my surprise, the Chief Inspector also stated ""Females are more vulnerable, so we will prioritise her.""

A further couple of days pass, and I am arrested for malicious communications and Coercive and Controlling behaviour. The exact allegation is I threatened to use the indecent images of Jess by sending them to her boyfriend to expose our affair if she ended the relationship with me. 

I feel it is important to note, the criminal investigation which saw all my electronics seized etc. Found NO evidence of any offence in 1 month and a couple of days. 

Once the criminal investigation closed, the police force I work for launched an internal investigation for gross misconduct... yes... despite there being no evidence found. That investigstion is currently in its 7th month, and I still have not been asked to provide my own account. 

The head of the team investigating me is a ""white ribbon ambassador"" - which essentially means they lead by example to end ""Men's violence towards women"". 

Police forces across England at the moment are massively orientated towards penalising men who work for them at the slightest allegation due to media attention for other cases - like PC Wayne Cousins or PC Carrick. 

I feel my rights don't matter simply because I'm male and I'm being offered no help and support. If I raise a grievance, I'm told it won't be investigated until after my misconduct process. I've been instructed thst I cannot obtain my own evidence for my misconduct investigation.

Girls who are below typical attractiveness making solid incomes, not even just young women but often well into their 50's, and attractive but not unbelievably so women making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. At the same time, people are having less sex than ever. If you consider going over a year without sex on average to be incel status, about a third of adult men are incels. It's no longer some niche thing that you have to be unusually ugly or unlikable to be. This only drives up the value of even getting the faint illusion of connection to a woman further out of reach, worsens porn addiction. 8 years ago, Tinder would give me about a match every 2 days. Now I'd be lucky to get one a week, and half of what I do get are onlyfans girls advertising. I'm with someone now but the dating landscape is devastatingly bad. Fewer men having success in dating broadens the range of women who can make a living off of having no skills but just having tits and a vagina, and exploiting the desperation and loneliness of this ever growing pool of men, who are simultaneously discriminated against in the workplace and made to consider their own sexuality evil, pressuring them to express it in the most toxic and non self respecting forms, giving up money they've worked for for someone who views them as a utility, not a mutual exchange of like for like, as with a healthy hookup or relationship, not even like a traditional husband wife partnership where the husband is the breadwinner and the wife works hard to take care of home and family, but for resources for essentially nothing but their existence, and a few feeble gestures of fake affection. Sex work is not like normal work. It doesn't produce something we wouldn't otherwise have. It takes something people would normally do for love and fun, something which emotionally bonds and creates joyful shared experiences and encourages it to be removed from it's joyful context withheld for money, 99% one way. Does ANYONE think with less sex work, the world would be a worse place? With women being required to be actually productive to make money instead of lying around and feeding unhealthy addictions brought about by and encouraging the loss of intimacy between the sexes?

I know my opinion is unpopular even in this subreddit, because ""It's consentual selling of services like any other business transaction"" etc. but all I can think of when I see this more and more often is people selling something they did nothing to earn, with minimal required skill, and all the lonely, desperate men who feel locked out of basic joys of life that they're exploiting. Does nobody think maybe the reason it's a taboo and disrespected profession historically is because it's deeply toxic, antisocial and destructive, like, say, gambling? It really repulses me. My question is where are the breaks on this thing? What is to stop this expanding to the significant majority of women exploiting the majority of men, apart from a cultural attitude that it is to be looked down upon, and men refusing to let themselves be taken advantage of? But with men getting lonelier year on year, the desperation must grow stronger and stronger. You can't fix it with law, it will only make the behaviour more covert. There's too many grey areas. We've seen those women who hop from guy to guy, sleeping with him now and again and never paying rent or bills or working until the guy gets tired and she finds a new one, while the guy next door loses a shift at his job and has to sleep on the street. We already know women control the majority of spending, buy houses earlier etc. despite technically, in a reported sense, making less than men. It should be no wonder how.

Essentially the post is about how some dude in the office (27M) won’t speak to OP (24F) and the other women at the office. He won’t talk with them about anything other than work with the girls, but is friends with the guys. However, he is cordial and will exchange some basic pleasantries (have a good day etc). In other words, he is being a normal coworker and OP doesn’t like that.

Now here’s the twist. OP said that one of the girls is considering go to HR about this because she is saying its creating a hostile work environment. This is the part that really pissed me off. Now I acknowledge that maybe the majority of women aren't like this, don't generalize blah blah blah I get it. However, it's not that every woman will, but that any woman can. This is the exact same situation as the google manager in a thread that got posted a while back where the guy got fired for not responding to a female coworker's advances. So the idea that this is an impossible scenario is simply false.

There is simply no winning anymore. Now if you follow the Pence rule, you can be punished for that to.   Act friendly with a woman and ask her out or show interest, and you get punished or fired for harassment. Okay. Men adapt. Now, you act professional with a woman, and her and her friends get upset that this is a hostile work environment and want to report this to HR. If a man does A he gets in trouble. If he does B he gets in trouble. If he reverses course and does Z or Y he gets in trouble as well. If he says f the system it's all BS and goes MGTOW, then he gets labelled incel, misogynist, sexist.

It is promising however that pretty much everyone in the thread called OP out for her total BS, but the simple fact that a group of women would even think to do this is just insane. I suspect (this is just my opinion) that the man is attractive, she showed interest, he says no thanks let's talk about work, and she takes it personally and builds a *hostile work environment* in her mind because she can't fathom that someone doesn't want to be best buddies with her *at work* and just wants to be professional. More attention-seeking bullshit. Nobody is entitled to friendship to anyone, but somehow this is too much to comprehend for some people. Imagine being so fragile that someone not being your best friend makes you feel uncomfortable. It honestly seems to me that she and the other girls at the office are harassing him. Rules for thee but not for me. I shoot you for no reason, but I am the victim.

Imagine if a group of guys went to HR and said, ""we feel upset that a female coworker at the office won't talk with us"". They would be annihilated. This is just complete delusion.

I was marketing and communications manager for a nonprofit with a staff of 11. I did social media, desktop publishing, graphic design, web, light IT, anything to do with marketing. The new black female ceo came in and harassed me about everything she could take issue with like being ""intimidating"" because I'm tall. 


After three years of exemplary performance under the previous ceo they eventually fired me for leaving work 15 minutes early and called it ""job abandonment"" and denied me unemployment and hired a female to replace me. She lasted a few months since she couldn't do the job and they hired another woman I went to school with who was totally incompetent. 


I tried to get out before the fired me since I knew they were trying to pressure me out. I interviewed for a similar position at the nearby university but they hired one of my boss's middle age Hispanic female colleagues over me and the black female who interviewed me told my boss I interviewed for the spot. The Hispanic female they hired instead of hiring me called me a week later to ask me ""how to do what I do.""

When you analyze this fact, it's actually more than just extra work and less retirement- it actually results in death. We know that men are significantly more likely to work in dangerous jobs, and the workplace mortality rate is much higher for men- men are [10 times more likely](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckdevore/2018/12/19/fatal-employment-men-10-times-more-likely-than-women-to-be-killed-at-work/#3720c15a52e8) to die at work.

So asking men to work longer is asking them to take more of a risk of dying at work. This is especially true when you consider that after the age of 60, that risk would be increased.

Yet women’s constant economic/success expectations are just “preferences”.  

Work is what we are doing with our bodies.  Especially with the type of work men do (and whether it is paid OR unpaid, as men do a lot of dangerous and/or dirty jobs in their homes as well).  Women expecting their partners to pay for them, take care of them, or even protect them, is an issue of bodily autonomy.  

Especially in an equal society, with women making more money than ever before, the lack of ability to recognize this aspect of men’s bodily autonomy reeks of male disposability.  Despite that we’re not seeing gender expectations not changing for men by women, and I would argue it’s getting even worse as more and more men are being deemed economically invalid romantic partners with women making more AND wages stagnating.  I think many men could be in a much better place if socially and romantically they weren’t punished so harshly for these struggles and these aspects of their autonomy were recognized.   

I see too often in life where men are rejected because of their financial expectations, exacerbating the societal problems men have, and people writing it off as “incompatibility” via values.   And while I can agree that can happen, in an equal society it mostly just feels more like entitlement to what men’s labor.",StupidSexyQuestions,t2_frdmr7fe,0.88,20,8

He was working on  kitchen in a million plus home, and the wife insisted on being present all day as he and his employee worked. She commented non stop and many times had long conversation on her phone as the men worked. The kids would go about the house coming dangerously close to equipment and the mess that can hurt them. He couldn’t take it anymore. He said nicely please, can they leave him to finish the work and she can review after it was done. She had a melt down, and insisted on talking to his boss. Not satisfied that he was the owner she called the main line number. What she got was the contractors wife who listed patiently about how rude the man talked to her, repeating several times a conversation that lasted about a minute. The contractors wife insisted on speaking to her husband. She told him under no certain terms was he to stay in the house, and that if he didn’t leave the cunt to fix her own mess, she would drag him out of the home herself. She wasn’t having any of it. The contractor tried one last time to ask the lady to leave them to work, when she wouldn’t, they packed up, taking the supplies she hadn’t paid for yet and a job about a third done. 

He also reminds me that in construction one of the most dangerous jobs is roofing. It kills dozens of men annually.

They should be either paid more than females, or require the same physical standards.","Doesn't the slogan ""Equal pay for equal work"" apply here?

If everyone is to be paid the same, tests should be gender neutral. This would also account for genders other than male or female that people would like to be identified.

Physical fitness test should be cater to the job, not the gender. Military is a profession, not a welfare program.

This webpage, although a little outdated, gives a brief outline of the scoring standards for fitness tests of all US military services. ([https://mybaseguide.com/military-fitness-tests/](https://mybaseguide.com/military-fitness-tests/))

The one for the Army is a little outdated. The former test, APFT, was gender discriminatory. The new test, ACFT was initially supposed to be gender neutral. Then they changed it to where the scoring would be gender neutral, but females would get more promotion points for the same score. Then they changed one component of the test, from the leg tuck to the plank, and also made the scoring gender discriminatory. The most recent scoring for the test is ([https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/acft/ACFT\_scoring\_scales\_220323.pdf](https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/acft/ACFT_scoring_scales_220323.pdf)) .

I also hold the view that physical tests should also be AGE neutral. In the case of jobs or ranks that don't require high physical standards, make the physical tests less demanding ( a General doesn't need the same physical fitness as an infantryman/infantrywoman/infantryperson ).

FYI, the intelligence test for the US military is called the ASVAB, and is gender neutral.

For the argument that females bring skills other than physical fitness, if any such skill is important, it should be measured in a gender neutral way.

In case they need females for a specific task, a temporary limited exemption may be made (example: Cultural Support Teams that were useful in Muslim countries).  But a service wide exemption is unfair.

For the argument that females are generally less stronger that males and that should be accounted for: There is no reason to give special exceptions to any category. Why don't we categorize by height then? Why not by eye color, or hair color? What about gender makes it necessary to categorize by that? Also, combat is gender neutral.",jacare_o,t2_14fj8j,0.85,1960,307

&#x200B;

This LinkedIn study from 2019 used their internal data to examine differences between men and women when job searching. Among the key findings are the fact that men and women view a similar number of jobs though women apply to 20% fewer. A recruiter is 13% more likely to view a man's profile which she described as result of a problematic bias that must be corrected (even though they also found that recruiters will still contact both genders at equal rates).

However, the author (Maria Ignatova) makes no effort to hide her own bias (and sexism) by writing:

>The good news is that when women do apply to a job, they are 16% more likely than men to get hired. In fact, if the role is more senior than their current position, that number goes up to 18%.  
>  
>While this is an uplifting stat, it does show that women do a very thorough job at vetting roles — sometimes maybe too thorough. If women only apply when they feel extremely qualified, this could also indicate they are not pursuing stretch opportunities.

Linkedin is a mainstream website, not a fringe feminist blog. Yet blatant discrimination in hiring practices is celebrated as ""good news"" and as ""uplifting stat(s)"". This doesn't lead to equality, it's just another piece of evidence that equality isn't the actual goal.

Her analysis is also very weak and uses the usual strategy of reframing all issues so that women are the real victims. I think a more plausible hypothesis for why men apply to 20% more jobs is because if we are getting rejected more often then we need to submit more applications to increase our chances of finding work. Of course I would submit fewer if I was getting offers at 16-18% higher rate.

For most of us, this is just seeing statistics that support what we already knew is happening. The worst part is just being gaslit, and told this is ""equality"" and if we have a problem with it we are misogynist or examples of ""toxic masculinity"".

I live on the property of a private boat club, the property is gated, fenced, and has no trespassing signs all over. I live here to keep non-members out of the property as we are located on the water in a large park. 

Tonight I come home from work and do my walk around the property, as I do everyday, and I came across to young women sunbathing on one of the docks. I asked if they were members, they said no, and asked the to politely leave because this is private property. That's when they started to call me a perv, they can do what thay want, on and on. I am a very level headed person and let them rant and I calmly assed them to leave. They called 911 and screaming that some creepy old perv was harassing them. 

After a few minutes the police show up. Two female police. One goes and talks to the girls, the other talks to me. I explain to here that I live here and it is my job as caretaker to keep people from trespassing on the property. All the while the girls are getting all emotional with the other officer using words like creepy, they felt threatened, rape, the whole 9 yards. The 2 officers talk alone, then come over and cuff me risk me, take my wallet, phone, and keys, then seat me in the back of my car while they check my background and a warren search. All the while the two sunbathing girls are all giddy about me being in cuffs and taking my pic and text/posting like crazy. 

After about 15 minutes they take me out of the car and cuffs, and tell me I am free to go. (Go where? I fucking live here!) They then ask the girls, who are pissed that I was uncuffed, if they wanted to file a report against me, but they would have to leave the property. 

So for doing my job, on private property where I live, I end up in handcuffs for being considered ""creepy"" by doing my job. 

The officers never asked me if I wanted to file charges against them for trespassing.....of course.

I spoke to the board members of the club and we agree that in the future I should just call the non emergency number for the police and to record it. I also contacted a member who is a retired from the state supreme court and she told me ""that is utter bullshit"" as to how I was detained and she is putting a call into the police chief. I appreciate all the support, thank you!

I should hear something in a few weeks. I got the names of of the two girls who were tresspassing. So far I have not found any pics of me cuffed in the back of the car.

So this afternoon was low at work and I called the CPD internal affairs division to find out the status of my complaint against the officers.

I am a single male between the ages of 25 – 35. 
At any company I have ever worked for, over 80% of promotions are given to parents, married women, single women, and married men.
My current company is almost done with an expansion phase and has filled almost all of the lateral and higher positions with people in these categories.
My only hope is that I have seen married men and especially recently married men get a better chance at getting promoted.

I will be switching to a new company in a few months, due to the lack of upward mobility at my current job.  
If I do this, I will go through the entire process, starting with the interview, while wearing a wedding ring.

Thoughts?


**Edit 1:**
In response to the company functions comment, almost all of the men who recently got promoted never show up to any of the company functions.


**Edit 2:**
Some of the comments about the different groups do make sense and I acknowledge the holes in the way I presented my issue.

How about this?
If a married and single man both apply for the same job, which both look the same on paper and have the same performance record; then the married man will get the job in my current company.

Is this a valid statement? 


**Edit  3**
Please, consider this.

When I ask business mentors, friends, ex-bosses, business owners, and other people in my industry I am given the same basic fact:
“A man who is married or has a kid will get more promotions and get bigger bonuses than a single man.  The single man needs to be perfect at his job and work 120% harder than his married co-workers to get ahead.”

Is that not the same exact situation that women faced when they first started to entered the work force in large numbers?

is a very proud feminist. I am the only male in the class. This is a small college so she is teaching the entire program. The man bashing was getting out of hand and I had enough. So I wrote her this email regarding some of my issues in the class:

Hello R\*\*\*,

I am not happy in your classes. I feel that it is the duty of the instructor to present the material as unbiased as possible, and as a proud feminist you do not do that. These issues are not new, I have been feeling this way for a long time. However, it was on Wednesday of last week that I reached my breaking point. In my twenties I may have identified as a feminist, but I’ve grown since. I do not support the feminist ideology. I believe in equal rights, but “woke feminism” is a joke at best, and very dangerous at its worst. I realize that you are very passionate about your feminist beliefs, but I am not, and I do not want to hear it in the classroom any longer. I have requested several times to transfer to another class however B\*\*\*\*\*n is not responding to my emails. I can no longer sit quietly on this. Until they can find another class for me to join, I will be joining your lectures, but I will do minimal participation. I will not answer questions, and my camera will be off. Topics such as mansplaining, manspreading and the pay gap are non-issues. Mansplaining is a feminist tactic to silence men, manspreading is due to biology, the pay gap is due to the difference choices that men and women make. To pay someone differently for the same job with the same qualifications is illegal and every time they look for it in the West, they repeatedly find men as the underpaid gender, if it exists at all. Just look at what happened with women’s soccer in the US and the BBC in the UK. There is no Patriarchy, just a hierarchy based upon competence, with the most competent rising to the top. And that is just the tip of the iceberg.

Feminism is an ideology based upon victimhood and I will not be a part of that belief system.

It is because I like and respect you that I am writing this email. If it was not for that, I would not have returned.

One last point, men make up 95% of war casualties. The ones that do survive are traumatized, disfigured and never the same. To say that women and children are the biggest victims of war, was deeply offensive. If one considers all people as equals and you can still regard women and children as the biggest victims of war, something is very wrong with your reasoning. Most of those men that died; died protecting our borders so we can be safe and enjoy our lives in peace. Do not discredit their sacrifices. None of them wanted to die, but that was the cost of our freedom.

Sincerely,

88888 8888888

Update:

My professor's reply was sent through Bongo. Our classes are all online. I didn't realize that Bongo does not automatically save private messages. The gist of her reply was that she apologized for making me feel uncomfortable in class and she wants to talk with me face to face about my issues with the class. I actually have a good relationship with the professor. I do have the support of all the students in the classroom. The day of the incident where she was particularly man bashing I commented that there was ""too much man hating going on"". The rest of the class either apologized or came to my defense. I really like my classmates. I then went completely silent for the rest of the week and did not join her class. 

In class I've been referred to as ""one of the good ones"" which I find particularly patronizing. I actually do like my professor and we do have some good debates. I am the only one to challenge her opinions in class and she respects that.
I'm not worried about her retaliating, there have been so many complaints about her and she is constantly flirting with myself and others. Everything is recorded. There is enough evidence that I could get her fired for sexual harassment. Everyone in the class is aware of how she is. Out of an original 9 students 5 remain with one who walked out yesterday and says that she won't come back. As horrible as my email was to her, I'm not worried.

I will talk with her and record the conversation. I will post another update once we talk.",dukunt,t2_p72jy,0.92,891,112

But It turned out she was Doing things behind my back, making out I was ""Stalking and harrasing her"" to my fellow collegues..

She  started a hate campaign against me but at the same time going out of  her way to start conversations with me only when we were alone, I  started gaining more and more disrespect from the collegues she was  close too, with the perception that she was still my friend..

A work collegue had told me everything she had been saying about me behind my back.

I  completly withdrew I no longer went to lunch at the same time as her,  which was the same time the collegues I was closest too went to lunch, I  became completly isolated

At this  point I had had enough of her, I was showing clear signs of  disinterest, but she still continued to try to have one on ones with me.

In  the end I had to quit my job, I felt Like a sitting duck, There was no  way I could win because everything is designed to protect her.

I decided to walk away with my dignity.

When  I quit my job I went back for 1 last day and her behaviour once she  knew I was quitting, it became clear she hated my guts, she was rude at  every opputunity possible during my last day..

212,tcyo1p,2022-03-13,MensRights,"Australian report by feminist organisation claims support for men's rights is a ""significant barrier to gender equality""","This report summarises a survey of Australians with regards to attitudes towards gender equality and was conducted by a feminist organisation which is, as they all are, solely focused on things like getting more female CEOs and more women elected to political office.

There is some good news in the report and the feminists must have burned in anger at having to write it. For example:

>**Men have been forgotten in the struggle for gender equality**  
>  
>Our survey reveals a worrying statistic in this regard: nearly half of all male respondents “agreed or strongly agreed” with the statement that “gender equality strategies in the workplace do not take men into account”. If we disaggregate the data by generation, we find that while millennial and builder males were most likely to report feelings of being left out, all generations exhibited similar sentiments. Millennial males were also significantly more likely (48 per cent) to “agree/strongly agree” with the statement that “Men and boys are increasingly excluded from measures to improve gender equality”, followed by Gen Z males at 44 per cent. Gender equality measures are not the only interventions that are perceived by men to deepen, rather than fix existing inequalities. The highly contested concept of freedom of speech also reveals significant gendered differences, with men far more likely to say that political correctness benefits women in the workplace.

This section is surprisingly revealing of feminist motivations. I'm surprised they would include this in a public report:

>**Male moderates are champions of men’s rights**  
>  
>The moderate perspective combines an egalitarian set of views around gender equality in the workplace and at home with rising concern over what they understand as the growing impact of political correctness in Australian society, as well as a strong desire to see men’s rights equally represented in public discussion of equality issues. Given that 62 per cent of Australians align with the moderate position and its value system, this represents a significant barrier to gender equality.

Got that?

Feminists think that concerns for men's rights and a desire to see men treated equally to women are an obstacle to feminists achieving the goals that they dishonestly label ""equality"".

Other stats cited include:

* 41% of Australian men believe that political correctness gives women an advantage in the workplace
* 46% of Australian men believe that gender equality measures do not take men into account
* 42% of Australian men believe that men and boys are increasingly excluded from measures to improve gender equality

The feminist authors fear that these popular and growing attitudes could result in a ""backlash"" against feminist initiatives and ""backsliding"" away from the goals which they're pursuing.

Of course, any time that feminists are unhappy or even hysterical it is good news for men and for progress towards true equality. I see this report as quite positive.

I knew it was bad but scrolling that newsfeed is simply skin crawling.

For the last couple of years I've just reflexively accepted connections without actually browsing it so I've got people from high school, university, my current employer, recruiters etc.

It's everything /r/stupidpol critiques consolidated in one place but to such a degree it's hard to believe it even exists. It's just non-stop cringe after cringe, not least when it's people you actually know.

But one thing I've been wondering is why the fuck do people play into it? Pronouns in bio, racial-pride flags, turbo-woke posting, fellating employers about how proud you are to work there, writing self-obsessive stories about how much you've learnt about ""leadership"" and ""collaboration"" today...

Does this ghoulish behaviour actually advance people in their career? I can understand the flattery and congratulations-posting, even writing little stories about workplace achievements if you're so inclined. That and connecting with everyone you bump into - traditional ""business shit"" to make yourself visible and relevant. But the woke posting and ""social justice"" activism just seems like it'd be a career-killer to me. It actually triggers a disgust response in me psychologically speaking and I cannot forget it as being associated with that person.

I am relatively young and have not been in the position to make hiring decisions but my God if I saw this type of shit from an applicant it'd be an immediate ""no"". That person is straight trouble, they'll be mentally unstable, bring political divisiveness into the workplace, not do their damn job, harm my prospects and that of the team.

So why do people do this and does it actually have the negative impact I think it should? Shitlib-posting against your real name seems like a giant fucking liability but people still do it. Is it just for charlatans? I rarely see it from people I think of as competent, skilled or worth being around. Invariably they have pretty neutral, professional profiles.

I noted with interest that some Silicon Valley companies were starting to be hardline about not bringing activism or politics into the workplace [e.g. Coinbase in 2020](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804) and what happens there typically seeps out into the wider industry in the next 5 years.

219,1ajruaf,2024-02-05,stupidpol,My Experience With Modern White Collar Work And Its Anti-Human Culture,"Hello Stupidpol, this is a topic that may not tie directly into identity politics but I believe my experience working in modern day corporate culture will be of interest to you as it is my opinion so many of the ills of our society and economy culminate into this one core part of our modern civilization.

Just to state at the outset. I have left this work behind a year ago but it has been on my mind as of late. The long winter is over for me and I couldn’t feel better about it. The job itself was not bad in the sense that I enjoyed decent pay and benefits but the work itself was a miserable waste of pseudo intellectual bullshit. I followed the path set out in the liberal educational order of the 90s and 2000s. Go to university, get a degree, and graduate into an office job of some sort. I actually caught that car in the rat race, and while I do not regret it per se (I mean I do, I could have been doing so much other cool or useful shit besides this), I learned quickly many truths of our system and it’s quiet injustices.

**1.) 80% of corporate work is just grifting**

This was my experience anyways and what I saw in the many different massive companies I worked with. I got views into numerous different industries especially related to insurance, and I would say 80% of the people in these companies are mostly innocent grifters. Honestly I have nothing against these people either. We live in a society that requires you have a job to pay the mortgage and everyone is just surviving who isn’t at the top or shareholders. I was also a grifter. All the work I saw others do or did myself generally revolved around what Socialist writer Mark Fisher described as…

*“…This reversal of priorities is one of the hallmarks of a system which can be characterized without hyperbole as ‘market Stalinism’. What late capitalism repeats from Stalinism is just this valuing of symbols of achievement over actual achievement…”*

After years of working as an 'analyst' I do not think I saw a single useful thing happen from any of the work we did for clients. This is because many of the “problems” we were tasked with finding/solving were features of the system not bugs, especially with insurance companies. Our actual unspoken job was keeping middle management employed by giving them something pretty they could show their superiors after performing lots of “analysis”. It was a circle of doing absurd amounts of that pseudo intellectual work mentioned before, only for it to be consumed pointlessly.  Rinse and repeat.

This is what many people don’t get about modern capitalism. Is it efficient on paper? Sometimes sure, often times even, but there’s a dark truth in the new era of the “intellectual labor class” that defines the digital era. Most of those college grads involved in anything that isn’t strictly STEM are probably just doing bullshit all day soaking up enormous amounts of resources in society, just as middle management is doing too. This is also the group where most of the woke types work or aspire to work. Go figure. 

**2.) The pseudo intellectual labor class gives me a very bleak outlook on where liberalism has pushed mankind**

Time to get Kaczynski-pilled 

Large swaths of our population are being turned into one-dimensional people. By this I mean their entire identity and personality basically becomes the embodiment of anti-truth and anti-human living. 

In short the entire modern corporate culture is one of extreme neuroticism.

Those that work in the modern corporate world are forced into the shape of a one dimensional being that must present a perfect world at all times. Any violation of face is taken as an existential threat. This is why it is anti human. A pale reflection of humanity that they are enslaved sometimes without even realizing it. Those that do realize it suffer mentally because of it (mental health issues are common in this crowd). They are so completely and totally captured by the perceptions of others that their own identity becomes void. They are three dimensional beings that must force themselves into a one dimensional state. The perfect picture, flawless in its depiction. As a result everyone is terrified of each other and all genuine human interaction is stifled.

That is the nature of the one dimensional corporate man. Humans are complex, dirty, messy creatures. They are people, and people make mistakes. But not the one dimensional man, for he is perfect. 

If you asked me to define the culture of the modern white collar corporation I would say it is most shaped by the collective fear of one’s mask slipping. This completely destroys unique and authentic expression. This type of conformism creates a really fertile ground for identity politics grifting.

This of course does not stop in the corporate environment. You can see it in our entire culture as social media has pushed us in a direction of sterilization. Our modern economy and culture is producing increasing numbers of linked-in posters and atomized, lobotomized, conforming, consumers. The corporate environment is an incubation chamber for this cultural attitude. 

You are promoted based on this quality. How tight do you wear your mask? 

God is dead and these people are the archons of a spiritually bankrupt society, doing pointless, sometimes sisyphean levels of work for money.

**3.) The people who rule you are linked-in posters**

As mentioned in the previous point it is a certain type of conformist mask wearing type that is promoted to the highest echelons of the corporate world. Hard work or true achievement means very little, it is only presentation. 

The reason the economic system is so cruel, and seemingly insulated from change is not just money in politics or capital incentives, but also because of the type of people that make it to the very top. 

Imagine how one must twist themselves to thrive in such an insane anti-human environment as this? Humans need not apply, seriously. The more you are willing to bend your will to the mentality, and especially if you take a “positive” attitude toward the insanity the higher you will go.

I could go on but this is getting long enough. Hopefully you found this interesting from someone once at the heart of the machine. This is of course just my experience and could be different for you or someone else. It is also just my opinion and I do not claim to be an expert in really anything. I will also say that pretty much everyone suffers in this environment. The corporate culture of America is extremely degrading to the human spirit and I am not at all surprised at the rise in mental health issues in our society after knowing what huge swaths of people spend their time doing every day.  I weep for my coworkers, especially the ones who have forced themselves to conform to succeed.

Here's the text, since it's not yet in the internet archive:

>Labor strikes last year marked a record for the 21st century. Thanks to this [strike wave](https://newleftreview.org/sidecar/posts/strike-wave),  workers in industries from auto manufacturing to transportation to film  and television won better contracts. We also witnessed organizing among  workers whom few in decades past would have considered candidates for  unionization, such as college athletes, congressional aids, and  presidential-campaign staffers. This is for the good, and it could  portend a renewal of the shared prosperity that was lost to the  neoliberal revolution starting in the 1970s.  
>  
>“The problems with porn work are inherent in the nature of the industry.”  
>  
>But  one category of fresh organizing that shouldn’t rally the labor  movement at large is obvious: namely, the pornography industry.  Unionization is not the answer to what ails porn stars, because the  problems with porn work are inherent in the nature of the industry.  
>  
>Founded  in 2021, the Adult Performance Artists Guild calls itself the first  “federally recognized” adult-performers’ union in the United States.  Federal recognition is a bit of a red herring, referring to the group’s  registration with the Department of Labor’s Office of Labor Management  Standards. Registration with the federal government, in this sense,  doesn’t mean recognition by porn companies as an exclusive bargaining  representative for performers. APAG is an advocacy organization, a union  operating outside of any collective-bargaining relationship. While such  unions are indeed capable of achieving substantial goals, they lack a  critical piece that gives organized labor teeth: legal recognition to  act for a defined group of employees.  
>  
>Porn stars have plenty to  complain about. Performers are compensated by the scene and don’t  receive residual payments like actors represented by the Screen Actors  Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. They are  under constant threat of exposure to sexually transmitted diseases.  
>  
>Before  APAG came around, adult entertainers undertook a number of union  formation attempts to address these complaints. Early ones actually  succeeded. Later ones failed. In a sense, their fate mirrors the  trajectory of private-economy organizing in the United States in the  second half of the 20th century. In 1964, employees at Hugh Hefner’s  Detroit Playboy Club won union recognition as part of the Hotel and  Restaurant Employees (HERE) Union, a predecessor of today’s UNITE-HERE,  which represents hotel and airport workers. Detroit was a real union  town back then, and resistance by Playboy would have meant a level of  stigma that is all but unimaginable today. The Playboy Bunnies won what  was essentially the first sex-worker contract in the country. By the end  of the 1960s, all Playboy clubs were union shops. But by 1990, they all  went out of business.  
>  
>The advent of internet porn threw a wrench  in attempts at unionizing the porn and sex-work industries. As the  author Melinda Chateauvert noted in *Sex Workers Unite* (2014),  the digital age transformed how most Americans watch porn: Most porn  consumers stopped going to clubs or video booths and turned, instead, to  screens in the privacy of their own homes.  
>  
>Along with this shift,  porn became a corporate giant in the aughts. The big bucks no longer  went to producers, but to distributors. The pejorative term “Big Porn”  hasn’t entered our lexicon alongside Big Pharma and Big Tech, but it  should. The most heavily trafficked video-sharing sites are all operated  by a single corporate conglomerate called Aylo, formerly MindGeek.  Meanwhile, pornographic performers are more geographically dispersed,  making it harder to organize.  
>  
>Even when porn production was more  centralized, however, SAG and other mainstream unions refused to involve  themselves with porn-star organizing, not wanting to associate  themselves with a seedy sector of the economy. Ethnographer Heather  Berg, author of the 2021 study *Porn Work*, identifies an early  porn-star union-organizing attempt in mid-1980s San Francisco. Led by a  male performer outside the auspices of an established union, the  campaign centered on a demand for agreement among performers that nobody  consent to work for under $300 per scene. But too few observed the  pact, and producers blacklisted the leader.  
>  
>Similar organizing  efforts in the 1990s—addressing the threat of disease as much as low  pay—also collapsed. In 2004, an HIV outbreak triggered another  organizing effort, but it didn’t draw a consistent crowd of activists. A  few years later, the Adult Performers Association formed. It emphasized  health and advocated for performers but did so as a lobby, rather than  through bargaining and representation; it dissolved in 2012. The Adult  Performer Advocacy Committee picked up the gauntlet in 2014 as a  coalition of porn performers, directors, and producers. It had a similar  model to the Adult Performers Association, focusing on advocacy, rather  than worker representation under any kind of collective-action regime.  (Indeed, some performers were suspicious of its ties to the Free Speech  Coalition, the trade association for American pornographers.)  
>  
>This  isn’t an exhaustive list of all the attempts at organizing porn  performers. APAG, the most recent iteration, was founded precisely  because some performers saw APAC as an industry front group, rather than  an authentic vehicle for worker power. Whether APAG goes the way of all  its predecessors remains to be seen. What is sure is that there are  massive hurdles to a porn workers’ union achieving what most unions seek  for their members.  
>  
>For starters, the National Labor Relations Act  grants most private-economy employees the right to form and join  unions. It doesn’t, however, grant those same rights to supervisors or  independent contractors, and porn stars work as independent contractors,  paid by the scene. A different model of collective bargaining would be  required in this field. An even more fundamental problem is that the  lines between labor and management are very much blurred in porn  production. It is common for performers to be both “talent,” in the  lingo of the industry, and also to direct or produce, meaning they shift  between labor and management roles. And there isn’t much class  solidarity among performers. Berg observes that most porn stars “would  rather be a boss than have one \[who is\] disciplined by collective  bargaining.”

 

>As a public-sector unionist in a country where collective bargaining  in the public sector is frowned upon even by some who support  private-sector unions, I hesitate to say that a certain class of workers  have no business unionizing. But we first ought to consider whether  porn qualifies as a legitimate sector of work. Literature on this topic,  whether academic or journalistic, is exclusively from a progressive  perspective that decries neoliberalism. But this shows a lack of  self-awareness. The literature exhibits neoliberalism’s prime feature:  promoting the abandonment of customary norms and imposing a market  framework on a realm of life that most societies across most of human  history have sought to immure from the profit motive. Among the porn  activists and their academic and media allies, sex is described as just  another industry, and just another kind of work. Berg, for instance,  argues that sex work “is exploitative because it is labor under  capitalism,” not because it is a particular affront to the dignity of  the human person.  
>  
>Treating pornography performance as just another kind of employment leads to absurdities. For example, Chateauvert tells us in *Sex Workers Unite*  that sex discrimination in “the sex sector” is a major labor-management  problem. She points out the obvious fact that seniority is a liability,  rather than an asset. Claire Mellish in *Regulating the Porn Industry*  similarly notes that porn is “the only industry where racial and gender  discrimination form the basis of hiring decisions.” Porn observes a  so-called interracial rate—a premium paid to white female performers for  scenes with black male performers. Mellish observes that this practice  “directly violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which  prohibits an employer from making hiring decisions on the basis of race  or pay \[*sic*\] employees of different races differently.” Mellish  asks what exactly workplace sexual harassment, as defined by the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission, amounts to in the porn industry. What  are unwelcome sexual advances or a hostile and offensive work  environment in the context of taping a sex scene?  
>  
>The problem with  these observations in the academic literature on porn-star organizing  is not that they are false. Rather, their obvious truth exposes the  absurdity of evaluating pornography in the same manner as we do  practically every other sector of labor and employment. This line of  thinking leads to even more ridiculous questions. For example, why on  earth should a consumer of pornography care whether a film’s performers  are male or female, young or old? Wouldn’t that be condoning sexism and  ageism?  
>  
>The pathologies associated with porn are legion and widely  recognized, and they afflict both consumers and performers. They  include young women’s bad sexual experiences as men try to re-enact  scenes they have watched; and the fact that many performers recount  lives disfigured by childhood abuse, alcoholism, drug use, depression,  and disease. The notion that the only thing wrong here is economic  exploitation and poor working conditions isn’t compelling.  
>  
>Given  all this, the solution to the porn crisis isn’t so much organizing as  interdiction. These days, to the extent the public is concerned about  porn at all, it often has to do with children’s exposure to smut. The  public should be concerned, and this is a serious problem. But we risk a  dangerous inference from this concern: So long as everybody is at least  18, all’s well.  
>  
>“To object to a law because it is morally authoritative … is to misunderstand what law is.”  
>  
>Libertarians  and “sex-positive” left-liberals will shudder at the notion of public  authorities enforcing morals. But many laws regulate behavior, and ban  certain kinds of behavior, on moral grounds. To object to a law because  it is morally authoritative or seeks to shape behavior is to  misunderstand what law is.

>What about public opinion? A [2019 survey](https://ifstudies.org/blog/what-do-americans-think-about-banning-porn)  found that about a third of Americans favor banning porn. As with many  questions of public policy, many people probably don’t have well-formed  views and could be persuaded. Serious debate about banning TikTok could  mean the time is ripe for revisiting the easy availability of other  damaging online content, as well.  
>  
>Even some who don’t favor an  outright ban recognize the need to counter the very real dangers  pornography poses. A more feasible initial approach may be to arrest  pornography’s legal growth, and sequester it to analog media only—ban  digitally transmitted pornography, in other words. This approach is a  “nudge,” akin to hiding cigarette packs under the counter and covering  them with gruesome medical photos. It doesn’t outright interdict a  product, but it makes it more difficult to consume.  
>  
>Smartphones  bosting seemingly infinite access to content make for a kind of  compulsive porn use that has no equivalent in the analog world. This  produces a [similar neurological reaction](https://www.safcam.org/how-porn-affects-the-brain-like-a-drug#:~:text=It%20may%20be%20surprising%2C%20but,brain%20release%20the%20same%20chemicals)  to porn as drug addicts have at the thought of taking drugs. I’m barely  middle aged, but I remember a time when finding a large selection of  pornography meant slinking out to a dismal, lozenge-shaped hut near the  airport. The dreariness of the endeavor had the advantage of properly  orienting one’s mind to the depravity of the undertaking.  
>  
>Adding  artificial intelligence to the mix only strengthens the case for banning  online porn. In the fall of 2023, there was a deepfake outbreak at a  high school in New Jersey. Male students created fake images made to  look like naked female classmates. Recognizing the problem of  pornographic deepfakes, several states, including some of the most  progressive in the country, have made distributing fake porn illegal.  They are on the right track and should go a step further—to make all  digital porn illegal.  
>  
>Even if enforcement actions were taken  against pornographers, it wouldn’t and couldn’t eradicate digital porn.  Virtual private networks are sure to facilitate a digital fantasy for  those who want to take the extra step. Eradication can’t be the standard  by which an enforcement endeavor is measured. Rather, we must hold to  the simple principle that when a behavior is legal and permitted, there  will be more of it. Anyone who has walked the streets of a major  American city in the past three years knows this is true when it comes  to cannabis. If bans and enforcement against internet porn reduce  creation, distribution, and consumption, they would be doing some good.  
>  
>As  for organizing the porn industry, the labor movement today is more  popular with Americans across the political spectrum than it has been in  half a century. Against this backdrop, unions would do well to avoid  campaigns that are likely to appeal to the libertine left—and nobody  else. SAG was right to stay out of organizing porn in the 1970s, and it  is noteworthy that the union’s leadership has never changed its mind. A  strength of the labor movement is its mass appeal, serving as one of our  last remaining institutions that could anchor a [new center](https://compactmag.com/article/woke-is-dying-long-live-the-new-center). Organizing porn stars would waste labor’s broad appeal on a socially destructive cause.

What can I/we do?","I've been trying to switch careers from miserable manual labor into something that will pay a decent wage and allow for the basics, like an empty studio to sleep on the ground in.  I have been working really hard and using about every goodwill I have earned to keep a roof over my head while trying to juggle every pathway a mentally r*tarded man can do (IT, """"""learn to code"""""", trades, military officer etc.).  

I at first was completely blase about the election, same shit, but gender neutral amirite?  Until I read this;

https://buildbackbetter.com/priorities/racial-equity/

In it, it is made apparent that every single group except the retarded arbitrary one that I belong to will be focused on and uplifted, and they are the priority for healthcare, equitable wages, housing, etc.  I think those are all fantastic things to try and uplift for.  SO WHY AM I NOT INCLUDED IN THAT? Legitimately it's like tear jerking to read fantastic policies that could uplift the material conditions of people... be specifically, explicitly and exclusively not welcome to you specifically due to nebulous concepts such as white privilege.  

What does this mean in a practical world where you happen to be a wh*toid simply trying to get by in just about any professional industry or lifepath? Do people think woke performance will increase in the workplace due to this focus, as we all do the Wal-Mart dance around the new black guy who really just wanted a job and not to be paraded around in a creepy display?

I'm at a loss here -_-

As an addendum;  Between bootstraps capitalism, neoliberal prosperity doctrine and woke calvinism, being unsuccessful hurts on a much deeper level.  I feel like I have failed fundamentally as a human being as according to woke calvinism, i was predestined to be successful, rich and have a massive wang and the fact that i don't is a deep moral failing.

Krugman’s bullshit aside (this is the same man who once said “Immigration reduces the wages of domestic workers who compete with immigrants. That's just supply and demand.”), I’m more distressed at how thoroughly his liberal supporters have completely co-opted the old GOP rhetoric that “we MUST have mass immigration because business can’t find enough American workers”. There’s probably 50-60 examples in the linked Twitter thread alone that wouldn’t have been out of place in the comment section of Drudge 20 years ago.

He’s not even couching this in idpol or empathetic rhetoric about asylum anymore, this shit is bare metal Chart.png economic policy directly lifted from some 2008 era Koch Industries funded think tank. “It’s fine that American workers never regained employment after Covid, we made up for it with mass immigration”

Even if we steelman and accept that most of the Covid labor force decline is due to Boomers retiring/expiring, the fact that we (apparently) don’t have a large enough young population to fill those positions is indirectly partially a result of mass migration itself. Low wages and housing pressures are forever at the top of the survey list when people get asked why they’re single or not having kids.

I understand why Krugman himself is pushing this position - he’s paid to do it - but I’m kinda amazed at the mainstream Twitter lib opinion going from “big business uses immigration to hurt American workers” to “Trump is against immigration therefore we’re for it because we’re Good People” and finally now going full John Boehner “we want unlimited immigrants to fill 100% of new jobs because number goes up” in basically 5-6 years.

There are fucking right wingers in that thread responding with “doctors per capita” nation stats to liberals unironically arguing it’s Great that we’re robbing the third world of all their educated healthcare workers.

225,m63aha,2021-03-16,stupidpol,Why is Submissive Culture a Thing in Many Workplaces?,"In the last two jobs I've had so far, there is a strong culture of submission, as in for example, at my last job, most of the full timers did not take breaks other than lunch, even if our manager would sometimes say to do it, in part due to the pressure to keep up and finish, we'd rather skip breaks than be more rushed with them. At my current job, it is very common to not take our second break and also common to stay half an hour later to finish the work, because corporate demands a certain amount of work done, when it could easily be left to the morning. The problem is almost all the workers just go along with it, everyone is tired and wants to go home, but they give absolutely no resistance to pressure to work extra and when the issue is brought up, they just say they agree, or ignore the point, but never change. They just see it as how things are and aren't willing to even think about how it should or could be different. And managers also just see it as their job, they don't question either even when they're low level team leads. And because it's a thing everyone does, it's easy to fall in line oneself as a bad habit, at least for me sometimes. 

Companies don't even have to do much given this culture among workers, they don't have to threaten, harass, etc when workers both do everything they're told with no resistance and even do things that hurt themselves and benefit the company without being told. This experience has been in both food service and retail/fulfillment, I don't know how other jobs are but I assume it's a widespread and common thing. 

How do you get workers to even think about unionizing when they don't just not put up a fight on little things, but many times place more burdens on themselves?

And also why is this a thing? Why are people generally so submissive, specifically to employers, though it can also be applied to the state of the world in general?",JCMoreno05,t2_14xsjg,0.95,116,120

228,110i701,2023-02-12,stupidpol,Why the internet's learn-to-code obsession is baseless,"I understand this is a bit niche, but if you spend enough time around the internet, particularly reddit, you'll find loads of people claiming to work in the information technology/software/computers space, either as developers or ancillary occupations. If you fall into the right mainstream circles, such as career advice forums, they're completely inundated with an obsession for information technology, finance, blue collar trades, and a smattering of other careers. Anecdotally, it seems the job market in western society is becoming increasingly concentrated.

This career advice pushing youth towards tech is frequently accompanied by unsubstantiated claims of a ""shortage"" of human capital within the tech sector (despite admitting that there is also a large amount of job rationing, which is obvious cognitive dissonance). They cite examples of many mega-cap companies being borne from the tech sector, and that digitization is increasing, therefore developers will always be well-paid and in demand, i.e. it's a good career choice. 

Before I continue, please let me make three things clear:

1. General purpose computing/technology is incredibly powerful, and yes, there are large macroeconomic forces driving its continued adoption in all sorts of industries,

2. I do believe that information technology has brought many benefits to humanities and, for all its ills, has also alleviated a degree of human suffering, and

3. If you need to learn a trade, learning to make software is a decent choice. It is also accessible and personally rewarding.

That said, I recently listened to [this podcast episode,](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3NTusQGtqIE1Sop2EoJd9F?si=0cca9c5ffe564e4f) (Revolutions 10.3 - The Three Pillars of Marxism) in which Mike Duncan (the host) discusses, among other things, the division of labor, and how it serves to alienate workers from the products of labor, and recognize their value as human capital.

Oddly, the first chapter of [The Wealth of Nations](https://youtu.be/7pFD7xcKb1U) by Adam Smith also talks extensively about the benefits of the division of labor, by allowing for workers specification and comparative advantage. Everyone agrees that the division of labor can increase productivity and pushes down labor costs.

Anyways, to tie this all together:

Reddit's learn-to-code fetishism is already outdated, if it ever applied at all. I've worked in the tech industry for some time now and the division of labor has reached a point where most software developers, in addition to being at the base of the power structure of these companies, the bitch boys that do most of the work while a handful of MBAs make all the money, are effectively alienated from the products they produce. While it can be done (example: PUBG), it is increasingly difficult for small or one man dev teams to consistently compete with major industry players. **The software industry, while still relatively well-paid for the time being, is set on a course to become the factory floor of the 21st century.** More concerningly, software is setting trends for a highly fractured, insecure employment market moving forward. **White collar workers, who were previously able to rideout economic meltdowns in developed economies, like the US in the 1980s, will find themselves pushed into the labor class from the PMC class.** Pumping the brakes on the learn-to-code train, or at least creating class consciousness in this PMC->prole class, would be extremely beneficial to developed economies.

Therefore, journalists, who claim to be men of letters, philosophers, artists, also regard themselves as the ""true"" intellectuals. In the modern world, technical education, closely bound to industrial labour, even at the most primitive and unqualified level, must form the basis of the new type of intellectual. . . . The mode of being of the new intellectual can no longer consist of eloquence, which is an exterior and momentary mover of feelings and passions, but in active participation in practical life, as constructor [and] organizer, as ""permanent persuader"", not just simple orator.

&#x200B;

Here we go again, 

\> Millions of jobs that have been shortchanged or wiped out entirely by the coronavirus pandemic are unlikely to come back, economists warn, setting up a massive need for career changes and retraining in the United States. 

&#x200B;

\> “We think that there is a very real scenario in which a lot of the large-employment, low-wage jobs in retail and in food service just go away in the coming years,” said Susan Lund, head of the McKinsey Global Institute. “It means that we’re going to need a lot more short-term training and credentialing programs.” 

&#x200B;

\> Indeed, the number of workers in need of retraining could be in the millions, according to McKinsey and David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who co-wrote a report warning that automation is accelerating in the pandemic. He predicts far fewer jobs in retail, restaurants, car dealerships and meatpacking facilities. 

&#x200B;

\> Chewy, an online pet food and supply company, opened its first fully automated fulfillment center in Archbald, Pennsylvania, in October. Wall Street analysts who monitor the company closely say the facility — a warehouse where orders are processed and packaged for delivery — needs only about 10% of the workers who are at Chewy’s other warehouses.

“When you can take labor out and replace it with automation, you are taking out a significant cost,” said Stephanie Wissink, a managing director at Jefferies who researches Chewy. “You won’t eliminate all labor. Chewy will still have engineers and warehouse directors, but there won’t be nearly as many individual laborers walking those floors.

\> As online retail has boomed during the pandemic, warehouses have added nearly 115,000 jobs in the past year, meaning more workers are in the field now than there were pre-pandemic. Yet even that field is not a sure bet. Automation has become cheap enough that it is now being deployed more readily in warehouses and on factory floors, as Chewy illustrates. 

for those too young to remember, this is the same conversation from 2008. The automation claims may or may not be true, but at the end of the day it's important to realize this ""retraining"" rhetoric is bullshit. We're not headed into a tech utopia where the majority of the working class is coding and we all make 100,000 a year. This is simply a device used to make us believe the meritocracy and free market are still working as planned and anyone who fails miserably due to automation and layoffs is simply too dumb and lazy to retrain.

They say they can't do that because it's too crowded. I'm thinking ""well this whole place is crowded,"" but whatever, I said it would be 30-45 minutes before they got a table. They looked pissed off, but that's normal when people are told they have to wait. They took a seat.

Maybe ten minutes later another couple comes in. They had a reservation and so I took them to their table right away. When I get back to the host stand, one of the girls who was waiting was sobbing. Not crying, but visibly heaving and shaking like she just found out someone had died. 

I'm not a monster so I went over and asked what was wrong and if we could help. That's when I noticed the other girl was filming me with her phone. Normally we tell people to stop right away but I basically froze. 

Then the other girl started screaming so loud the entire place got quiet. She said I had discriminated against them. She said I the restaurant was biphobic. I was panicking because this is the best job I've ever had and I had no idea what she was talking about. I said something like ""How would I know you're bi?"" 

I don't remember exactly what she said but she was mad that I had seated the ""cis couple"" before them. I explained that they had reservations and, now that I knew what going on was bullshit, I got a little mad and told them that if they wanted to get seated right away they should have made reservations. She said she tried but our ""shitty ass website"" (which is an accurate description) didn't let her. I explained how you have to call, and she said she can't call strangers because of her anxiety and that along with being biphobic we were also ableist.

By this point the manager came out and angrily told them to get the fuck out. He's a big dude and they didn't fight him. But they did send the video to the owner the next day demanding to know my name and all of my social media and told him they'd never come back if I wasn't fired. He told them to fuck off, and so far I haven't seen the video on social media so thank god for that.",charmingyoungman05,t2_jbxais75,0.98,520,130

>Kacie Margis, a model and artist, first learned about Dan Price in 2020 the way many people do: through social media posts that celebrated his progressive politics.Five years earlier, Mr. Price had propelled himself to an unlikely position for the head of a 110-person payment processing company when he told his employees that he was raising their minimum pay to $70,000. His announcement was covered by The New York Times and NBC News.His self-styled role as a C.E.O. speaking truth about corporate greed resonated with a wide audience. His posts on social media had been liked tens of millions of times. He joked with Kelly Clarkson on her daytime talk show, with Lionel Richie looking on. He introduced Andrew Yang to a Seattle crowd during Mr. Yang’s presidential campaign. He video chatted with former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, who called him “the one moral CEO in America.” Mr. Price was a young, handsome executive whose worldview spoke to her; a real live influencer on social media who criticized the excesses and arrogance of other business leaders. He posted a seemingly endless stream on Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn, saying the right things about inequality. About mental health. About women.

>Soon, they were talking regularly. Mr. Price visited her near San Diego and flew her to Seattle. But what started as a whirlwind courtship ended three months later with an accusation of rape. On Monday, the police in Palm Springs, Calif., said they had referred Ms. Margis’s case to local prosecutors, recommending a charge of rape of a drugged victim. Prosecutors in Seattle earlier this year charged Mr. Price with assault in another incident.

Dan Price was a man known for saying the ""right things"" on social media. He was the ""one good CEO"". That didn't stop a torrent of accusations from spilling out about him, of course. It seems that we have seen this same process happen over and over again.",Vided,t2_533lvi3q,0.97,452,89
249,za63z4,2022-12-02,stupidpol,"The Railroad Strike would present a critical juncture in the history of the nation -- let alone labor -- if they go ahead and do it illegally, and they should.","I wouldn't blame the workers if they don't do this or just decide to resign en masse (there are already unprecedented resignations in the industry). People have families. The security state is far more advanced than it ever was in the later 19th/early 20th century. They *will* attack.

Yet, there is simply no avoiding the fact that illegal strikes and a lot of dirty play (let's say, for example, rail workers sabotage lines) are necessary. Power isn't going to just give up anything, not a single thing. It is naive in the extreme to think otherwise, such as to be historically illiterate.

They'd likely need even broader public support, however, and the support of many other unions as well. Breaking the picket line needs to be a serious offense shamed and punished in the way same way it once was over 100 years ago.

I try to discuss this with middle-class liberals I know, the same types who King would have written about in jail. While they profess to care for the poor and support labor, the fact is that you can't both support rail workers and support Democrats.

Democrats don't ever get anything done not because they're blocked, but because they don't want to and are generally openly anti-labor. If the only time you promote policies that would help working-class people (such as this or the failed student loan forgiveness) is when it's very predictable it will fail rather than when you have the power or opportunity, you're gaslighting voters.

To continue supporting or defending Biden when he is attacking workers like this is to self-identify as an elitist with no love or care for the poor. These are the same liberals who continue to speak of Reagan's evils from decades ago; Biden here is mimicking Reagan's treatment of the air traffic control strikers, a monumental moment in modern American political history that left us all poorer.

'Demonstrate a baseline consistency in values,' I'll suggest to them, but since Biden has been elected, liberals haven't seemed to have the courage to so much as attempt a feeble answer to the abuses of their sports team. That Biden is a cruel, petty corporate sycophant was obvious throughout his political history, yet people who ostensibly care about the poor continue to offer their support even as he and the party continue to viciously hurt families.

It has to be illegal. It has to come at a cost. There is just no other way anymore. Labor needs to get its balls back, and we collectively have to unplug from what Terrance McKenna once called 'shit-brained thinking' generated by an electronic \[corporate\] media that today has become so ubiquitous as to see people marching themselves into the slaughter house:

*""We have to stop consuming our culture. We have to create culture. Don't watch TV. Don't read magazines. Don't even listen to NPR. Create your own roadshow.""*

Labor has to 'create its own roadshow' or this country is simply doomed. Part of that will have to include unplugging from liberal media, liberal credetialism, liberal essentialism, moralism, and 'values,' grabbing at the power labor has with little to no regard for the 'laws' written by a class of businessmen and lawyers who can only be described as genocidal (note that by 'liberal,' I include 'neoliberalism' in my meaning, which in my view encompasses most of the country's 'conservative' and centrist politics).

I know that for many members of this sub, this is preaching to the choir. Basic materialist analysis. But historical moments like this impress upon us all the urgency of action in the face of unconscionable evil.

I agree that the barriers are absolutely tremendous, that we are dealing with a new kind of digital oppression, but since the alternative is increasing death and destitution, there is no choice but to try and find a way.

250,dw0voe,2019-11-14,stupidpol,Regarding that video about sex work,"[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mze4aOzOxL4&feature=youtu.be) was recently [posted on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/dvmh1e/a_financial_breakdown_of_my_life_as_a_sex_worker/). I was expecting to be at least pissed off by its content, but while watching I found it to be jaw-droppingly disgusting. Here's a quick breakdown of what I was so blown away by. 

I'll begin with the presentation. It's no different than any of the thousands of cleanly animated, cutesy, and zippy informative videos from lib outlets like Vox or right-wing propagandists like Prager. Professional and calmly narrated, it aims to make sex work seem totally unobjectionable  and mundane. ""Look, here's why I do it, here's how I do it, and here's why it's good."" In short, the video is above all else meant to legitimize sex work and make criticism of it seem unreasonable. 

The narrator begins with her ""confession"" that she was ""fired from her 9-5 office job and went into sex work to pay the bills,"" (0:05). She had considerable credit card debt and a low credit score as well. After she ""spent the week applying for every job I found,"" (0:24) she decided to engage in sex work when no employer showed interest. The first point that stood out to me was that she worked in an office. I'd like some more details on this to get a clearer idea of her class position, but I think it's fair to say she wasn't stuck in some service industry or hard blue collar work. Second point of note: she only spent a *week* applying for jobs? Look, I know from experience that the job market sucks but come on, that's all the time you're willing to spend? Anecdotal, but I've almost never been contacted by an employer within a week of applying. Of course she did note her debt and that is a very stressful position to be in, so perhaps she needed money fast. 

Next, she describes the basics of the erotic massage parlor, or ""Studio"", that she began working for. In her words it ""a high end studio,"" (0:53) with fairly high rates averaging $120-260 CAD for a massage, with a premium for extras. We see that she's not fucking guys off Backpage (or whatever is used now) in some motel for cash, but instead is paid to sexually gratify men following a massage. 

It's from here on that this shit started to boil my blood. Our narrator says her boss is sure that she knows her worth and even has a saying for it: ""Bitches don't go on sale,"" (1:10). Very cool, she has a woke pimp! You see, strict pricing is enforced across all girls working at the studio so nobody is undercut and everyone has a guaranteed minimum. We are assured that the narrator does not support human trafficking, and in fact all the girls are ""independent contractors,"" (1:34). 

The truly outrageous part of this video comes with the assertion that she and her coworkers ""are not forced to work at any time. We can refuse a client for any reason. Anyone getting a bad vibe from a studio or being forced to work without appropriate pay should seek legal help immediately,"" (1:40). This shit made me so pissed off. It completely ignores the financial coercion that makes anyone engage in work of any kind, but in this case it's the sale of one's own body. How many times have you heard some libertarian or garden-variety rightoid say some shit like ""If you don't like your job, just quit and find another!"" What's more, in *this very video* the narrator explained that it was financial struggles that led her to sex work in the first place! At 2:54 she expresses her desire to tell her family about her work, but feels she cannot because of how they would receive the news. Again, this is an indication that this popular conception of sex work only considers those with an at least somewhat materially comfortable background who have fallen into a financial slump. I don't want to minimize middle-class professionals with money troubles, but this is an excessively narrow view of the sex industry. 

A few stray points:

* Sex workers are never shown wearing any suggestive clothing, in fact most look like different varieties of yuppies. (3:23)
* Clients are all young, fashionable, good looking men (2:22, 4:55)
* Sex work is presented as a way to take control of your body/financial decisions (5:00)
* Slow economy? Don't worry about the machinations of the global economy and how they make your life miserable, just fuck for money until Google opens up a new office! (4:00)
* Speaking of Google, the talk of freedom (2:34) and employer provided leisure time reminds me heavily of silicon valley ""fun"" work culture bullshit. (3:32) 
* She goes into an extended segment offering financial management tips while lightly admonishing women for frivolous spending. Implication of course being that this experience taught her to be responsible with her money. (4:10)

In case I didn't make it clear, I hated this bullshit. It's like they're trying to fold prostitution into some gig economy bs like dog walking or uber or whatever else. Contractors, ""fun"" workplaces, flexible employment. You're free to come and go when you please, and remember! Threat of poverty is *not* coercion.

252,16sotzv,2023-09-26,stupidpol,Classic Marxian Texts: Harry Braverman’s Labor and Monopoly capital.,"This post is an attempt to raise the general level of discussion in the sub and orient it into a Marxist direction. Harry Braverman was an industrial worker born into a working class parents, he first worked as a copper smith and pipe fitter in naval docks. Thereafter he moved into employment in steel shops in Ohio. After this Braverman became the editor of The American Socialist and later editor and Vice president of Groove Press, which published Malcom X’s biography. Braverman thereafter until his death would serve as the editor of Monthly Review Press, the book publishing division of Monthly Review.

Labor and Monopoly Capital is by far his most widely read work. Marx had completely and devastatingly analyzed the labor process in the first volume of capital. And as such post Marx, Marxists rarely needed to concern themselves with the labor process. They concentrated on other “peripheral” issues imperialism, the nature of the state under capitalism, ideology and the national question. This acquiesce robbed Marxism of it’s fiery living blood, which was the analysis of contradictions of the labor process under capitalist production, which caused the rest: alienation, exploitation and the other stuff of interest.

It was left until 1974 when Braverman published this book to reorient Marxist analysis. But in the meantime bourgeois apologist in economics and sociology was able to concoct phoney justifications of capitalist and managerial domination in the workplace. Tacitly it was helped by the fact that the Soviet Union basically mirrored the capitalist world at the level of work organization.

At the level of theory Braverman contributed nothing which was not originally in Marx (except his analysis of Scientific management), but simply pointed out the relevant ideas to sleeping “academic Marxists”. As Paul Sweezy said in the introduction of the book,

> In terms of theory, as he would be the first to say, there is very little that is new in this book. In terms of knowledge gained from the creative application of theory, there is an enormous amount that is new, and much of it in direct contradiction to what capitalist ideology has succeeded in establishing as the society’s conventional wisdom.

In the book Braverman i) clarified the difference hierarchically imposed division of labor within the firm as opposed to the social division of labor ii) exposed scientific management not as humanist, universalist philosophy and science of work but a capitalist innovation to outstrip the worker of his craft knowledge and concentrate it in the hands of management iii) leading to immiseration of the worker and creation of large undifferentiated labor force iv) how capitalist had taken the services of science to remold the labor process in all it’s dimensions to routinize, deskill and mechanize the worker.

The consequence of this was polarizing in academia. Although the book was hailed as a classic, first it did reorient some of the Marxist to look more closely to the managerial domination in the labor process, in economics this lead to good work by people like Sam Bowles, Richard Edwards, Michael Gordon and others. While in sociology at first it lead to “Bravermania” but in England all of Braverman’s fantastic insight was proven wrong by post modernist critiques (not joking, one “Marxist” critique alleged since Braverman took a objective view of class thus he was unable to deliver insight into the subjective conditions of workers, unsurprisingly this commentor was chosen to review Braverman’s book when the ASA made a list of 20 most influential sociology books between 1970-2000). Elsewhere in history especially Business history and Labor history (the new labor history) this book had a decisive effect, it provided a radical counterpart to conservative bourgeois history being pioneered by Alfred Chandler. David Noble, Hugh Aitken, Richards Edwards wrote Braverman influenced history. In labor history David Montgomery, Katherine Stone, Herbert Gutman usually cited the work.

Think of this post as an advertisement to read the book. Braverman analyzed the second Industrial Revolution completely and showed how in Marx’s phrase capital had moved from the formal to the real domination of labor. A patron saint of the sub Christopher Lasch was actually ecstatic of the book, you can find a blurb of his review in the back of the book. He also sought to extend the analysis of capitalist domination through technical managerial class to the family, see his Haven in a heartless world. His student David Noble, wrote two very important books one about the business organization of science for industrial control and profit and another of the social history of industrial automation (recently after obscurity and scorn the top r/neoliberal economist Daron Acemoglu has used used Noble’s work quite liberally in his technology book). Similarly both Acemoglu and Autor in their task based model of automation leading to wage polarization come to pretty much the same conclusion as Braverman (ie the automation of semi skilled labor which is replaced by large no of low skilled and small number of high skilled workers). 

Except in their framework excessive automation is caused for the following [reasons](https://imgur.com/3vKeuDX), while for Braverman, it is because of the contradictions of capitalist production (ie antagonistic interests of capital and labor and therefore capitalist’s need to control labor),

> The evolution of machinery represents an expansion of human capacities, an increase of human control over environment through the ability to elicit from instruments of production an increasing range and exactitude of response. But it is in the nature of machinery, and a corollary of technical development, that the control over the machine need no longer be vested in its immediate operator. This possibility is seized upon by the capitalist mode of production and utilized to the fullest extent. What was mere technical possibility has become, since the Industrial Revolution, an inevitability that devastates with the force of a natural calamity, although there is nothing more “natural” about it than any other form of the organization of labor. Before the human capacity to control machinery can be transformed into its opposite, a series of special conditions must be met which have nothing to do with the physical character of the machine. The machine must be the property not of the producer, nor of the associated producers, but of an alien power. The interests of the two must be antagonistic.

Braverman does not stop from critiquing Soviet labor process, [here he is on the famous Engel’s On Authority cited all the time by infantile leftists on the internet](https://imgur.com/z1SShNd). Similarly Braverman called Taylorism, “the very verbalization of capitalist means of production” and Fordism the “mechanical equivalent” this pales in comparison to [Lenin’s explicit avowal of Taylorism and](https://faculty.lsu.edu/bedeian/files/the-taylorization-of-lenin-rhetoric-or-reality.pdf) his political maneuvering to institute it in Russia and in general USSRs focus on heavy capital intensive industry. The book has lessons for socialists in all positions.

The lesson third world socialist should take is: i) to stop mindlessly aping western development and be cognizant about the relationship between particular forms of technology and organization ii) think twice before destroying the craft heritage and knowledge in their society (by reducing a vast mass of people into proletarians) and willy nilly replacing it with mass mechanized production. The lesson for first world socialists is this: i) there can never not even temporarily be capital labor pact ii) there is a tradeoff between mass illth production and workers control iii) workers control cannot be simply democracy in the workplace but each worker has to internalize and understand the very production process they are engaged with completely and they therefore are equal amongst each other.

This book fits very well with r/stupidpol and our critiques of PMC, Barbara Ehrenreich who coined the term PMC also engaged with this work.

253,13k2u2g,2023-05-17,stupidpol,"The feminist challenge to socialist history: why patriarchy theory is both ahistorical, and problematic to leftist class theory","This is an interesting paper about some of the debates in feminism around the history of women and society. It's written from the feminist perspective by a feminist, but in many ways it argues against some of the issues that people in this community find troubling with feminism: patriarchy theory, and the post-structural or epistemological approach to history (which is the foundation for much of what we refer to as critical theory or ""wokeism"").

Patriarchy theory is the view that men work together to organize or control society to oppress women. Radical feminists have tried (and often succeeded) to establish this as a fundamental pattern throughout all of human history.

Patriarchy theory was historically a direct backlash against Marxism, straight into idpol, by replacing class oppression with gender based oppression.

It directly contradicts Marxist class theory, which posits that the ruling class oppresses the working class by extracting surplus value from them.  In particular, the ruling class is made up of both men and women, and the working class is made up of both men and women.  Men as a class do not oppress women as a class. And logically speaking, patriarchy theory and Marxist class theory cannot both be true at the same time.

At the core of the paper is an analysis of gender segregation during the rise of capitalism and industrialization in the UK. Many feminists have tried to make the argument that men saw women as natural enemies in the workplace and sought to pass legislation to limit competition and force women into a more subservient role at home.

There are many factual problems with this interpretation though.  Most notably is the fact that female employment actually increased through most of the industrial revolution, and the fact that men usually enjoyed and preferred the company of women at work.  And when feminists have found evidence of men supposedly flexing their muscles to force women out of the workplace, a more sober analysis usually finds other conclusions.

In particular, most of the cited examples come from the context of worker's rights and the broader socialist movement, where women and children often got the better end of the deal with protective legislation that usually excluded men (who were sometimes part of the legislation during earlier drafts but then left out later). While it's true that this did have the effect of pushing some women out of the workforce and into the home, which did establish a kind of ""patriarchal"" division of labor that became stereotypical in middle class families in the 20th century, the author sees this as a natural consequence and outcome of historical trends during this period.  It was more of a benefit or trade-off for women, especially in the context of maternity and child birth.  Not some kind of conspiracy among men to establish patriarchal control over capitalism and industrial society.  She also argues that the reintroduction of women as quasi breadwinners in the family unit later in the 20th century came about as a result of a breakdown in market stability inside of capitalism, not from feminist activism.

She refers to this interpretation of history as the materialistic interpretation, which draws heavily from Marxist class theory. And she argues that it is overall superior to other feminist interpretations of history.

255,eltunf,2020-01-08,stupidpol,I applied to a job to 'help stop homelessness',"The application was an ideological test, beginning with asking ""What do you think causes homelessness?"". To which I gave the only correct answer, Real Estate. 

&#x200B;

Humans have been able to make homes since before we became Homo Sapiens. Homes predate civilization. They were bad, but still better than plastering industrial foam over wet concrete and sleeping in the small crook of the door to Starbucks. With the tools and free knowledge available today, anyone with a somewhat able body could build a house with no need to be robbed monthly by a landlord whose industry purposefully sets the price of 'affordable' units to steal most of a minimum wage worker's paycheck. OR by a bank that owns houses set to the loans market, so that it can take an entire lifetime to pay off but by common probability they will not be able to keep paying and will end up back in the hands of the bank, ready to mortgage out to the next loser. 

This is something that Capitalism can't compete against anyone with, it's an industry that cannot survive without the police enforcing it violently and constantly and it's the source of a great deal of unearned, parasitic income.

&#x200B;

Is racism the answer?   
First look at this, it's a heavily weighted graph adjusted for total population size:  [https://endhomelessness.org/resource/racial-disparities-homelessness-united-states/](https://endhomelessness.org/resource/racial-disparities-homelessness-united-states/) 

Then look at this:  [https://www.statista.com/statistics/555855/number-of-homeless-people-in-the-us-by-race/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/555855/number-of-homeless-people-in-the-us-by-race/) 

In order words homelessness most affects Blacks, then Whites. The majority of people who need this help are black, and then white and then other minor groups. They're \*\*ALL\*\* poor. 100% of them are poor.

When businesses like endhomelessness create marketable lies like this, they do it because they're selling a service to their donors. You get to donate to an anti-racist organization, and in return they'll never fucking end homelessness. This is the exact type of organization I was applying to and it makes me sick.

No-one who cares about homelessness would go out their way to spit on white homeless people like this, because there's no need to if you're trying to fix the problem. (endhomelessness described the issue as something whites are 'underrepresented in' along with asians because of the ratio of homeless to non-homeless whites)

Both graphs showed racial disparity, the second one didn't take away from black people in any way and the solution is still getting rid of feudalistic landlording and making housing a human right.

&#x200B;

Is substance abuse the answer? Rich people do coke in their homes constantly and no-one cares, spoiled rich instawhores bouncing from hotel to hotel highlight their drug use non-stop online, and weed is a permanent part of american suburban culture, no-one cares when it isn't in public, on the street, where you have to deal with it and see it. It's horrifying when someone is raving like an idiot or barely conscious on the street at 3 AM, but it's hilarious at a party or someone's House. There are a handful of people who have the choice between supporting their addiction by sucking dick, day labor, and stealing or to pay rent and they do choose their addiction - at the end of the day the premise that this person has to be a tenant-slave in order to have the most basic accommodation of civilization is still ridiculous. 

No, substance abuse is not the cause of Homelessness.

Probably the worst take of all time is that Sexism causes homelessness. MEN make up the majority of homeless and are in the most danger while homeless and often for the exact same tear-jerking reasons that Women are. Anyone who tries to claim that misogyny is behind homelessness hates the homeless and never wants to solve it. What they want is what I want, but only for women. The problem however is that when you give only one group of people an entitlement, they will employ it to abuse the disenfranchised and women are already doing this by exploiting the domestic abuse industry. Here's a couple of facts that makes liberals intensely uncomfortable. 

Men lose their housing in domestic disputes far more often than women.

Over 80% of restraining orders are being used to intentionally cause harm with no legitimacy. Guess what you can do with an order of protection - that's right, evict someone. Every domestic abuse business in the country advises the use of orders of protection in every situation. Constantly. Then it becomes even harder to get employment and housing.

Most of the resources spent on at-risk Men are spent on sending them to jail for the profit of that industry, which is even more disgusting than what I'm writing about now and also affects the poor for essentially the same reason : free labor, the endless demand of the rich to have slavery.

Sexism is a huge problem, for Men, but not the source of homelessness. 

This isn't a secret MRA fact, this is stuff I learned in my feminist as fuck school. It's right there for everyone to see, yet no-one 'sees' it or takes part in consciously covering it up. There were tons of feminists in my classes. When you see people who 'want to help women and only women' going into an industry with mostly male clients, it's extremely disturbing. This was only a minor course for me and not my major, which is too bad. The right people are chased away for knowing what the problem is while true idiots are kept in to work at profiteering ""non-profits"" that can never solve any problems.

Plenty of labor IS forced. The fact that people have to work multiple jobs to get basic things like food and healthcare is an example of real forced labor. And real forced labor isn't even remotely comparable to you being expected to emotionally support someone that you CHOOSE to be in a relationship with. 

If supporting someone you claim to love feels like a chore then why are you even in a relationship with them to begin with? The end goal of complaining about so called emotional labor is the commidification of things like friendship and romance, which is honestly one of the most distopian things I can imagine.

261,y2cwtf,2022-10-12,stupidpol,Quick Rundown : French fuel refinery employees strikes amidst record high company profits. Government ORDERS them to go back to work.,"I haven't seen a single thread concerning this event and that fact alone, I consider it pretty blackpilling considering I'm not the most well-written english speaker here. Anyway, here's a quick rundown :

1. TotalEnergies have record high profits this year thanks to spike in energy prices, particularly oil.
2. TotalErergies decides to give an ""exceptional advance payment"" of 2,62 billions € to shareholders.
3. Total workers decides that they should get at least some part of the cake, considering inflation, profits etc. They they go on a strike where they have a pretty big leverage, considering they are qualified workers in a critical industry.
4. The strikes are actually being felt by the whole population right now. Even in my province city, you can observe long snaking queues. One of the rhetoric used by the neoliberal clique is that Total workers shouldn't complain, because they are supposed to be quite well paid. One argument they use is that the average salary in Total is 5000€ per month, while the average salary in France is less than 1800€. Using ""average"" instead of ""median"" is fallacious by itself, considering those that are currently striking are those that are paid 2000-2500€, not the 10 000€ super managers or something. Infortunately, to a lot of ""crab in the bucket"" proles that conflate servility with dignity, the rhetoric works. Not to all, fortunately, but hey, that's individualism and atomization for you.
5. Total high management refuse to give in to workers demands, instead starting to block the whole country. Here is an example of troubles cause by the shortage. **Note that the shortage is actually massive and felt by the whole country :** [**https://twitter.com/khalediskef/status/1580075412578656262**](https://twitter.com/khalediskef/status/1580075412578656262) ( even arabic countries are making fun of us )
6. Instead of applying pressure to Total management, the Macron government simply decide to step on the Right to Strike and start ""requisition"" of essentials workers. Basically, if you refuse to work while being ""requisitioned"", you're liable for a 10 000€ fine and even jail. In fucking France.
7. For fucking once, this decision is so incredibly infuriating that even usually useless unions are joining the strike. Rumors of a general strike are being heard right now.

**TLDR : Neoliberalism at it's finest in France. Even when workers have the means to engage in a power struggle, the government will spit on the constitution and freedom of strike to push it's agenda and their friends shareholders interest. But this isn't over yet and may evolve into a general strike at this point. The proles are being pushed around too fast, too hard, with too much disdain.**

Yesterday, my workplace had a big meeting. About a hundred people were in an auditorium. We weren't talking about DEI or CRT or anything like that. The discussion was supposed to introduce us to new, institution-wide initiatives.

During the course of a single hour, various speakers and audience members made the following claims, all of which were met with uniform affirmation:

* All surgeries and medical procedures trace their roots to anti-black eugenics
* Doctors are trained to believe that black people are a different species
* There exists a nation-wide network of white kidnappers who abduct ""hundreds of thousands"" of black American children each year
* Before colonization ""all of Africa"" shared a single, unified culture and there were no wars
* Before colonization, Africans had no understanding of personal property or forms of currency (ironically, this line used to be popular with Stormfront posters and apartheid apologists)

This list doesn't even include more popular insane arguments, like that the average lifespan of a trans woman is 35 or that all policing started with slave patrols.

Again, no one expressed the slightest bit of outward skepticism toward any of this stuff. 

Is this unique to my workplace, or have you noticed similar trends?

The separation of labor from the fruits of that labor, being treated like an economic cog, not feeling true ""ownership"" of your labor power etc. That makes sense. But i'm struggling to see how that's a fundamental component of capitalism rather than something inherent to modern industrial production.

Contrast the above with the way things worked in the USSR. It was ostensibly a worker's state, sure. But from the standpoint of the common worker it seemed... significantly more alienating (if the word is being used with real meaning and not as technical theory jargon) when you start looking at the elements of the soviet labor system.

1. Anti-parasitism laws meant any able bodied adult was required by law to work or face legal punishment.

2. The ""job by distribution"" system for new graduates meant that you were assigned a job and required to stay there for a period of time. The system wasn't completely irrational like some people make it out to be, your skills and abilities and desires were usually taken into account. But not always. And the top jobs usually required some sort of connections to get.

3. The internal passport system made it a pain in the ass to move or find jobs in other cities. Not impossible, but still a pain. This was worse for peasants as they weren't given passports until the mid 70s. The government didn't want peasants to flood the cities and they didn't want skilled professionals to bail on the outlying provinces. 

So your movement is restricted, you're required to work under threat of legal punishment, and your ability to choose your profession is pretty limited. And all of this is at the direction of a monolithic state that you have pretty limited direct control over.

Doesn't that seem... really fucking dystopian and terrible? Most criticisms of the Soviet union focus on Stalin and the purges or famines or gulags, but even post-Stalin when economic growth was strong and things were generally peaceful it sounds like a pretty dreary and miserable place to be a worker. At least in hellworld America I could pack my shit and go be a cog for some other group of oligarchs instead of feeling like my entire life is being controlled by an impossibly huge institution of near limitless power.

It’s not a small conference and it aligns with militant trade unionism, socialism, and rank and file approaches; all subjects that I thought would interest this sub. I considered making a post about it, but it was sold out by that time and it felt pointless doing so. 

This conference was incredible. The amount of young people energized about organizing their workplaces. The confluence of young and old trade unionists and the respect I saw given to the veterans of the struggle from youths that weren’t even born when their fight started. The energy and feeling that the labor movement is in for an amazing upsurge. 

And the discussions. Incredible, tactics and strategy. How to strike effectively, how to violate labor law and maintain the security of pensions. How to harass the boss, how to make the capitalist class pay. I saw blood in the air. People are thirsty for change. 

I also saw very little dumb woke shit. I spoke freely to my Teamster brothers about my thoughts. I discussed socialism and the need to organize around working class issues and language. And it wasn’t vaguely controversial. 

I also spoke to some heroic women from the Philippines who organized a Union for call center workers. I spoke particularly with one. She told me that she was arrested, her lawyer stabbed in the face. Her friends killed. Her ￼buildings raided. Her life threatened. And most incredibly, she is going back. With an active court case against her, facing 10 years in prison for planted guns. She couldn’t abandon the struggle and her people. I was in awe. 

This woman, who couldn’t be taller than 4’ 10”, who has six children and struggles everyday against a government funded and armed by US imperialism, she shouldn’t care about American workers. But when Comunication workers went on strike, she organized a solidarity strike, and vowed that they wouldn’t be used as scabs. 

I would like to see some of you here at the next  Labor Notes, to get inspired and educated. To agitate on the shop floor and build class consciousness.￼ For dignity on and off the job.

""I'm a sex worker and..."" and ""I have friends who are sex workers, and..."" it occurred to me that it could be really difficult to know what precisely anyone was talking about or arguing for/against.

I don't know exactly when it was determined that terms like ""prostitute,"" ""stripper,"" ""camgirl,"" ""porn star"" were demeaning to their subjects and must be replaced by the catch-all euphemism ""sex worker,"" but a consequence of the shift has been the distortion of any conversation involving any or all of those jobs. Person A could say something like ""sex work is inherently harmful, etc."" and be speaking with prostitution and hardcore pornography in mind; Person B could reply ""well my friend is a sex worker and she's doing very well for herself"" and be talking about someone who pole dances or gets naked on camera.  It seems to me there's a difference in kind between, say, receiving a one-time payment from a stranger in exchange for penetrative sex and receiving payment from cloud-mediated strangers in exchange for nude photos of oneself (a similar distinction exists between ""impoverished runaway under the thumb of organized crime"" and ""adventurous grad student in NYC who gets to pick and choose""), but it's hard to have a nuanced discussion about any of it when it's all made fungible under the ""sex worker"" classification.

Like anyone with a set of eyeballs and over the age of 30, I have been tracking the evolution of the family as presented to television audiences. 

It is well known that for a very long time “media”in general  lagged behind reality in this regard. The entire planet was white and straight with clearly defined cookie cutter roles. This began to change in in the 70s and then accelerated dramatically as we exited the 80s. 

In the 90s and 2000s I would posit that the universe as reflected on television was pretty close to mirroring the actual diversity of at least the United States. I mean this in regard to representation on a statistical basis. Obviously diffferent products have different target demographics. This is not what I am referencing. 

I think that it should be a non-controversial observation to point out that this is no longer reality and has not been for a time. There is an over representation of just about everything. I won’t get into the “why” behind this as it isn’t germane to this particular discussion.

""
For those of you industry and non industry friends following this story. I unfortunately have some first hand insight. :(


My thoughts are regret that I didn't say something earlier when I worked for this production company -Thomasville Pictures- in Feburary as a Thomasville Local. When I and multiple department heads including the prop master expressed shock for safety issues and poor planning concerning the very basics of set safety and common sense to multiple producers and were dismissed or just outright taken off the department head meeting schedule (no pay) or off the days shoot entirely.


1. This was totally avoidable. There are safety protocols in place, which is why this tragedy is so rare. Non industry but Thomasville friends... think Union Job.


2. I worked for this production company #ThomasvillePictures as a SAG Aftra stunt coordinator this year. I raised safety concerns during my employment. That was my job. I was not asked to be a part of their future projects. I had to educate producers on blanks, Class C explosives licence for SPFX department head, and numerous other concerns from car hits to any other type of crap you could think of. They had no idea what they were doing. I wouldn't let them around a horse none the less a gun. They dont know how to make the movies they are making.

3. This was a real gun and real bullet on set. Unforgivable.


4. The gun was taken for target practice by the propmasters daughter before filming. Ridiculous.


5. The gun was not checked on set. Insane.


6. The producers hired non union crew to film that day when their crew walked out for safety concerns the day before. That's when filming should have stopped.


7. There is a difference between a prop master and an armorer for a reason. They know better. Because I told them in Feburary.


8. The producers are responsible and ultimately negligent for hiring non union workers and not checking their work. Manslaughter.


9. Alec Baldwin is a union actor and a producer on the film Rust. Hes one of the bosses.


10. Thomasville Pictures is an unsafe production company. They cut corners and didnt hire union professionals. Thomasville let's them do everything for free. They got someone killed and should never be allowed to make movies again.


11. The prop master of the film One Way walked off of set for safety concers. Just like this movie. Foreshadowing 
How many people need to walk off a movie set or say they feel unsafe before a producer will listen?


Send your thoughts and prayers to the families of Halyna Hutchins and Joel Souza not the producers of this film. It's not an accident. Its negligence. They dont know what they are doing. Everyone should claim responsibility for their incompetence instead of filming a western when they dont even know basic set or weapon safety. The best outcome is that these producers aren't allowed to make anymore movies and send every $ they saved being cheap to the child of Halyna Hutchins.""",Leandover,t2_bdsc9,0.99,211,111

285,ii117b,2020-08-28,stupidpol,"""unskilled labor"" and automation","There have been a couple issues in left/liberal circles I've seen online in the last few years or so that I haven't seen addressed satisfactorily by any pedantic guys, to my knowledge: the idea of ""unskilled labor"" as an epithet, and the idea that job loss through automation is a myth.

1. Obviously, ""skilled"" and ""unskilled"" labor are technical terms, and it's more useful to think of the delineation between the two as a gradient rather than some discrete method of sorting jobs by prestige or whatever. No matter how socially necessary a given job is, the best way of assessing the skill involved in that job is the depth of the labor pool that can readily replace any given worker in that field. That's why a vegetable picker is ""unskilled"" and a graphic designer is ""skilled"": even though the former is part of the bedrock of food supply chains that undergird civilization as we know it and the latter is more than likely the kind of contemptible PMC ad industry barnacle we all despise, the fact of the matter is that any able-bodied human could slot into the former's position with virtually zero training, but jobs like the latter require hundreds or thousands of hours of training to acquire fluency with the requisite software and the language of design, etc (to say nothing of the bullshit credentialism that goes along with any white-collar job)
2. When people think of ""automation"", they're thinking of a robot or an algorithm that takes your job wholesale, and skeptics are right to say that, for most industries, that type of job loss is a bit of a millenarian paranoia, or at least further along the timeline than most people believe. What generally isn't being talked about when talking about automation is the lowering of the skill barrier for any given job. Even something like, say, delivering pizza used to have at least some skill component: compared to a veteran, a new delivery driver in the not-so-distant era before widely available GPS would likely have some significant latency period familiarizing themself with the layout of the local town or city, and therefore wasn't immediately interchangable with just any schmuck who needs a job. Now, with instant, free maps and directions available to everyone, the pool of labor that can replace a delivery boy or a taxi driver \*with no perceptible latency in training\* and instantly provide full value suddenly becomes much larger. The result is, of course, less leverage on behalf of the worker and everything that goes along with that. This is, I suppose, a sort of supply-side automation, where by virtue of a job's specific skills becoming less rigorous, the supply of available labor increases. There's also the case of technological advances decreasing demand for labor, which is probably more intuitive: say the pinnacle of lawnmowing technology is the reel mower, and some large estate needs to employ 5 groundskeepers in order to mow the whole thing. Now, the riding mower is invented, and a single man can suddenly do the full job in the same amount of time.

I'm posting this because with all of the Activision/Blizzard controversy, there seems to be a laser focus on ""toxic work culture"" in the video game industry. This article focuses on Bungie, and uses sources of former and current anonymous Bungie employees, describing wanton sexism, repeated put-downs of women/minorities, and implied prevention of women from reaching leadership roles or getting promotions. There was also the usual shitty workplace stuff like crunch, erratic management, etc. However, the sources stress that the environment was significantly better than a place like Activision, and some people didn't experience anything inappropriate at all:
>Among many of our sources was a cognizance that, in a strange way, Bungie was better than many other game studios. Few people were aware of any overt physical harassment or assault, and a few barely encountered any inappropriate behavior at all during their time at the company.

The sources also acknowledge that Bungie has taken significant steps towards resolving the perceived inequities, by pushing out managers/leads that had bad reps in the company, and having a focus over the last few years on diversity and inclusion (they even have a formal position as a D&I director).

Here was a quote that I found very relevant to this subreddit, and I thought was worthy of discussion:
>A former employee remarked that it was all too often the job of the minorities at the studio to educate everyone else — a job that inevitably meant doing extra unpaid labor at best and which some sources who did that work say was often dismissed or ignored. Another source put it concisely: ""People are willing to learn, but wouldn't it be so nice to be somewhere where everyone already knows?""

Why isn't the fact that their co-workers are willing to learn enough? I'm sorry but I find the above statement a total bs cop-out, and brought me to the question of ""What is enough?"" for people waging an idpol crusade.

288,1960y5s,2024-01-13,stupidpol,The Tech Worker: an exercise in eating from the trashcan of ideology," The tech worker is an interesting breed. In many ways, a throw back to a different era of American capitalism before it had been gutted and de-industrialized into the sprawling rust belts that scar the nation. The tech worker represents that thorn of industrial capitalism that it successfully excised from itself. The skilled worker who cannot be replaced by machinery yet is an integral part of the commodity being created. In a world where the vast majority of the industrial proletariat had been replaced by the care-worker proletariat and the service-proletariat, the tech worker was able to rise above others in ways not seen before. But why? 

As Marx so brightly pointed out, the profit rate has a tendency to fall over time. Across all industry in the developed world, we have seen Marx proven correct (see: rising organic composition of capital). The profitability across industry led investors to sit on their capital rather than throw it at investments that would return peanuts. It is rather unlikely that a given industry reverses the trend, large leaps in profitability are most often the result of new industry entering the market or a qualitative change in existing industry effectively making it a new industry. 

The tech industry is unique in the following ways: at the outset, the means of production necessary to start a tech product/company were reasonably attainable, meaning the race started with many players. The utility of the tech was undeniable and could lead to reducing labor costs across all other industries. And most important of all, unlike traditional hard-good commodity production, scaling a tech company could be done by a small team, keeping labor costs down. The profitability potential of tech was great. We can of course talk about how a whole lot of the “we started in a garage” stories were nothing but stories, but that’s a different discussion (Bit Tyrants is a great book if you’re interested in learning the reality about some of these stories). 

Investors started heavily funding tech and it started to grow exponentially. However interests rates were still a factor and money did not flood in like it would after 2008. The market crash of 2008 exposed the fragility of the system and investors sat on their hoards of cash. In a desperate attempt to stimulate the economy, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to rock bottom. This resulted in investors being able to borrow for essentially free, and tech was flooded with investment. It was the perfect storm. Investors had cash burning holes in their accounts, and only one industry promised enticing returns. 

Almost daily one could read a story of so-and-so making an app, a sass product, etc and becoming millionaires overnight. Investor firms began investing in anything and everything, with the hopes that if just one of their investments became a “unicorn” (company valued at 1+billion USD), it would more than offset any of the investments that failed. An Iced tea company once announced a “pivot to blockchain” and their stock price shot up over 300%. A good moment to point out that a wealthy investor is not an oracle, but someone who was able to get in at a good time and got lucky. 

Companies in tech got used to this arrangement. Many firms did not even focus on turning a profit, they knew they’d have investor money to operate with, their goal was increasing market share. In what other industry could a company not make a profit for multiple years and still get investment? These companies had enough money to burn that they could offer large compensation packages often with stock, to tech workers. Especially since there were not enough workers to go around, compensation sky rocketed. 

*“I am already eating from the trashcan all the time. The name of this trashcan is* ***ideology.****”* 

*-Slavoj Zizek* 

The tech worker believed they had solved the problem, gamed the system, reached the promised land and so on. Most importantly they believed that their position was a result of their individual merit and not the result of a specific socio-historical and economic configuration that could not help but to come crashing down. If one reads message boards of tech workers of this era, one sees a common theme of libertarianism, and a strong anti union sentiment. “I can do better for myself than I could if I had to do it as a group”, and for a time it was somewhat true. Yet if life is anything, it is change. This is an era when we began the see the first cracks in the facade. From big firms being caught colluding to not hire from each other and fixing salaries, to the quiet end of “doing your own thing”. 

The winds began to change as tech matured. The dream of starting your own google soon gave way to the dream of selling to google. The tech industry is an industry like any other, and its capital concentrates and centralizes. Soon tech became dominated by a few firms, and the promise of freedom of expression and democracy in access soon gave way to walled gardens curated and controlled by large firms. Smaller tech firms didn’t, to use the favorite term of tech gurus, disrupt anything any more, if they had a good idea they were bought by the big boys. 

Yet tech workers kept the faith. They weren’t employees, they were part of a mission. They were valued for their abilities and contributions, and more importantly as people. They deluded themselves into thinking things would stay as they had, and more importantly that they were correct in their analysis in the first place. 

Tech had ballooned past its true value. It was the buoy that made our “roaring” stock market roar. It had become the saving grace of American capitalism, perhaps those stupid leftists were wrong all along. Here was an industry that came out of nowhere, became the dominant force of the economy, paid its people well, and was socially conscious and progressive. From wholehearted embrace of the LGBTQ community to giving generous parental leave in a country where such thing is anathema to culture. Tech gave cover to the rotting carcass of the structural crisis that is the American economy. It was the stripes on a paper tiger. 

Eventually something would tip the scales. 

Covid came out of no where. I remember watching a news story about some flu in China, then a few weeks later life would change forever. Covid’s disruption to daily life, most explicitly white collar work, and global capital flows led to another boom for tech. Tech firms became even more ingrained in our daily lives as large swaths of white collar workers were made to work from home. The necessary tech infrastructure needed to grow, and the large firms of tech went on a massive hiring spree in order to seize upon the moment. They grew fast and aggressively. While the rest of the market cratered, tech stocks shot up. 

However the covid situation was not only temporary, but it served to expose that rotting carcass that tech had been covering up. It showed the fragility of global capitalism, and allowed for the economy to go haywire. From valid price increases due to bottlenecks in global supply chains, to a perverse raising of prices by firms who had outside market share in their area for no reason other than that they could, inflation started to tick up and rapidly. 

*“The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch, the ruling ideas”* 

*- Antonio Gramci*

Inflation hurts us all. It devalues our money and must be dealt with. The question is how does one deal with it. Ultimately when dealing with inflation the question is not will someone be made to pay, that is a given. It is *who* will be made to pay. In the American response it was clear the working class will be the one who pays. Thus Jeremy Powell began to raise interest rates in an effort to “cool the economy” in order to slow inflation. To cool the economy meant to increase unemployment, in the round about way of making it more expensive to borrow so firms and investors would have less money with which to operate and hire. 

Now remember when I said tech was a bubble filled with free money thanks to a specific socio-historical and economic configuration?

As interest rates increased, the tech worker was hit. And hit hard. In 2023, there were 262,682 layoffs in tech. We’re approaching the end of the first two weeks of 2024 and so far 3,300 tech workers have been laid off. These workers did not get worse at their jobs, they’re just as skilled as when new graduates were being offered 100k+ out of school at Google. What changed is that the free money which buoyed tech is gone. It was never about how much value a worker gave to the company, it was never about being valued as a person and for unique personal insights. It was none of that which gave rise to the highly paid, comfortable, well treated tech worker. It was low interest rates and the low profitability of other industries. 

Now if you see tech worker communities the tone has changed dramatically from what it once was. Workers are talking about something the tech worker of 2014 would’ve (and did) laughed at: Unionization. 

Yet I fear that it is too late. The leverage tech workers once had is gone. The push to code was successful and the field is now not wanting for engineers. The tech worker let their self-serving reasoning as to their success, cloud their judgment of reality. They wanted to believe so badly in their uniqueness as indispensability, that they deluded themselves into believing things would never change. Yet, life *is* change.

Why do our offices now have decor that looks like a Montessori preschool, with lots of bright, basic colors? Why does work now involve such infantilization? I suspect it’s because companies are scared. We live in an age of chaos, a period when entire industries are collapsing.”

*Lab Rats* is a very good book about how Silicon Valley's managerial techniques are bleeding into the common workplace, and how it is detrimental to both employee welfare and productivity overall. It talks about how the idea of a work-life balance is being eclipsed by work-life *integration*, thanks to Silicon Valley CEOs.

 >“Unfortunately many of these new oligarchs seem to possess a decidedly anti-worker, and even anti-human worldview.” 

 Lyons explains that this trend of running employees as hard as possible until they crack comes from venture capitalist's view of how a company works, where they build short-term value and cash out at the IPO.

>""The [Venture Capitalists] and founders are not trying to build sustainable companies. So why should they care about providing employees with stable, long-term careers, or distributing wealth among the workers?”

293,107u66b,2023-01-09,stupidpol,The market working with only one hand — will there be an OnlyFans crash?,"""OnlyFans Girls"" are, as I've come to understand it, a relatively newish phenomenon. There have always been strippers, before that girls who posed for nude painting for money, later cam girls, etc. But people like the woman who could afford to buy [a house 19 due to paid nudity](https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/local-news/onlyfans-star-buys-200k-yorkshire-24264423), were rather rare before. The old feminist analysis of porn was that the movie producers were making the real money, and desperate women didn't get much. Even in recent history, this narrative remained plausible, with world-famous Mia Khalifa claiming to have [only earned $12,000 while working as a pornstar](https://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/mia-khalifa-says-she-has-earned-only-12000-in-her-brief-career-as-an-adult-film-actress-7155601.html) (in order to write about this subject, I'll have to reference a bunch of tabloids and anecdotes, please bear with me). Claiming to now earn [$10,000 per day from OnlyFans](https://www.ladbible.com/news/latest-mia-khalifa-making-far-more-money-on-onlyfans-than-in-porn-20220615). This development can't be certain of course, OnlyFans girls making enormous amounts of money in a short amount of time might be some type of celebrity scam, the equivalent of the son of a rich man claiming to have earned money as a drug dealer — to seem ""cool"" or ""close to the street"" (rather than admitting to having been born wealthy). And Mia Khalifa might be lying about her past to make herself seem more exploited. But if we take it at face value, what might follow?

&#x200B;

I know people frequently taunt OnlyFans' subscribers with phrases such as ""I can google 'boobs' for free"". But this seems to miss a few things. A lot of the subscribers to these sites, probably partially pay for the illusion of intimacy, chatting with Mia Khalifa's secretary who pretends to be her. A lot of them are likely also immensely picky, partially because generic porn is so easily accessible, leading to them having been desensitized. Once they've found a girl whose particularities ensure that simple nudes are enough to satisfy, then they're willing to pay for that. I'm not ""defending simps"", nor condemning them. That's a discussion for another time. My point is that when A.I image generations keeps getting better, and AI chatbots smarter, why keep paying for the ""real thing"" (to the degree any type of hyper-commercialized porn comes close to reality). Why not simply use an A.I girlfriend programmed to look like, and talk like, Mia Khalifa, in a few years? The app Replika has already been marketed as a fake partner that sends you NSFW pictures. As a buyer of labor, why wouldn't the coomer move on to other options?   


If a market crash for nude photos takes place within a few decades, or even years, which I find to be probable, then there are a few paths forward. People with luck, good planning, and the like, will have diversified their income in preparation. Invested in stock or made similar preparations. But some will be left with rents for big apartments and leases for luxury cars they can't pay, with no marketable skills that can transfer them into comparably high-earning jobs outside of ""sex work"". These people will either have to transition to a more modest lifestyle, or move onto ""full-service sex work"" (i.e literal prostitution). Leaving luxuries behind can be a lot harder for some people than one might think — an influencer cried publically about the threat of having to get ""a normal job"" when her [Instagram account was removed](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-6906411/Jessy-Taylor-cries-prospect-9-5-job-Instagram-deleted.html).  


The rise of OnlyFans is often claimed to have ""normalized sex work"", both by moralistic critics of it, and by people who cheer on that type of societal change as ""liberating"". Assuming they're right, will its downfall normalize ""full-service sex work""? Former sex-influencers selling intercourse, and writing about it publically due to traits of oversharing being overrepresented within the crowd using that site. In the old days, even some strippers would only be interviewed anonymously on TV — and pornstars hid their past instead of blogging about it, but a lot of OnlyFans stars don't seem shy.

&#x200B;

There are a couple of possible hindrances to this path toward further escalation and normalization. Perhaps there isn't a coomer audience to be found for prostitution, at least not one large enough, with deep enough pockets to finance 19-year-olds buying their own houses. Making the market less rewarding, and thereby less attractive. Perhaps the line needed to be crossed is simply stark for most OnlyFans stars. Either way, I suspect employment agencies will have to find a lot of burnt-out OnlyFans stars new jobs relatively soon.

Edit: the case of Mia Khalifa might be a bad example. MasterMacMan states that: ""Mia Khalifa became famous mostly after she was finished with her career. If she had produced work in the industry she would have gotten paid significantly more money.""

**The real material condition underlying right-wing populism isn't an increasing labor ***supply***, but a decreasing labor ***demand***, as capital flight/destruction reduce the availability of good jobs.** The fall of Soviet communism in the late 80s/early 90s opened Warsaw Pact countries (incl. the former East Germany) to foreign competition, whereupon their heavy industries withered away. The signing of NAFTA and formation of the WTO ca. 1995 likewise led to the final liquidation and offshoring of the already-hurting Rust Belt.

> This is a horribly idealist view - that we can only be truly free if we become a TOOLLESS race of super human savants with magical abilities. This goes completely against THE defining feature of our species: the use of tools. Yes we are reliant on them. Yes we will be even more reliant on them. **Yes the tools will get ever more complex. But I see no valid argument here for any inherent instability or corruption to such unfolding of events. Civilization is increasing complexity through more ubiquitous tool building. That's the paradigmatic foundation. Either deal with it or admit that the only true alternative ideal is reversing the big bang.** Because that is by definition the purest state that you'd want to strive towards.

As one may see this user got all theological, he went up to the Big Bang. Another user flaired rightoid claims,

> This has nothing to do with the political or social ideology that may pretend to guide the technological system. It is the fault of technology, because the system is guided not by ideology but by technical necessity.

What is disappointing is not only these inadequate, anti-socialist answers but that this sub or the left in general are generally clueless about this relationship. And this fosters complete nonsense views, yet this issue is right up the wheelhouse of the sub. This post is effort to cultivate a better understanding of technology and capitalism.

**A Classificatory Scheme**

A very simple scheme to distinguish views regarding of how technology relates to social relations (institutions/organizational forms) is to make two cases:

1) Technological changes precedes changes in social relations and are the cause of it. This view is by far the ever pervading view and is implicitly or explicitly held by a diverse a group of people like: Pop culture Marx, Engels, Plato, neo Classical economists, some historians of technology and many others. Presumably the hard headed historical and dialectical materialists in this sub with red flairs hold to this view.

2) Instead of calling this view social relation changes precedes or causes technological changes, I will instead call it the dialectical (or coevolutionary view), not only does technology change institutions but institutions or social relations change technology. They do so by increasing or decreasing the incentive for technology development and adoption which is in line with the institutions self preservation (or social reproduction). This view is held by The Real Karl Marx, Transaction costs economics (although they would not use word like dialectical), the great Harry Braverman and many people working in organizational economics.

I hold the second is the real Marxist view, with much greater historical explanatory power as compared to the ever falsely quoted and misunderstood view of base and superstructure which impotent Marxists keep on making, as the mod was making. The result of this impotence is playing straight into capitalist hands and celebrating a infantile form of accelerationism coddled with the false idea that “the bourgeois will sell the rope to the proletariat to hang them with.”

**Marx VS Engels: On technology and social relations**

Arguably the most sophisticated of Marx’s writing on techniques, once read, holds very much a view the opposite of 1. Marx declares in the Chapter 15 of Volume One,

> It would be possible to write quite a history of the inventions, made since 1830, for the sole purpose of supplying capital with weapons against the revolts of the working-class. At the head of these in importance, stands the self-acting mule, because it opened up a new epoch in the automatic system.

He quotes Andrew Ure as saying of the self acting mule

> A creation destined to restore order among the industrious classes.... **This invention confirms the great doctrine already propounded, that when capital enlists science into her service, the refractory hand of labour will always be taught docility.**

Marx explains the evolution of the replacement of the skilled worker by machine as such,

> The whole system of capitalist production is based on the fact that the workman sells his labour-power as a commodity. Division of labour specializes this labour-power, by reducing it to skill in handling a particular tool. So soon as the handling of this tool becomes the work of a machine, then, with the use-value, the exchange-value too, of the workman’s labour-power vanishes; the workman becomes unsaleable, like paper money thrown out of currency by legal enactment.

To summarize the workman enters the confines of the factory under the authority of capital where he is reduced to the work of few simple motions, under the command of capital after which the motions themselves are replaced by a machine. The workman is either superfluous or becomes a minder of the machine. Marx further explains the deskilling and homogenization process of the workers as,

> Along with the tool, the skill of the workman in handling it passes over to the machine. The capabilities of the tool are emancipated from the restraints that are inseparable from human labour-power. Thereby the technical foundation on which is based the division of labour in Manufacture, is swept away. Hence, in the place of the hierarchy of specialized workmen that characterizes manufacture, there steps, in the automatic factory, a tendency to equalize and reduce to one and the same level every kind of work that has to be done by the minders of the machines; in the place of the artificially produced differentiations of the detail workmen, step the natural differences of age and sex.

Marx supplies a barrage of example (later I will supply more and substantiate Marx’s claim) which illustrates his point, “no greater tragedy” than that of the English hand loom weaver and the Indian cotton weaver, “whose bones were bleaching the plains of India” vs the Power Loom, the carding machines, spindles, steam hammer, on the authority of Andrew Ure calico printing machines and machine dressing wraps.

To any one reading this section the view expounded here is plain. In society we have a situation of contradiction, people with opposite motives are fighting. The invention of machinery and the incorporation of it into the factory is used to teach docility to the laborer. Plainly the needs to preserve and reproduce the institutions of capitalism ( of which one is the control over the worker) new machinery is invented and adopted. See [Marx here](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm).

Contrasts this with the views of Engles of “On Authority”, endlessly cited by uneducated internet MLs and Maoists to quiet their uneducated Anarchists brethren. In retrospect when I look at the examples of Engles gives in On Authority they are exactly the examples given by bourgeois academics for the justification of capitalist authority in the 20th century. To the readers of Plato the example of the ship will not be new, the great doyen of American business history, Alfred Chandler, traced the emergence of Managerial capitalism to the organizational forms pioneered in the railroads in 1850-1870, similarly the Noble prize winning economist, Oliver Williamson tried to explain the presence of fiat within the firm by reference to transaction costs just like Engles did. I will answer this at end of this post. But before that a segway into war.

**War and the labour process**

It is common place in left wing circles to stress the importance of military technologies which later appear as spinoff in modern industry. Most posters of r/stupidpol know this, they even hold the view that is essentially a system of private profits and public subsidy. However I would like to emphasize a different aspect of war. If the technologies were indeed developed for war, where within armies a particular form of organization prevails, then what happens when spillover technologies is used for business? The answer is: the business operation themselves take on army like view.

No wonder Marx uses the metaphor of the army repeatedly in Capital. One cannot stress how important war has been in the development of modern technology and capitalism. Mining one of the first capital intensive development initially was boosted because of the need for metals in European wars. Similarly the first mass production of textiles was to supply European armies (Louis xiv) with uniforms. The so called American system of manufactures, ie prefabricated products with highly interchangeable parts and using capital intensive production, was first developed in the making of guns and army equipment during the war of 1812 and then the civil war. Except sadly for the Americans the Venetian public officials should have been given precedent.

The reason why this is being emphasized is this. Army production generally has three goals: i) uniform production ie general interchangeability ii) strict control iii) capital intensive methods. Each of this if used in civilian factories is a recipe against worker control. General uniformity means the management designs the product and worker can have no control over it, strict control means a complete clampdown of workers autonomy and high capital intensity means mass production with capital deepening and unskilled workers.

The further point is this army production is mass production. And most of it is waste production. Is it surprising that the methods of mass production which were developed in the army, the manager who was taught in the army and modes of organization pioneered in the army, will produce waste and environmental decay? And restriction of worker autonomy and control?

This entire discussion is based on Mumford’s [two volume](https://archive.org/details/mythofmachine00lewi) [history of technology](https://archive.org/details/mythofmachinepen00mumf). See also Chapters 1,2 and 8 of [this book](https://archive.org/details/militaryenterpri0000unse/page/n7/mode/2up), written by prominent historian of technology.

**The service of technic and the docility of man: Some examples**

**Solar Power vs Nuclear Power.** 

The first example I will illustrate is very societal and still has not come to pass, the appropriate trade off which i want to emphasize is very easily seen. Nuclear energy generation by it very definition requires the need for a “highly educated” technical class, a managerial class and for protection a military class, with guns and ammo and large capital outlay. The production of electricity must be concentrated in a particular geographical location. And again for matters of security the general public cannot enquire or go into the location of production unsanctioned. Communication and observation in this institution is one sided from a hierarchy to the general public. Consider likewise solar power, the production is decentralized, the capital is cheap a single individual can monitor the production and his individual use of the power. This individual can therefore practice self reliance nad does not need to depend on a state capitalist bureaucracy for his survival.

Can say the average customer of electric power facing a power cut when leaving for work in morning call up the Nuclear power plant and go, “What’s wrong? Could you guys do maintenance 10 minutes later, I really need to iron my clothes?” No the customer may never know who to call, or who is responsible? It will take a protracted public effort to stop power cuts, making this consumer reliant on a political bureaucracy. However suppose he had an individual solar panels on his roof or power was supplied from his housing community, then if indeed there was a power shortage, he could self determine his own usage or know where to inquire.

**Manorial Rights: The adoption of watermill against the handmill**

A persistent puzzle in the history of technology has to do with the following fact: the watermill atleast in the undershot variation, had been in existence since the 4th century BC, then why did it’s adoption throughout the western world take so long?

One answer is suggested by the historian Marc Bloch. He points out a major incentive problem, the watermill is a centralized machine, coinciding with the water source, therefore it is very easy for the feudal lord to monitor the total grain which is grained using the mill and therefore tax it appropriately. However, the handmill is mostly used at home in a decentralized manner the capacity to monitor total production is very low.

Therefore the peasants never wanted to adopt the watermill. Marc Bloch points out episodes in English history where the handmill of the peasants were seized or destroyed. When there was periodic peasant revolt the peasant reclaimed their hand mills.

This fits in perfectly with [Karl Wittfogel’s](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43643798) description of “oriental despotism” in civilization which used hydraulic power. Since the manipulation of river systems for irrigation and transportation required large centralized power those power system essentially became parasitic.

I will have to admit my discussion here is based of memory since I do not have access to [Bloch’s book](https://www.routledge.com/Land-and-Work-in-Mediaeval-Europe-Routledge-Revivals-Selected-Papers/Bloch/p/book/9781138856066#:~:text=Land and Work in Mediaeval Europe was first published in,original questions through his writing.).

**The self acting or automatic mule** 

The mule was invented by Samuel Crompton in 1779, it was hybrid between Hargreaves water frame (coarser yarn but strong) and Arkright’s spinning Jenny (finer yarns but delicate). Crompton a worker, who thought capitalist to be “speculative upstarts”wanted nothing to do with the factory system. The automatic mule was invented by Richard Roberts in 1825, which was put out through his company Sharp Roberts and Co. To understand the case of the automatic mule one has to look into the institutions of production between 1779 and 1825 and there off. 

The spinner was by far the most skilled operator in the production, he was actually a sub contractor who was paid by pound/length or pound/weight and he would pay his helpers, who could be his family members from this. When he was given a wage rate his relative weekly wages was almost thrice the other workers. The actual technical work which the spinner needed to do was very delicate, “he had to use the fuller shaft and wire so as to guide the yearn correctly into the copchase so that the correct cop size would form” similarly, “he had to turn the spindles with the fly so that the collected yearn refrained from slacking or breaking”.

The spinners however had a secondary preoccupation they were trade unionist. And they struck willy nilly since their work was a bottle neck in the firm this prevented the other workers from working. They also closely guarded the production of other spinners to prevent over supply and reduction in wages. This lead to a sharp contention between them and their bosses, since after the repeal of the combination acts in 1824, the spinners were creating a strong organization.

Therefore the bosses organized against them, the spinners actions were described as “an uncontrollable and despotic sway”, “domineering in the most arrogant manner” and “abusing their powers beyond endurance”, in this situation the bosses turned to Richard Roberts to help. Roberts himself and many others testified to this being the cause of his innovation. The automatic spinning mule was designed to be able to “accelerate the spindles to the speed of 5000 rounds per minute while still being able to precisely wind up the yearn without a surplus or deficiency” this problem was solved by Roberts using a “closed loop feedback control mechanism”. The consequence was mixed, although no factory was able to get rid of the spinners their effective capacity to strike and demand wage increases came to a stop. [An Example of correct cop formation.](https://imgur.com/ei6eJrB) [Robert’s closed loop feedback mechanism](https://imgur.com/ytZjlNv).

**Calico printing machines**

The traditional method for calico printing machine carried over to the 19th century was this, blocks of wood containing the etched pattern were created, the cloth or the muslin which was to be printed was submerged in the dye and placing the block over the cloth it was beaten with a hammer.

The workers were semi-skilled the industry was located at London and thereafter in Lancashire. Although the workers were not that hard to replace this was prevented because the printers had very powerful corporatist union. The union restricted entry into the trade (by not allowing journey men to have more than one apprentice), similarly it disciplined it’s members by issuing fines and collecting dues, it forbade masters from employing any journeymen who accepted below wages.

In England during this period the demand for calico printing was growing quickly, the union members restricted both quantities and quality of output, and entry to their field. As such the capitalists sought refuge in the hands of science. Copper cylinders were developed which were etched with design, the dye was applied on the design and clothes pulled through it.

The consequence of the machine is described in an 18th century pamphlet thus, “What has principally contributed to the increase of cylinder and surface machines, so that there are twenty now, where, fifteen years ago, there was only one? - Your turbulence. What has given birth to the union machine12 within these last eight years? - Your turbulence. What has produced, and is daily producing, all the varieties of two, and three, and four coloured cylinder and surface machines? - What but your turbulence? The machine makers say you are their best friends; and well they may, for they have been supported and encouraged by your proceedings” The your turbulence here refers to the union activities. See Bruland 1982

**Wool combing devices** 

The same example takes place in the wool industry in the 19th century. Before worsted wool can be spun it’s fibers are to spun in parallel directions. The comber would do this by, “two hand combs with two or three rows of teeth apiece, a stove at which to heat the combs, and a post on which to fix one of them. The work was hard and skilled”

Similarly their union was “formidable and ancient one, with aims and methods based (like the calico printers' combination) on aspects of guild organization. Throughout the eighteenth century they had a reputation for uncompromising militancy.” They were guilty of, “they gave laws to their masters, as also to themselves, viz.: - that no man should comb wool under two shillings per dozen; that no master should employ any comber that was not of their club, if he did they agreed one and all not to work for him; and if he employed twenty, they all of them turned out, and often times were not satisfied with that, but would abuse the honest man that would labour, and in a riotous manner beat him, break his combpots, and destroy his working tools; they further support one another, insomuch that they are become one society throughout the kingdom”

So their masters plotted against them with the service of science. “A volume would be required to describe in detail the numerous complicated contrivances for combing wool which, during the last sixty years, have been patented, some of which never came into practical use; and others again are only remembered as failures after short trials” wrote one commentator in 1857.

After multiple failed devices a particular device achieved much success, was invented by Cartwright. One commenter notes “Like the wool-combers of Norwich fifty years before, those of the West Riding were a turbulent ill-ordered class, and occasioned much trouble to their employers ...thus when Cartwright's combing machine became public, the manufacturers eagerly availed themselves of it, in order to dispense with the services of the hand-comber” THe consequence of this was at the end of the twentieth century combing became a low skilled operation of women. See. Bruland 1982.


**Numerical control vs Record Playback**

Are methods for automatic machine tool manufacturing. The machine tool industry which essentially supplies capital goods, until the 60s and even today is labour intensive industry which allowed for significant skilled work. Since they supply to capitalist of various sorts each order is different and is dependent on the machinists to make suitable adjustments. Small batch and low volume production. For example in the lathe a system of jigs and fixes could be set up by a skilled mechanic after which a less skilled individual may cut the metal. In the 50s with the relations to the manufacturing of Airplane parts the issue of automating machine tooling developed. Here there was two contenders.

Numerical Control was first conceived and developed by John Parsons (while working on Air Force AMC research and manufacturing center at Wright Field) and his contracted MIT engineers. While Record Playback was developed by General Electric, Gisholt and few smaller firms. R/P worked somewhat like this, the skilled machinist would set up the part and cut it, but a computer basically recorded his actions and then if the same part was to made again the computer could simply pass the instruction to the machine.

N/C works rather differently it separates the production into parts, shop floor tending and programming. Development of N/C therefore also had two parts, the easy part was to develop the actual machine which could translate instructions from the programmer and do the cutting and the difficult part was to develop a programming language which would allow programmers to code according to design specifications. So basically N/C machine cutting has three parts: i) The creation of an abstract mathematical representation for each part from engineering blueprint ii) For each such representation a code for the path of the cutting tool and iii) Feeding of the code to the machine and tending of the machine. i) and ii) are done by engineers while iii) is unskilled easily replaceable jobs. So in one felling scoop capital got rid of a large group of skilled labour.

But that is not all. As I previously mentioned the main difficulty was to create a programming language suitable enough to represent the complexity, this was very difficult. Finally Douglas Ross at MIT came up with Automatic Programmed Tools (APT), this allowed for programming of machining in 5 axises. Now although this is conceptually elegant, this is complete overkill for normal machining but not for aircraft industry. The Airforce after the invention of APT together with Aircraft association committee made APT the standard in all N/C system. This provided a tremendous entry barrier for machinists to learn and use the language. The story of R/P is even better, this invention actually accentuated the skilled worker for it got rid of tedious tasks. The invention was shelved once the original firm was bought out by Giddings and Lewis one of the major N/C producer. In every interview conducted of N/C developers and users they regardless of management or worker point that it is simply chosen because it wrestled control out of the workers hand.

**Tomatoes vs CTomatoes: The case of the tomato harvester**

Until now I have given examples of the capitalist need to control the labour process, avoid labour dispute and lower labour costs lead them to restructure the labour process, often with the benefit of a machine. Now it is time to give an example where the capitalist changes the product itself.

In 1964 the Bracero program which supplied cheap Mexican temporary workers for American firms came to an end. These labourers were exploited to the maximum, unpaid wages, lowered wages. However at the end of the program there was an acute worker shortage. [As this statistic of adoption of tomato harvester readily testifies it was in this situation the harvester was adopted](https://imgur.com/WHZKPqO). In about the early 60s there were a few varieties of the harvester, the most important of these were developed at UC Davis and then licensed to be sold by Blackwelder manufacturing company. But all of these harvesters faced a simple problem,

> “By the time the tomatoes were ripe enough for harvesting, some had fallen from the vines or did so at the first touch of the machine. If the machine cut the vines above ground level, the fallen tomatoes were lost. If cut at ground level, some were recovered. Cutting below ground level and picking up a thin layer of dirt saved nearly all of the tomatoes at the cost of having more dirt to separate from the fruit. The more dirt the machine picked up, the greater the possibility of contamination through a mixture of juice and earth adhering to the fruit.”

So what solution was developed for this?

> “The key to the success of the harvester lay in the breeding of varieties of tomatoes which could be handled by machine. This point was made again and again in early accounts. Later, in 1965, a Virginia economist stated that the tomato harvester was practical to use only under specific conditions. The yield should be thirty or more tons to the acre. The tomatoes should be resistant to bruising and nearly all should reach optimum maturity at the same time. Such conditions were so rare that complete or significant moves to mechanized harvest, other than in California was several years away.

So the solutions devised by the great technocracy was to change tomatoes themselves. Tomatoes which were developed were of pear shaped. GC Hanna who spear headed this development has said,

> “the greatest problem lies in overcoming the backyard garden philosophy of growing toma-toes. **For example, why should consumers insist upon a round tomato? Cylindrical tomatoes would be more efficient in a mechanical age.** Perhaps such tomatoes could be sliced and canned and thus win consumer acceptance.”

So if it eats into capitalists profits to pay workers a living wage, then the solution is to introduce mechanization and change the product themselves. And if the consumer demands actual tomatoes not “cylindrical tomatoes” then fuck consumer preference we live in the age of machines. A more satisfying example of capitalist reasoning and idealization of mechanization could never be witnessed.

See [Rasmussen 1968](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/894212/summary) [Friedland and Burton 1976](https://moscow.sci-hub.st/699/83ff9a350d155ad8dd418e18a45c48fd/friedland1976.pdf?download=true)

Each of the example I have given here is not exogenous technology developed by disinterested scientists causing technological unemployment. But this development of technology is endogenous, ie fostered by the capitalist to meet his own aims, adopted by his legal sanction. The aim is to further the real subjugation of labour and take away from the worker his own skills ie expropriate him.

**Humanity vs Machine and socialism**

I hope after reading the theory and examples which I discussed, the socialists and communists, should think twice before engaging in the synaptic exaltation of science and technology, they should think twice before saying that technology is neutral, they should stop saying, “gay space fully automated luxury communism” instead opt for human communism. 

Science is a human tool and a human activity and therefore suffers from the same bounds humans suffer. Humans pursuing definite aims (among them social aims) pursue science, science does not just happen. Similarly machine unlike a man does not go up to the capitalist and says, “Buy me! I cost 10$ but I raise production by 11$.” It is the capitalist who devices the machine gives it the legal sanction to be used in his shop.

Now we must confront with Engels problem and the issues he raised in “On Authority.” I propose to give a Marxist reply to Engels. Engels says,

> When I submitted arguments like these to the most rabid anti-authoritarians, the only answer they were able to give me was the following: Yes, that's true, but there it is not the case of authority which we confer on our delegates, but of a commission entrusted! These gentlemen think that when they have changed the names of things they have changed the things themselves. This is how these profound thinkers mock at the whole world.

Actually profound thinkers who Engels mocks, have a very important point. They shrewdly observed the difference between Real and Formal Authority. In a capitalist firm Formal Authority always belongs to the capitalist or an institutional equivalent. Because the ownership of means of production gives them the legal right to exclude any one from work and in principal the capacity to direct them at work. Now the capitalist may transfer such authority to the manager or the engineer, judging that they in certain circumstance may be better placed to make the decision. That is the case of real authority. But it is also the case the “tyranny of property” allows the capitalist to relieve such duties from the engineer and the manager, they may pay no heed to their advice, supersede their decisions and even fire them.

Now notice it is the “tyranny of property” which gives capitalist formal authority it is not because he is a SUPER scientist who has unified knowledge of the whole operation while the workers are drones who understand a part of the process.

> We have thus seen that, on the one hand, a certain authority, no matter how delegated, and, on the other hand, a certain subordination, are things which, independently of all social organisation, are imposed upon us together with the material conditions under which we produce and make products circulate. We have seen, besides, that the material conditions of production and circulation inevitably develop with large scale industry and large scale agriculture, and increasingly tend to enlarge the scope of this authority.

A more anti-Marxists tract has never been written. Engles says that the technology choice and therefore institutional choice is forced upon US. No, not one consumer or worker choose the automatic mule or the cylindrical calico machines or the wool combining machines, nor did they choose N/C over R/F, nor are they willing to consume cylindrical tomatoes on the contrary they protested against them and then they were crushed by the capitalist class. The only people who adopted the technology and on whose interest that technology was developed was the capitalists. That technology embodies the interests of the capitalists. Only by depoliticizing and reifying the techniques that Engels like Plato claims the naturalness of authority. Why does not he tell us about the development of the technology?

I have recently come to know Marx wanted Engles to write a history of War and Capitalism, Engles never got to doing so. If he had would have come to see the direct link now well developed by the Hitler supporting Marxist Wiener Sombart and later more profoundly by the historian of technology Lewis Mumford between mass production (large scale industry and large scale agriculture) and war. It is in war that these techniques (technology+social relations) were developed and later adopted to civilian life. Remember these techniques simply cannot function without certain hierarchical relations as Engels likes to point out.

However the reader may ask, what about the train? Should there be no trains in socialist society since it is undeniable that the train requires centralized authority. The answer to this is, sure the Trains can stay. But it will be only one part in the society’s transportation system. Society will also be availed of road, water and air transport. And there is no need to reorganize the production of cars, toys, machines and agriculture on the basis in which trains run or war is conducted. That can only happen if these decisions are put under democratic control. And if such decisions lowered the total amount of production, localized production, labour intensified production and gave worker control then we have double bonanza.

Again I am not an Anarchist, the purpose of the post is not to give Anarchists weapons against the MLs. Again my purpose is not to condemn all technology nor is to condemn capitalist technology, may be they can be used to human socialist cause. Correct theory and understanding requires experience and learning and accumulating past experience. Marx too sometimes spoke as technological determinist but when it came to his actual published work he laid all the stress on social relations. Lastly this post was highly influenced by two people (completely uneducated neither completed a Bachelors degree, yet their influence is enormous) Harry Braverman (author of Labour and Monopoly capital, the most important Marxist book published in the English language since Marx’s capital) and Lewis Mumford (the 20th century’s great historian of technic), so I wish to leave the reader with the following quotes by both of them about pertinent topics:

> “The demands for “workers’ participation” and “workers’ control,” from this point of view, fall far short of the Marxist vision. **The conception of a democracy in the workplace based simply upon the imposition of a formal structure of parliamentarism—election of directors, the making of production and other decisions by ballot, etc.—upon the existing organization of production is delusory. *Without the return of requisite technical knowledge to the mass of workers and the reshaping of the organization of labor—without, in a word, a new and truly collective mode of production*—balloting within factories and offices does not alter the fact that the workers remain as dependent as before upon “experts,” and can only choose among them, or vote for alternatives presented by them. Thus genuine workers’ control has as its prerequisite the demystifying of technology and the reorganization of the mode of production.** ………..It is a mistake to think, therefore, as some apparently do, that the raising of “the idea of workers’ control in industry—in the sense of an electoral structure within each workplace—is a demand that goes beyond Marxism. **Those who incline to this belief should note how Marx's entire discussion of the capitalist mode of production in the first volume of Capital is permeated by a much more revolutionary conception, which is the return of the process of production itself to the control of the workers in the fullest and most direct way.** Marx would have viewed a philosophy of “workers’ control” which made no mention of this kind of a revolution in the mode of production to be a feeble and illusory remedy, just as he would have considered a revolution, such as that in the Soviet Union, which altered property relations but left the mode of production untouched, as a hybrid form which, so long as it went no further, remained only the abortive first stage of revolution.

Harry Braverman, on actual Workers control, “return of the process of production to workers control” and “return of requisite technical knowledge to mass of workers”  stands in the face of Engels claim that regardless of the social organization certain technical hierarchies must prevail.

> Choice manifests itself in society in small increments and moment-to-moment decisions as well as in loud dramatic struggles, and he who does not see choice in the development of the machine merely betrays his incapacity to observe cumulative effects until they are bunched together so closely that they seem completely external and impersonal. What we call, in its final results, ""the machine"" was not . . . the passive by-product of technics itself, developing through small ingenuities and improvements and finally spreading over the entire field of social effort. On the contrary, the mechanical discipline and many of the primary inventions themselves were the result of deliberate effort to achieve a mechanical way of life: the motive in back of this was not technical efficiency but holiness, or power over other men. . . . Machines have extended these aims and provided a physical vehicle for their fulfillment.

298,nsepdv,2021-06-04,stupidpol,In Germany we call capitalists „Arbeitgeber“ (work-providers) and workers „Arbeitnehmer“ (work-receivers) which is so subtle yet manipulative.,"I was reminded of this when I read the latest bullshit about landlords wanting to be called „Housing providers“ instead. 

It’s such a simple but powerful trick. Basically using language to obscure that this is a completely imbalanced power relation, but this trend actually started in the 1890s. Huh I wonder why 



And then I found out that Engels actually commented on this in the 3rd edition preface to Das Kapital:

>	Thus not a single word was changed in this third edition without my firm conviction that the author would have altered it himself. It would never occur to me to introduce into “Das Kapital” the current jargon in which German economists are wont to express themselves — that gibberish in which, for instance, one who for cash has others give him their labour is called a labour-giver (Arbeitgeber) and one whose labour is taken away from him for wages is called a labour-taker (Arbeitnehmer). In French, too, the word “travail” is used in every-day life in the sense of “occupation.” But the French would rightly consider any economist crazy should he call the capitalist a donneur de travail (a labour-giver) or the worker a receveur de travail (a labour-taker).

——————
Edit: 

To clarify. The etymological origin of “labor-giver” and “labor-taker” is from late feudalist relations between a noble or wealthy family and their servants. The meaning was clear: The nobles graciously endow the peasants with a living. 

Starting in the 1850s, this language was adopted into laws that concerned the relation between capitalists and workers.
The mainstream use of these terms started in the 1890s. 

The problem is, as Engels stated, that it basically inverts the real social relation in capitalism. The “labor-giver” actually *takes* other people’s labor in exchange for cash. The “labor-taker” *gives* away his labor and its fruits to the “labor-giver”. 

I didn’t mean to imply that it’s a conscious conspiracy, but these terms were really helpful to the ruling class, because they have the implication that a) it’s a mutual give-and-take deal with no coercion or power imbalance and b) capitalists are framed as *endowing* the people with much needed jobs.",nebukadnezar_,t2_t1846,0.91,199,49

Women who, through whatever reason, become pregnant materially need to be able to sustain themselves and childbearing and rearing prevents that. Pregnancy temporarily disables women from working, as does childbirth, and because it “only” impacts 50% of the workforce, there are no laws that require paid maternity leave—as of now.

Average child support payments are about ~3500 a year. Not something 2 people can live off of.
 
Beyond bodily autonomy—no one can use my organs without my permission—and the impact this will have on privacy—is the government going to charge women for having “suspicious” miscarriages or even miscarriages that happen while working (heavy lifting, stress)—abortion has to be a labor issue.

Especially on social media, reddit including, you can go to any left wing socialist spaces and find little to no information regarding policy proposals, current events (outside of outrage mongering), or discussion of theory. It's all progressive activism and reactionary tantrums with zero substance. I just fail to see the connecting line between an industry co-opted by capitalist billionaires around a community of historically disenfranchised people now sitting in a position of highest privilege culturally is at all relevant to left wing ideology, or in any way conducive to the betterment of people's lives.

I can understand the historical context of LGBT activism aligning with left wing ideals as a means of fighting the evangelical right of the 20th century, but nowadays it really seems like nobody gives a shit about poor working class people completely left out to dry.

&#x200B;

 

Anyways, there is a bit of a fearmonger talking point that in which men are becoming\[and really people in general\] more obsolete and that the trend has kind of kicked off with the roots of the Industrial Revolution, so why is this a problem in regards to modern dating? Well, the more advancements keep on being made in regards to technology, science & infrastructure, the more is much harder for men to show-off any sense of not just honor, but **competence**, keyword here **competence.** Forget that men have an even stiffer dating competition compared to 10-20 years ago, men as whole are increasingly losing their ability to demonstrate **competence.** But remember, this is not a new sudden development, this started all with the Industrial Revolution, grocery stores and the rise of agrarian economies got so that people for once could afford food & groceries in comfort so that you didn't have to struggle through the fields to find guaranteed sources of food and nourishment, let alone consume them, however in the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, men still had a way to show for it and that was coming back from a factory, manufacturing site or power plant, this gave rise to the **production** economy. Manufacturing, oil/energy production & construction all became integral important jobs to society as these were the jobs responsible for advancing and pioneering our infrastructure system we got to see in play today. Without the early pressures of the Industrial Revolution, we would still be in dirt roads, we would still be living in cabins in the woods and we wouldn't the modern comforts we all enjoy and depend on including cars, cell phones, computers, appliances and furniture.

**So why am I bringing all of this of crap up and how does this affect men's prospects in the dating scene by any means?**

The move towards automation, as much as I hate to sound like I want us men to go back to our pre-Industrial roots and want us to only be able to do manual labor, is gonna make it harder for the average man to **brandish** himself, as in what will the average man have to show off for in the next 10 to 20 years?

Sure you have the rise of celebrity/influencer culture, but celebrities/influencers are part of the entertainment economy, they are not really an essential group of people to any given societal unit. No tribe back in the day would have cared about how much of an entertaining clown you were being

Most women are naturally attracted to men who got a lot of going for themselves, from an evolutionary and existential perspective it also makes complete sense, not just a social one. Back in the day if a woman got with a guy who was just kicking rocks, that meant the woman alongside him were doomed for extinction of the tribe, so yes to add in a little rationale, from a **survival & safety perspective** it made complete sense, a woman from a given tribe wanted the man who could hunt, who could make tools out of stone or wood, who could fish, who could go to war with other opposing tribes at the time, basically the jack of all trades or someone who was at least very specialized in something essential to the survival of the tribe while other men were also busy forging survival skills to survive in harsh conditions, because specialization didn't really become a thing until the emergence of the **information** **society.** Now you're starting to see the bigger picture?

So when young men are lacking in ways to display what they got to show off **competency & aptitude, why is society surprised men are getting a sense of feeling 'left behind'?** and remember, we live in an increasingly convenience and comfort-driven world, but the big irony that comes on top of that is the lazier society gets overall, the more the bottom %1 of laborers have to stress even more to maintain & circulate the infrastructure of society in order for it keep going, less and less people, particularly men, want to do labor-intensive & highly dangerous jobs, which causes the work conditions in these jobs to get even tighter and stiffer due to the lack of teamwork and collaborative efforts being made

This is why I encourage young men not to make relationships a top priority because otherwise the bad results will leave a bad mark, and cause utter resentment against women & society in general, Men need to learn the art of self-actualization, men need to learn to actually acquire skills that would come in handy in times like the Covid pandemic for example or in times of famine, disaster, civil unrest, like I mean conditions almost emulating the feel of what was like to live pre-industrial revolution days, but of course nobody is teaching young men any practical skills whatsoever, we're only teaching them to chase the bag, as if a shit ton of money is actually gonna help them in times of serious existential distress/stress, we should be teaching them tinkering and self-sufficiency skills, forget home improvement or working on cars, how many of us know how to grow our own food? How many of us know how to start a fire? How many of us know how to build a temporary shelter? See what I mean?

Anyways

**TLDR shortcut for the people who just want the straight-to-the-point explanation: Another one of the possible factors for modern dating's competition for men becoming stiffer and tighter is due to the lack of men's way to show off one's self, sure there is status toys like luxury cars and owning a shit ton of properties, but women are on average more attracted by competence than status as status is too temporary and ever-changing, where as competency looks more established and prepared to a person**",International-Pool29,t2_7srdssh6,0.79,107,148

It seems like when you're developing applications or website for users, there is this UX/UI elements which everyone is saying that it is important now - and having 'bad ux' is a bad thing, but UX to me seem to be comprised of two things, how to extract profits from users as much as possible, designing things so they gave you information for analytics, how to railroad them to big button to buy something, and the second is how to make everything closed off and uncustomisable, like making the programs/websites for children... Big bold buttons with little information to not overwhelm them, with flat cartoon characters to look friendly. Algorithms to show them ads and astroturfed content. Everything feel too streamlined and closed off. That engineering professors are saying that their students don't even know what directory is.

Everything on the internet looks the same now and there's not much space for creativity, because trying to do anything differently means users will have to learn. People said it's a 'good thing', because it means we have found a formula for ease of usage.

It's not just how everything is designed to be less functional and exploitative too. But it seems like now tech is running on the shorter and shorter cycles of bullshit trends. It was crypto a few years ago and now it is AI, and the long running trend of bullshit apps for everything like gamifying sleeping and drinking. While I think AI has a genuine use case, the way it get promoted now has to be some fuckery with VC money at the top. The field has lost its inventiveness. They just invent more way to make money with subscription services.

But to be fair, the general malaise is at eveything. House is getting less affordable, people are priced out of fulfilling life, and jobs are becoming more exploitative, medical industry is not about curing but more about creating lifelong patients, art and entertainment gets more streamlined and formulaic and any counterculture art is 'post ironic' detached memes and intentionally ugly things.

Interview is at 13:30.

I'm struggling to find the story online right now (might be an old interview) but it was a conversation with someone named Eisa Davis who wrote a play called ""Mushroom"". The play is about the lives of illegal immigrants in Pennsylvania who primarily work on mushroom farms in Kennet Square.

Throughout the interview she repeatedly talked about how terrible the working conditions are and how little they're paid. Rather than seeing this as an urgent cause for labor reform, Davis and the host simply kept reiterating why it's so important that we have these illegals who are willing to work in awful conditions for less-than-poverty wages with zero benefits and no job security.

She acknowledged that these workers aren't subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which would entitle them to better working conditions and wages. She talks about how dangerous and miserable the working conditions are -- long hours of back-breaking labor, often in hot/humid environments surrounded by dangerous and dilapidated farm equipment with littler or no oversight. She also mentioned how pervasive this type of labor is, saying ""If ICE did their job and deported all these laborers nobody would be able to eat!""

As a reasonable, non-sociopathic human being I kept thinking to myself *""Wow, this is appalling. It's just large-scale, modern-day slavery. These workers have no job security and no social safety net, they're being ruthlessly exploited because farmers know they have no way out. Surely they're going to talk about the fact that this brutal practice needs to be ended ASAP, not just for the sake of these immigrants but for the sake of all American laborers whose wages are suppressed by it.""*

But no, they just kept gushing about how beautiful their culture and stories are and how this type of labor is necessary so we can have cheap mushrooms to put on our filet mignon. It's like the workers aren't even human, they're just little ants inside a desktop ant farm that we can observe for our own entertainment. Oh, and as a bonus we get cheap food. Isn't it great!?

The craziest part is that I've discussed this topic with very liberal friends and family members and ***they all think this way***.

>A [recent survey](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/worker-institute/blog/reports-and-publications/first-its-kind-industry-report-shows-new-york-citys-app-based-delivery-workers-experience-harsh) of 500 delivery workers conducted by the Worker's Justice Project and Cornell University found that *more than half have had an accident or crash while doing a delivery*. *Three in four delivery workers said they paid for medical care from a work-related injury out of their own  pocket*. *Half said they have had their bikes stolen*.  
>  
>Now, during late night shifts, delivery workers cross bridges in large packs to ward off would-be thieves...

>Last year, Ajche fell after his bike wiped out on black ice and badly injured his knees. He notified the tech companies.  
>  
>""If you need assistance, we can call 911. But that's the best we can do for you. That's what they say to you,"" he recalled.  
>  
>That made him sad, he said, ""because you're working for them.**""**

The call for safety measures was met with only a slight aid from tech companies, which is somewhat commendable, but won't solve any problems.

>In  response to these growing safety concerns, DoorDash on Wednesday  announced a new tool on the app called SafeDash in six cities including  New York, in partnership with security company ADT. The app offers  ""reassurance calls"" if a DoorDasher feels unsafe and an easy way to contact 911 if a worker encounters danger.  
>  
>The company told  NPR if a worker suffers an injury while delivering for the company, they  may be eligible for accident insurance. But the protections do not  cover damage to bicycles and may not apply if a courier is delivering  food for multiple apps, which many do.

Whats interesting is that a lot of these guys probably don't have citizenship. They're unable to vote to change labor laws in their favor, many can only lobby others to do so.

>The  group successfully lobbied the New York City Council to set new pay minimums and require restaurants to let workers use their bathrooms,  which was previously not allowed.  
>  
>""OK, this is good,"" Ajache said of the new protections. ""But what about security? Security was the main problem on the street.""  
>  
>Ajche  wants better lighting installed on dark bridges and he wants the NYPD  to take crimes against delivery workers more seriously. He thinks there  should be a law to penalize perpetrators of crimes against app couriers.

These guys get at little as 14 bucks an hour depending on the day, in a dangerous job, with very little backing from their ""Employers"" and only slight help from the New York City Council.

>Ajche says his message to people ordering food through the apps is  this: Workers are often pulling 12, 13, 14 hour shifts for maybe $200 or $300 a night. They are moving, he said, as fast as they can.  
>  
>""They're  calling you, they're texting you, 'where is my food'?"" Ajche said. ""And  then sometimes it isn't the delivery worker's problem that the food is  getting to you cold,"" he said.

**Marx on Irish Immigrants in England**

>Quote from a letter Marx wrote to Sigfrid Meyer and August Vogt while in 1870. ""The English bourgeoises has also much more important interests in the present economy of Ireland . Owning to the constantly increasing concentration of leaseholds. Ireland constantly sends her own surplus to the English labor market , and thus forces down wages and lowers the material and moral position of the English Working class... And most Important of all! Every industrial and commercial center in England now posses a working class divided into two camps, English proletarians and Irish Proletarians.""

&#x200B;

>Marx believed Irish immigration was suppressing English wages and dividing the working class. So what was is solution? He believed an independent Ireland that would be free to develop without the constraints of the English Aristocracy over it, leading to having no need for emigration. Since the Independence of Ireland, the country has urbanized and developed leading to a decline of immigration to England, and a decline of anti-Irish antagonism among English working class and is not long a feature in England's politics. 

&#x200B;

**The First International and Immigration**

In 1866, faced with the by the employing class of Britain to import low wage labor Marx issued the following statement on behalf of the International.

>""Some time ago the London journeyman tailors formed a general association to against the London Master tailors, who are mostly big capitalists. It was a question of not only bringing wages into line with the increased prices of means of subsistence, but also but putting an end to the exceedingly harsh treatment of the workers in this branch of industry. The masters sought to frustrate this plan by recruiting journeyman tailors chiefly in Belgium, France, and Switzerland.

&#x200B;

>Thereupon the secretaries of this Central Council of the International Working Men's Association published in Belgian, French, and Swiss newspapers a warning which was a complete success. The London Masters maneuvered was foiled, they had to surrender and meet their workers' just demands.

&#x200B;

>Defeated in England, the masters are now trying to take counter-measures, starting in Scotland. The fact is that, as a result of the London events, they had to agree initially to a 15 percent wage rise in Edinburgh as well. But secretly they sent agents to Germany to recruit Journeymen tailors particularly in the Hanover ad Mecklenburg areas, for importation to Edinburgh. They first group already been shipped off  

&#x200B;

>If the Edinburgh masters succeeded, through the import of German labor, in nullifying the concessions they had already made, it would inevitably lead to repercussions in England. No one would suffer more than the German workers themselves, who constitute in Great Britain a larger number than the workers of all other Continental nations. And the newly imported workers, being completely helpless in a strange land, would soon sink to the level of pariahs. It is a point of honor with the German workers to proved to other countries that they, like their brothers in France, Belgium, and Switzerland, know how to defend common interests of their class will not become obedient mercenaries of capital in its struggle against labor.  

On behalf of the Central Council of the International Working Men's Association, 

Karl Marx  ""

Marx is stating the organized migration of labor is a strategy of capitalists against the workers. The obligation is on the foreign workers not to come if in so doing they would undercut wages and working conditions. You read that Karl Marx even threated German workers they would be treated as pariahs, essentially treated as enemies of unions among English labor.

&#x200B;

This an  example of how immigration has always been an ongoing problem of workers in capitalists countries, and isn't anything new today. Capital wants the freedom of movement of persons, services, and capital to maximize its profits. Examples today are the European court has repeatedly upheld the right of employers to move labor from one country to another to lower wages and circumvent collective bargaining agreements.

The EU court allowed Finnish shipowner, Viking, to reflag their ships in Estonia, to employ workers at lower rates from Estonia. In the Laval case, Latvian company imported workers into Sweden to build a school, undercutting Swedish rates. In both cases workers tried to go on strike, but the EU court declared the strikes illegal.

Marx said capitalisms has a double freedom to it, free to leave the land and sell their labor to urban capitalists. And free from land in the sense of being deprived of all ownership of the land. The term ""Open Borders"" is only a recent neo-liberal slogan, allowing free movement for employers to hire the cheapest labor. There is a saying in America that goes  many migrants do jobs Americans wont do, that is true but I think there should be  a second half to that saying. Migrants do jobs Americans wont do for those  wages and working conditions.

Manchin just shot down a bill that would've allowed those negotiations","[Manchin's daughter] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Bresch) was the former CEO of Mylar, the pharma company that got heat for hiking epipens prices 500% when they controlled 85% market share, to the extent that [they went to court for price fixing and had to settle for hundreds of millions.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-generics/exclusive-u-s-states-to-expand-generic-drug-price-fixing-suit-sources-idUSKBN1D0201) Less well known is that she was partially responsible for the government being unable to negotiate prescription drug prices.

> In 1992, Bresch started working as a clerk in a factory owned by Mylan, a generic drug company, and rose through the company to become the chief executive officer in 2012. At a WVU basketball game in 1992, Bresch's father, politician Joe Manchin, mentioned his daughter's job search to Mylan CEO Milan Puskar, and the company soon after offered her a position in the quality control department of a factory in Morgantown, before eventually promoting her to the executive level.

Manchin was a state senator in WV at this time.

> From 2002 to 2005, Bresch served as Mylan's director of government relations. She contributed to the development of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, which created Medicare Part D, a prescription-drug benefit.

[Schumer on BBB:] (https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-health-joe-manchin-congress-aff1136290d78abbfd7f4f7a9dc87c9e)

> Schumer said that for the first time, Medicare will be able to negotiate prescription drug prices in its Part B and Part D programs. The $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket costs would benefit those older Americans with the Part D prescription drug benefit, who numbered some 48 million, Democrats said.

More fun info on her:

> In 2006, Bresch testified before the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging to lobby for changes to the law that would prevent pharmaceutical companies from raising challenges to the introduction of generic competitors by filing citizen's petitions with the FDA, and that would prevent pharma companies from undercutting the profits of generic drug companies by making deals for authorized generics to be introduced.

**TL;DR**: Manchin got his daughter a job at a pharma company know for price gouging epipens. She is partially responsible for the government being unable to negotiate prescription drug prices under Medicare Part D, something that BBB would've changed had her father not just torpedoed the bill. In other words, Manchin's family and network stand to DIRECTLY financially benefit from BBB not passing.",OPDidntDeliver,t2_9db98,0.96,641,46

324,q0kv7l,2021-10-03,stupidpol,De-globalization and the tight labor market,"During the ""end of history"" from 1991-2008, the US gutted much of its already-battered industrial capital, choosing instead to inflate financial markets and use the proceeds to become the world's consumer of last resort. As this bubble burst, US net imports were [slashed in half](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=Hmhs) (as a percentage of GDP) and the [decline in manufacturing employment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=HlYF) ongoing since the 1970s was stopped. At the same time, the working-age population began to fall, thanks to the aging of boomers and reduction in immigration. Low post-recession birth rates in the US and abroad mean that further decline is baked in for another 20 years at least.

The shock of COVID-19 has only accelerated these trends, making the [American labor market](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=HlWz) exceptionally tight. As a percentage of those in the labor force/otherwise wanting to work, the rate of job openings is now 6.5% while the rate of unemployment is 8.5%; if current trends continue for another 6-12 months, job openings will exceed unemployment for the first time since records began in 2000. But as shown by the [experience of Japan](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F0cff9220-2fd4-11eb-a231-0fdc2eb46486-standard.png?dpr=2&fit=scale-down&quality=medium&source=next&width=700), a shrinking working population/reduction of immigration is no guarantee of higher wages, as it also leads to increased investment in automation and softening consumer demand even if [GDP per working-age person](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=HmmU) continues to rise.

327,v6z6m2,2022-06-07,stupidpol,The Australian Labor Party's First Clash with Capital,"Earlier in the week, newly elected Labor Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had the audacity to lodge a proposal to the Fair Work Commission to lift the minimum wage 5.1% (about $1/h), which would put it at a level above inflation. For context, Australian wage growth has been [declining since 2013](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b9cf1526550de936708e682127ff1849?src), and real wages are currently at the same level they were in 2011. While only 2% of Australian workers are on minimum wage, about 23% have their pay set by an industrial award, which would almost certainly see a commensurate increase with the minimum wage. Essentially, the newly elected Labor government are demanding real wages increase for a significant section of the workforce. 

Today, the Reserve Bank of Australia raised interest rates by 0.5%, double the standard movement of .25%, and significantly exceeding expectations. The justification? Inflation, driven by “the tight labour market contributing to the upward pressure on prices” (read: wages). 

[“Wage pressure in Australia, at 0.7 per cent over the March quarter, is still relatively subdued.
But with a tighter labour market, and **evidence businesses are basically passing on just about all higher costs onto customers, the fear is that a wage price spiral will ensue.**
""The RBA is clearly concerned that a tight labour market together with already high energy and commodity-driven consumer price inflation could lead to a lift in inflation expectations and a potential ""wage price spiral""](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-06-07/june-s-interest-rate-rise-and-what-it-means-for-you/101133174)

The Reserve Bank anticipate the lift in wages, and must move to counteract it. 

The commercial banks of course immediately pass on the interest rate to mortgage borrowers - an extra $200 a month for a standard mortgage of $500k. This is as the Australian consumer already faces the triple headwinds of eye-watering petrol prices, doubled electricity bills, and the threat of increased wage costs passed straight onto the consumer. To make matters worse, experts are tipping them to do the same thing next month, with forecasts of an official interest of 2.5% (0.85% currently) by next year, which would add another $625 a month to the $500k mortgage repayment. 

According to Australia's premier financial news outlet, the proposal to lift wages in a time of inflation has dire consequences for the Australian worker. 

[If there are large wage rises across the board of say, 4 per cent to 5 per cent, there are only two ways to get inflation down towards the RBA’s 2 per cent to 3 per cent target band.
**The first and preferred option is for most workers to begrudgingly accept a short-term cut to their real wage.**
Nominal wage rises of up to about 3.5 per cent are sustainable, assuming productivity growth of about 1 per cent.
**The second and worse option is for higher unemployment to tamp down wages and inflation.**
While the labour market is strong, over the medium term, job losses for some of the 13.4 million employed Australians would be a tragic price to pay to tame inflation.](https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/rba-s-super-sized-rate-rise-comes-with-a-wage-warning-20220607-p5arnv)

**In a time of blow-out inflation and mortgage pressures, workers either accept lower wages or face job losses. And why? Because it’s completely out of the question that businesses would have to eat higher costs.** 

[Australian corporate profits rose 10.2% last quarter, seasonally adjusted. Wages rose 1.8%.](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/business-indicators/business-indicators-australia/latest-release)
In fact, Australian corporate profits have never been as high as they’ve been since the pandemic. Something is rotten. How do we accept an economic system where shareholder rate of return is sacrosanct, and the average worker has to sink or swim? 

Labor have been set up to fail. They're already pushing uphill wrt their economic credentials: in the eyes of the Australian voter, Labor are fiscally irresponsible, and their profligacy inevitably leads to higher taxes. The neoliberal Coalition significantly outperform in economic perceptions. Not only are Labor's election spending promises are already in the crosshairs, with fears they'll drive up inflation further, but [media pundits are calling for ""budget repair""](https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/the-size-of-the-rba-rate-rise-probably-didn-t-surprise-treasury-20220607-p5arqd), with higher interest rates increasing the cost of servicing the debt. **Labor are wedged between their core commitment of raising wages and government spending, and being tarred as the ones who drove up cost of living and job losses.**",TotalEnmity,t2_5wmfx,0.97,30,24
328,vwt1na,2022-07-11,stupidpol,[longpost][effort] The US education system is on the brink of total collapse and we're all completely screwed.,"I've been keeping up with what's going on in education because \~children are the future~ and holy shit, we're in deep trouble. The system is currently being assaulted from multiple angles, and while COVID is a major factor in its dysfunction, it's really more of an accelerant for trends that have been ongoing for years. Here's a completely unscientific and non-comprehensive breakdown of why our future generations are going to be non-functional:

#**The Society**

We all know how little trust US culture has in education, so no point in spilling more pixels on it

#**The Parents**  
This section is going to be mostly anecdotal because crawling through parenting publications makes my eyes bleed, but I've been watching this shit go on for years so whatever. Even beyond factors like SES and family structure (for the sake of brevity I won't get into factors largely beyond parents' control), there's a vast body of evidence pointing to the fact that how parents parent has a large effect on what their children turn into. Research consistently demonstrates that children of parents with authoritative [parenting styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting_styles) [have the best outcomes](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407520960818), [including in academic achievement](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10834-015-9444-5), while children of parents with permissive and neglectful parenting styles consistently underperform. It is perhaps these parents that demonstrate the  [involvement and high expectations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1747938X18301027) in their children's education that are also linked to success. 

Ok here's where it gets anecdotal. In my completely unscientific observation, parenting trends have shifted to become extremely permissive (see: [attachment parenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_parenting) which gets completely fucking bonkers once you scratch past the surface). Although it's good that it's no longer acceptable to beat children, it seems to have become normal for parents to attempt to shy away from even mild forms of discipline and thus fail to correct problematic behaviors. Without authoritative (even authoritarian would be better) parents providing their children with structure through a system that mixes reward to enforce good behavior and punishment to extinguish bad behavior, they'll be ill-equipped for the classroom.

But there's something even more pernicious happening than granola parenting- parents are exposing their children to long periods of screen time from a very early age. This poses a serious, serious problem; in [early childhood](https://academic.oup.com/pch/article/11/9/571/2648303?login=true), people's brains rapidly adapt to the environment they're being brought up into -- for example, aboriginal australians develop very strong spatial cognition to survive terrain with few landmarks. Parents who give their children regular access to youtube kids and tiktok are literally, unironically giving their brains permission to permanently adapt to a world of rapidly-changing, oversaturated, narrative-free stimuli. Even the most structured parenting can't overcome that.

#**The School Boards**    
School board positions across the country are typically filled with elected or politician-appointed members that pander to what voters or politicians want in order to obtain and keep their jobs. Despite the fact that BOE appointees don't have to have any understanding of how education works, they hold immense power over the school districts they oversee. Like publicly-traded companies, school boards show their stakeholders (voters) that they're successful through quantitative metrics like operation costs and graduation rates, which, like publicly-traded companies, often leads them to do things to boost these short-term metrics at the expense of meaningful long-term goals. Examples of common and extremely destructive policies commonly put into place to cook the books are 'avoid Fs at all costs' (i.e. shuffling kids along until they graduate barely literate), 'avoid suspensions or expulsions at all costs' (more warm bodies = more funding), and 'create an inclusive environment' (i.e. eliminate SPED resources to save money). 

Of course, they are also increasingly expected to achieve ideological wins that at best do nothing to improve education quality. With education having become ground zero for COVID and culture wars, the true value of schooling to many voters and BOEs across the country (a low-cost babysitting service that hands out good grades and diplomas and doesn't teach anything that challenges what area parents are trying to indoctrinate their kids into) has been laid bare.  

# **The Administrators**

Over the past couple decades, the education system has shifted into a 'the customer is always right' service model. As with school boards, admins are concerned with boosting their quant metrics so that their schools appear to be 'good'. Their preoccupation with numbers like graduation rates, in addition to their fear of angry parents, has made behaviors like [grade inflation](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED598893), [shuffling unprepared kids through the system](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-functionally-illiterate-students-allowed-to-graduate-from-high-school) instead of holding them back until they learn the material (which makes catching up increasingly harder to the point where we end up with high schoolers ([and college students](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/12/16/graduated-not-literate)) who are [functionally illiterate](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2020/10/27/reading-level-math-test-scores-high-school-seniors/3746305001/)) and [refusing to discipline](https://www.live5news.com/2022/01/07/charleston-county-school-district-sued-over-workplace-safety/) disruptive students (who [hinder learning outcomes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775715000059) for the rest of the class).   

Like fresh-faced middle-managers, school administrators are often on the look-out for feel-good trends they can adopt (or pay lip-service to) to demonstrate to parents and teachers that their schools are on the bleeding edge of developments in education theory -- but without making tough, expensive, or unpopular changes that might actually improve student outcomes. In fact, the ways in which these concepts are implemented tend to conveniently cut costs (e.g. special ed staff) or improve metrics (e.g. disciplinary actions) while passing additional burden onto the teachers and tanking education quality for students. A historical example that is now deeply-entrenched within education systems internationally is [mainstreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstreaming_\(education\)), which likely [harms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775721000406) [student performance](https://www.eui.eu/Documents/DepartmentsCentres/Economics/Seminarsevents/Balestra.pdf). A more recent example is [restorative justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice); [extremely hard to implement correctly in the classroom](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-019-01013-2), these programs often amount to admins [allowing students to engage in disruptive or even violent behavior consequence-free](https://isthmus.com/news/cover-story/rotten-year/), with nary a hint of 'restoration' or 'justice' involved.

The burden of executing administrative and school board vision lies almost entirely on the backs of teachers. Faced with feral kids who are often so far behind that they're literally incapable of understanding class material, a directive to prevent kids from failing at all costs, and [job](https://core.ac.uk/reader/345094950) [creep](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/213926/1/2021_EI_Research_StatusOfTeachers_ENG_FINAL.pdf), the role of the teacher shifts from teaching to meeting the ever-changing whims of parents and superiors. But at least administrators ~~force them to suffer through team building exercise-tier bullshit~~ generously invest in their future through [professional development](https://hechingerreport.org/new-report-reveals-that-teacher-professional-development-is-costly-and-ineffective/)!

#**The Teachers**

Faced with disrespectful and even hostile parents, unsupportive admins, stingy and politically-motivated school boards, and hellraising students, teaching is no longer a viable career path. Contrary to the common wisdom that 'those who can't do, teach', a high proportion of teachers -- particularly highly-needed specialists -- enter the field from [other backgrounds](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-teacher-shortage-is-real-large-and-growing-and-worse-than-we-thought-the-first-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/) because they want to help our youngest citizens thrive. If teachers can no longer teach, the profession is treated with disrespect, and licensing requirements (particularly for those much-needed specialists) are [extremely time-consuming and costly](https://www.alleducationschools.com/teacher-certification/)...who's going to want to be a teacher?

You may have noticed that most of the links in this longpost are pre-pandemic. Even back then, [attrition rates and teacher shortages](https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/) were so high that schools in some areas [were hiring teachers from the Philippines](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/schools-in-illinois-florida-arizona-and-colorado-hiring-teachers-from-philippines-to-fight-staff-shortages) to fill in the gaps. With COVID and culture war bullshit to contend with, teachers are now [starting to quit and retire en masse](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/04/teachers-quitting-jobs-covid-record-numbers), and teaching program enrollment [has declined](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/10/28/teacher-education-programs-continue-suffer-death-thousand-cuts) to the point where those positions can't conceivably be filled.

#The kids

They're reportedly quite often little shits who are incapable of engaging in activities that require critical thinking, creative thinking, or attention, but given how much adults are failing them, who's to blame?

#**Predictions for the future**

The deterioration of the public education system (+ parenting) is quite possibly one of the biggest risks to the future of the country. Some predictions for the next decade and beyond:

* **Upward class mobility will be next to impossible for US natives**: Children who aren't placed in high-quality private schools won't have the skills necessary to obtain a college degree. The secondary education system may be faced with relaxing its standards to shuffle people through (which has been happening, albeit at a much slower pace than K-12), thus further devaluing US bachelor's degrees and leading companies that can afford to be discriminating to require more proof of skill (i.e. low- and unpaid internships) before investing in young workers.
* **More immigration will be necessary to maintain economic output in key sectors**: Because we won't produce enough skilled workers ourselves, we'll need to import more skilled workers from developing countries to work in sectors that require both a degree and talent.
* **Young adults won't be able to engage in critical thinking or reading**: This is already a problem that the country faces due to poor-quality parenting and poor liberal arts education, but it'll intensify, which has implications not only for how they think about politics but things like susceptibility to scams.
* **Young adults won't be equipped with the ability to engage in long-term planning**: The aforementioned poor-quality parenting and poor liberal arts education will leave young adults unequipped with long-term planning skills and the ability to delay gratification, leading to an increasing adoption of exploitative gig work and financial illiteracy. This is already happening among zoomers
* **A vicious gutting cycle**: As is the case with other social programs, the deterioration of the public education system will provide conservatives with justification to further destroy the system because why invest in it if it's not working? This is likely part of the strategy for some of the recent state attempts to relax qualification standards.",snallygaster,t2_4vggm,0.95,751,335

A few factors of the job have made me more conservative while some have made me more socialistic. Arguably more important are the parts that have policies where I can obviously see exploitation but is in my financial interest to perpetuate anyway.

1. Tipped workers (who make $2.13 an hour in my state) often make significantly more than they normally would hourly. A lot of workers would rather make slave wages + tips than a reasonable base wage. 

2. Bloated management: we for a time had twice as many managers as we needed because we were given permission to ignore budgets (we were being sold). Lead to extreme inefficiency because staff wanted promotions and managers wanted to work less. Within 6 months of being bought we went from 14 managers (7 salary, 7 hourly) to 8 (4 salary, 4 hourly) and were still able to get 90% of the same work done

3. Corona shutdown: literally 75% of the people i know are out of work right now. A lot are desperate to go back to work even with the danger because they're *that worried* about running out of money (govt services in my state are abysmal). Also any company not open right now is because they couldn't profit, moral opposition to reopening is a non-factor.

4. Healthcare: Only about 10% of the staff qualifies for employer based insurance. Many of those opt out due to how expensive it is. A lot of our staff is young and still on their parents insurance or just don't have insurance at all.

5. Hours: Certain parts of the staff will fight over getting to work as much possible (especially OT) because they need the money. We have college students that would work 50+ hours a week if we let them, because they just need the money that bad. The issue of cutting people to the point employees are overworked so that we can afford to stay open is also a big factor. We often have to choose between miserable work or no work at all.

341,13wztc3,2023-05-31,stupidpol,"On parenting and the ""traditional"" family with an equitable distribution of labor","A big thanks to u/Oncefa2 for his [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/13w0k01/the_largest_threat_to_traditional_family_values/) on bringing up the topic of the ""traditional"" family on this sub, with this post being somewhat of an indirect response to that thread and some of the posters there, particularly on the general idea of a zero sum game of the ""breadwinner"" and ""homemaker"", mainly the idea that having one parent stay at home and one work a 40(+?) hour day is the most efficient or preferable way to raise children, and while I 100% support monogamy, I can't help but feel like this view tends to essentially put the onus of responsibility for childcare almost exclusively on the mother while simultaneously (even if subconsciously) devaluing the caretaking and nurturing role of the father.

Humans are interesting when compare to other members of our taxon in that we are relatively (by the standards of other great apes)...pretty neglectful parents (which ironically enough is not inherently a bad thing, as children past a certain age do require a degree of benign neglect, as children are raised by their parents, their peers and greater community and by themselves, all at the same time), in other great apes the mothers spend a great amount of time focusing their attention on raising their infants into maturity, with orangutans for example, with babies being carried and breastfeeding from their mothers for nearly seven years. In most other apes, the onus of childcare is put on the mother to exclusively raise their offspring, while in contrast, humans developed monogamy to take some of the load off of childrearing on the mother, and maximize their children's likelihood of survival into adulthood.

By extension of humans being a relatively neglectful species of parenting, the modern father in post-industrialized societies represents a much more neglectful father than in many hunter-gatherer societies. Taking the Aka/Biaka foragers of Central Africa for example:

> Fathers of the Aka tribe spend more time in close contact to their babies than in any other known society. Aka fathers have their infant within arms' reach 47% of the time[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aka_people#cite_note-7) and make physical contact with them five times as often per day as fathers in some other societies.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aka_people#cite_note-hewlett-5) The men also help the women, by feeding their children. It is believed that this is related to the strong bond between Aka husband and wife. Throughout the day, couples share hunting, food preparation, and social and leisure activities. 

So I think while I acknowledge that dual income households where both parents work 40+ hours while they're kids are stuck in daycare is a tragedy, I'm not sure it's an inherently ""better"" to have a man work 40+, essentially neglecting the care of his children, while the mother has a disproportionally and unhealthy burden of essentially single handedly raising a child. Ironically, a more efficient system for raising children would be (in a purely, let's say under ""utopian"" socio-economic conditions) would be to have an economy that allowed both parents to switch between the roles of homemaker and breadwinner, with each parent only working 20 hours a week, equalizing the participation in childrearing, with the extended family/clan and family friend (which could technically also be considered a part of the extended family in this context) to also assist in raising their children.

Of course this is just a spitball concept I thought of in like 20 seconds, drawing from the cursory knowledge I have of modern hunter gatherer cultures (which cannot be used as a window into our Paleolithic ancestors, but can be useful in understanding their lifestyle dynamics), but I notice a willfully distinct lack of creativity in thinking about how you would actually solve these problems without copy and pasting questionably ""successful"" lifestyles in raising (at least relatively) healthy children, without essentially putting the entire burden of childrearing on the mother (which is part of the reason we evolved monogamy in the first place), and also essentially making the father an equal parent to the mother.",ScipioMoroder,t2_40tgoop0,0.84,26,22
342,wlu68v,2022-08-11,stupidpol,"Some thoughts on society, theory, and the working class","I. Organicism and the situation today

The key epistemological problem that threatens to reduce all of our theorizing to rubble is that of the identity of essence and appearance, or of being-in-itself and being-for-us. Kant has given the duality its characteristic modern form, but it is Hegel who has most relentlessly pursued the identity through the labyrinth of phenomenal experience. While Hegel's philosophy is well known and frequently enough cited, he is one of those thinkers whose insights have generally succumbed to the disintegrating effects of deflationary metaphorization and synthetic eclecticism.

Hegel's solution to the dualism mentioned above is a robust organicism in which all differences circle back round to an ultimate, absolute identity. This organicism furnishes rational necessity, unites being-for-other with being-for-self, and ultimately situates various modes of being (such as the mechanical, chemical, psychological, and social-spiritual) within a common frame of reference. In short, it resolves the basic problematic that defines philosophy, the relation of thought to being, and all subsidiary philosophical problems, and establishes the necessity of a super-individual subject, an I that is We, called Spirit.

Unfortunately, it is no longer ""hip"" to *resolve* problems; the thing to do, now, is to problematize, to poeticize, to self-consciously peddle bullshit and declare ""that the satisfaction of finding is a sheer impossibility"". This is only the further development of a situation with which Marx was most familiar:

""Later when the German market was glutted, and the commodity in spite of all efforts found no response in the world market, the business was spoiled in the usual German manner by fabricated and fictitious production, deterioration in quality, adulteration of the raw materials, falsification of labels, fictitious purchases, bill-jobbing and a credit system devoid of any real basis. The competition turned into a bitter struggle, which is now being extolled and interpreted to us as a revolution of world significance, the begetter of the most prodigious results and achievements.""

What better description do we need of postmodernism and the whole situation today in theory? The deflationists and eclectics tell us: ""oh, it may *sound* as if Hegel is trying to resolve problems, but really he is much too smart to believe he could do any such thing"". At the same time, we are told that Freud did not *really* mean ""incest"" (how horrid that would be, let's not even think of it) and had very little to say about *actual* family relations; that Marx was not *really* about Leninist revolution at all, that despite their 40 years of friendship and collaboration, Engels falsified the views of the good liberal Marx who, it turns out, stood exactly for the values of the declining finance capitalist of our 21st century. The most daring of these interpreters goes so far as to claim with a serious look on his face that, in spite of everything he said, Marx really meant the *opposite* of it all, that if we want to understand Marx, we simply need to tell Marx what it is that we think he should have said. In any case, Althusser, like the rest of them, opens up a space to pursue his own career, to peddle his wares and to inject further, unnecessary confusion into an already intolerably muddled situation.

If Hegel's organicism demands that all differences route back round to identity, that all disagreements seek reconciliation, then the tendency of which we are speaking here must be regarded as a kind of blockage in the functioning of the social organism. A difference that goes its own way, that turns its back on the whole organism is, in fact, nothing else than what we call ""cancer"". Hegel, like Marx, was familiar with the issue, which he described as the ""spiritual animal kingdom"" in which the Sache selbst, the heart of the matter (the healthy functioning of the social organism) was mistaken for something individual, a situation of rampant careerism and individualism resulting from the standpoint of civil society in which private interests predominate.

II. Ontology and Epistemology on the Production Floor

A relative who is a nurse was recently called in to assist in delivering a baby in an emergency situation, being deployed along with other finite resources in order to perform her duty and realize all of her training. When she arrived on the scene ready to devote her full attention to the patient, she was immediately turned away. No, the baby was not dead; neither was the mother (it is not that kind of story)—in fact, there *was* no mother. The patient had a penis.

Psych issues happen. The infrastructure we have to deal with them is simply inadequate, and capitalism will never be otherwise. Nonetheless, there is a deeper issue here. The professionals on the scene could not even explain to this man *that he is a man*. Not because he wouldn't listen, but because their own careers would be suddenly in jeopardy if they did try to explain the facts to him.

I would like to contrast this with a situation I've observed as an industrial worker. A trans ""man"" once got employed in the factory where I worked, a woman who wore a binder, used male pronouns, and changed in the men's locker room. Nobody told her that she wasn't man; in fact, nobody talked to her at all—nobody had to. It became abundantly clear that we weren't going to play her game, that if she wanted to be recognized or to have any presence in our social body whatsoever then she would have to recognize reality and quit playing games, or else rationally persuade us that she belonged in the men's locker room. She quit soon after.

In a factory, all of the workers together form one body. The production process is not realized by any individual but by all of the workers together, and it constitutes an organism; in fact, it constitutes exactly the social, human organism in its metabolic relation with nature, an I that is We, a living being of which individual workers are organs. While it is not necessary for individual workers to agree on everything (in fact, disagreement has an important function; the proliferation of differences is as necessary as the return to identity in the process of life), there *does* need to be a basic commitment to a shared frame of reference, to a shared reality, to the life of the whole. In the best case scenario, she would have worked with us and kept her gender issues in her back pocket to deal with when she got home; the fact that she quit shows she would have been content with nothing less than the rest of us entertaining her delusions.

There are three epistemological dimensions to industrial labor: one is the practical, active relationship to material reality, the fact that you take the earth in your hands and direct it to some end. The tools and materials that are used cannot be imagined as ""social constructs"", because they are simply not fungible; they have discrete, objective identities determined by their functions. The second is the social, collaborative nature of the labor; we all refer to a shared world in universal terms in order to continue to work; we are all together in an intersubjective situation. The third is the ""some end"" referred to in the first dimension, which it turns out is the reproduction of the whole society: the work we do in the factory is the embryo from which everything else develops, the root and ground of the whole social, intersubjective world (and even our knowledge of the natural-scientific world, since science and industry are inseparable in the last analysis), its essence.

III. Accountability 

It is common to see academics complaining about the job market, about the difficulty of being accepted into a PhD program or of getting a professorship. What is not so common is to see any explanation of why they *should* get these jobs or what they have to offer the society whose resources they exhaust as they are paid to think. Just as the proletariat is relatively immiserated in terms of wealth, working more to get less of what we produce, so we find theory becoming less and less accessible and less accountable to those of us whose labor makes it possible in the first place.

There are three intersecting issues here: (a) the proliferation of frameworks, problematics and ideas that resist unification and reproduce tired concepts under new names in the service of careerism and individualism/subjectivism; (b) the growing distance between those of us who work and the knowledge that by all right belongs to us; and (c) the yawning gap between the most rarefied ideas or philosophies and the practical, metabolic relation with nature that is their ultimate ground, this gap between discourse and reality, between words and things—no wonder these people think it is social constructs all the way down!

Ultimately, there is no solution to this problem under capitalism; that is a given. *However*, the simple unconcern with which these theorists continue to spin their theories without ever deigning to come back to earth and to explain their ideas to the rest of us (and even thereby to justify them for their own sakes!) is frankly bewildering. I am not advocating a cultural revolution, and there is enough cancel culture bullshit in the world already. What I am demanding, in fact, is the opposite: not no-platforming and silencing people, but some kind of intellectual engagement, some recognition and a basic, good-faith attempt to connect theories back to the practical world they ought to describe.

What makes somebody think that they have an unquestionable *right* to a professorship while other people perform manual labor to keep the world turning? Somebody has to put food in people's mouths and clothes on their backs, and many of us are proud to step in and to do that, but what is impossible for many of us to understand is the pure self-interest with which people insert themselves into an ivory tower and spin theories apparently for nobody's benefit but their own, apparently with no concern whatsoever for society, for those of us who work to make their philosophizing possible. 

Today, there are increasing fights on the cultural front between the ""critical race theorists"" and workers, between those who want to let men in women's bathrooms and concerned parents, between the social constructionists and those of us who still believe in an objective reality. Frequently, those of us on the side of the workers are made to feel naive, inadequate, intellectually lazy, or just plain old stupid for failing to appreciate ideas that are simply never defended or explained.

To conclude, I'd just like to point out that the situation I've described in the last paragraph is not sustainable. Eventually, something must break. I do not promote violence, certainly not terrorism or anything like that, but I do recognize that it is somewhere on the horizon. As was said earlier, there will always be psych issues, there will always be somebody who is ready to snap. Perhaps it cannot be avoided entirely, but it can be minimized. Why these intellectuals and petty bourgeois snobs are not even interested in minimizing it by establishing mutual understanding and discourse is difficult to comprehend. They will be the first to claim that ""riots are the language of the unheard"", but apparently they are not interested in hearing or in speaking to those of us who do not belong to their high society, whose thirst for knowledge and culture is frustrated by those who monopolize it and whose actual, practical experience—the ground and essence of the whole social ensemble, of human existence as such—is not taken into account or engaged with in their conceptions of reality.",744464,t2_fsjiqt64,0.64,29,93

I am originally from the rural part of a southern US state. I didn’t grow up desperate, I had a pretty normal middle class life provided by my father who worked very hard to provide that by trading away large amounts of his time at the factory he worked at. My parents never pushed me to go to some Ivy League college, or to become some prat at a firm somewhere. That isn’t their world as for most people in the place I originate. I managed to find my way into an office job on my own after going to university as we were told relentlessly in the 90s and 2000s to go do. 

I did manage to pull off the plot the people pushing that message had in mind. I got the job. But now what?

I am curious how any other office cogs here feel about their jobs and how you think it relates to certain Marxist principles like alienation. I feel like I have a front row seat to just how insanely batshit the US economy really is. This job along with so many of the people I work for is highly performative. The job is basically employment insurance for middle management to keep their jobs by using my coworkers and I work to impress their superiors, but very little ever comes of it.

It’s basically a process of putting together large amounts of work, showing it off, getting gratitude, and then rinsing and repeating. No one of course in my work is willing to admit this is what we actually do. It’s mostly theater.

Obviously I know of David Grabers book, but I think Mark Fisher also makes interesting points that relate to this, that work is only useful in capitalism as far as it matters on a PR basis. True productivity is not required, only the performance of it, because everyone is running the same grift and no one wants to screw themselves over by talking about it.

So much of the US white collar sector is a house of cards propped up by people who just need a job. But because of that they are forced to do incredibly boring, alienating, and down right anti human experience work.

>The Army's recruiting of white soldiers has dropped significantly in the last half decade, according to internal data reviewed by Military.com, a decline that accounts for much of the service's historic recruitment slump that has become the subject of increasing concern for Army leadership and Capitol Hill.

>...

>A total of 44,042 new Army recruits were categorized by the service as white in 2018, but that number has fallen consistently each year to a low of 25,070 in 2023, with a 6% dip from 2022 to 2023 being the most significant drop. No other demographic group has seen such a precipitous decline, though there have been ups and downs from year to year.

>In 2018, 56.4% of new recruits were categorized as white. In 2023, that number had fallen to 44%. During that same five-year period, Black recruits have gone from 20% to 24% of the pool, and Hispanic recruits have risen from 17% to 24%, with both groups seeing largely flat recruiting totals but increasing as a percentage of incoming soldiers as white recruiting has fallen.

>The rate at which white recruitment has fallen far outpaces nationwide demographic shifts, data experts and Army officials interviewed by Military.com noted. They don't see a single cause to the recruiting problem, but pointed to a confluence of issues for Army recruiting, including partisan scrutiny of the service, a growing obesity epidemic and an underfunded public education system.

When you go on Conservative forums you find a stark difference from the days where they venerated the army as an institution. They complain about, in no particular order: anti-white discrimination, forced COVID-vaccines, women being able to join, promoting gays, futile and costly wars since WW2, etc. 

America is not alone either, Europe too struggles. [Why are European armies struggling to recruit soldiers?](https://www.euronews.com/2024/02/16/why-are-european-armies-struggling-to-recruit-soldiers) 

>European countries' efforts to strengthen their armies in the face of the increased threat from Russia have clashed against young Europeans' unwillingness to join the armed forces. 

>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has pushed European countries to increase their military spending and strengthen their defence, as they scramble to reverse the shrinking of their armies that has occurred over the past decade or so.

>But their efforts have met a huge challenge: a lack of recruits willing to join their military forces...

With several conflicts that threaten the Global American Empire (GAE) like Russia vs. Ukraine, Taiwan vs. China and Israel vs. Palestine there seems to be a slow realization that society have alienated men and now the chicks are coming home to roost. 

*So* what is the solution? 

One, the article mention is granting citizenship for military service in order to use immigrants, taking a cue from the market. There
s an internal debate between the conservatives on the issue of leaving the military services because that means outsiders will fill your slot and so the nation will be at the mercy of immigrants instead of native sons. They often cite Roman history about foreign legions.  

Perhaps there will be greater benefits to entice men into war? Another debate in conservative circles is whether this dilemma will force the elites to put the woke(TM) away for a while to incentivize men into sacrifice. Recent Army Ads that have returned to standard strategic instead of trying to pander to urban progressive have been less than successful. See the ratio and comments on, [First Jump

356,o450nn,2021-06-20,stupidpol,Against Workplace democracy - The False god of the western left,"One thing i am becoming more and more aggrieved with is this idea in the heads of western leftists (Both actual Marxists, Wannabee radical Social-Democrats and Radlibs) is the idea that ""Workplace Democracy"" (The implementation of Liberal-Democratic values into the actual workplace) is the BE ALL END ALL of Marxism or some other logic. Which is striking to me because Marx literally never calls for workplace democracy in the sense that these people talk about it or ""expanding democracy"" (Marx is almost always talking about creating a system where 'Democracy' is just scrapped entirely) I have four main objections to this.

**.1 - Marxism is not about ""expanding democracy""**

Marx pretty much always describes socialism/communism as a system with such efficiency and with such abundance that the NEED for Democracy is literally abolished. People no longer NEED to have elections or debates over the topics we discuss in our modern-age because these problems would be considered just...administrative work...Something an official or a computer can do with much more ease then an entire government.

**.2 - workplace democracy will not be able to account for bullshit jobs, socially or ecologically destructive jobs or the natural failure rate of the firm under a market structure.**

No matter the amount of ""Democracy"" you implement at a particular firm it will not make thats firms existence any more rational then it was under capitalism. The LibLeft argument of how ""collectivisation"" would help women who have been forced into prostitution (literally ""members owned sex trafficking"") is asinine and obviously would never work. Introducing workplace-democracy at every coal mine and oil-rig on earth seems somewhat redundant when rationally we need to begin moving to using different sources of energy for ecological reasons. And finally if the only change you are making to our current system is attempting to turn all workers into a ""collective-capitalist"" that run their buisness together then ALL of their fates become tied to the success of their firm. If market forces turn against them and their business collapses then we end up right back at square one  

**3. - Workplace democracy will not make the economy any more rational, It is ALREADY as rational as it can be in most industries under capitalism.**

Capitalism already attempts to have as few people, doing the least work, to churn out the most output, in the shortest amount of time or intervals of time possible. for a firm to be viable it simply must be doing that. So in order for the workplace-democracy crowd to claim this will have positive economic results they should have to prove this will result in even more rational economic decision making. I dont believe this is possible as most firms are guided by necessity  if a firm is guided in their needed ""output"" by ""need"" in the form of orders what can workers even necessarily vote for themselves that wouldn't already be obviously self apparent (""well fuck if we hope to meet this deadline we'll probably need at least 4 people in M to F then maybe...jim to manage it all during the weekend rush and...sue maybe? to work in the office and hold the phone?"")

**4. - Workplace democracy if implemented in the way that Social-Democrats and RadLibs describe it could result in an extremely (for lack of a better word) Totalitarian society, This stems from the only thing you can reasonably vote on with 'Workplace democracy'...**

Culture.

Almost immediately after this would be theoretically implemented we could see both Rightoid IdPol and RadLib IdPol enter the workplace in an invasive fashion in which your political opinions could literally determine your employment depending on if they align with the majority of other members of the firm",MoltenBallofHatred,t2_3xr7kkcs,0.61,7,9

359,q70fme,2021-10-13,stupidpol,Wrote my midterm paper on Conflict theory in the workplace between employee and employers (700 words),"I’m submitting this tomorrow night, any thoughts, advice? Or just read for enjoyment. 

Conflict Theory Within the Workplace
​
         
This Sociology class has made me more aware of social institutions that we partake in everyday, knowing, or unknowing. A social institution that stands out to me because we all must partake in it, is our jobs that produce us a living wage. These jobs create relationships, roles, statuses, and socialize us to norms in our society. A hierarchy is created to make a company run smoothly, with most American companies having roles in place for the stratification of employees. Therefore, I would like to dissect conflict theory in the workplace, looking at how different roles may create tension between employees, and employers, and looking at how this social institution influences your prestige outside of this role. ​

         To define the workplace I will be using, “A status or role that earns you a wage in currency to live”, the workplace does not have to be a physical store, for example someone may work from home, or travel for a job. The workplace is more of a metaphor for the social institution itself, and the effects it creates on the people who work there. I will explain how different roles cause different viewpoints of a workplace, explain how conflict arises over different viewpoints. Also, personal experiences of conflict with employers, and how everyday social life is stratified by these conflicts.
 
The Body
​
​      
The different viewpoints of the workers physical materialism vs a boss’s physical materialism are what stratifies a workplace. An employee (a proletariat) walking to work may see the physical working building as a necessity, a task to fulfill other tasks in life, such as getting food, and to pay rent. Where a boss, or Bourgeois upperclassmen may see the material building as a shining accomplishment of their production, and/or work value. A study by Yale University finds that only 28% of employees feel that their job is a life calling (Wrzesniewski, 1997).

         How these different roles view the workplace also influences decisions, where an employee may care more about the singular role they have, to fulfill that role, not because they like the boss, but for the currency they earn. While the boss makes decisions for the wellbeing of the business, to sustain it, not because he necessarily cares for the employees but to continue a legacy. This conflict is held in turmoil by a “master slave dichotomy”, with both sides needing one another in symbiosis while warily understanding that one side holds far more power. The power shifted toward the top of American companies is disproportionate with only 10.8 percent of employees being in a union, whereas in 1983 double, 20.1 percent, were unionized (BLS,2020).
 
          A personal experience of conflict theory in the workplace for me would be my time in the restaurant business. A restaurant is an incredibly diverse workplace, it’s the only job where I have seen people who make 100+ grand a year work alongside hourly workers for the goal of getting food to the customer. It does boil down to 3 levels of hierarchy, the owner, the management, and the workers. The management experienced role conflict, with them making a considerable amount more of money, they could afford to live in nicer neighborhoods, have higher prestige, and have more of a voice in the company. All while balancing a relationship with hourly workers, working alongside them, earning their trust, and understanding that they have management above them, it was a 1 foot in both doors’ scenarios, that bridged all hierarchies together.

         Outside of the workplace, in terms of the conflict between employees and employers, this conflict transcends into day-to-day life. A worker is expected to work 40-50 hours a week, giving them less time with family and for hobbies. While an owner makes gratuity just by owning the business giving them more free time. It is also more prestigious to be known as an owner in a community, than an hourly wage worker. The biggest way this conflict transcends into personal life is living situations, bourgeois owners accumulate in certain neighborhoods, while workers of different companies accumulate in others.",InformativeO,t2_dovm9kkw,0.9,7,9

361,16gz50f,2023-09-12,stupidpol,Personal account of the worst labor camp in my hometown,"You may find it challenging to read this account to the end, but it's essential to remember the tens of thousands who perished due to the atrocities of our communist regime.

A tale of survival from a Bulgarian detainee at the death camp near Lovech:

Kolyo Kolev endured over a year at the ""Sunny Beach"" death camp near Lovech. He is among the handful who survived, many of whom were destined for elimination. On numerous records, the chilling note reads: ""return undesirable"". Kolev's account stands as a stark reminder of one of our history's gravest offenses. It highlights the brutal nature of a system that once proclaimed, ""Man is friend and brother."" The cruelty exhibited by the enforcers might even astonish their NKVD predecessors.

Women were housed in a separate wing of the camp, yet they worked alongside us. They faced relentless abuse. Unspeakable acts were done to them. In the evenings, some were washed from the waist down before being taken to the offices, where they endured constant assault without any means to resist, knowing that resistance meant certain death. The conditions were horrifying. Our hands were frequently bloodied. We hauled stones with bare hands and slept out of sheer exhaustion. The presence of snakes was a constant threat. Basic necessities were a luxury, and the overwhelming stench of infection and perspiration was stifling. Mornings smelled of decay. During summer, the intense heat made the rocks hot enough to fry an egg. Yet, by winter, the biting cold was only noticeable until we began our grueling tasks. From dawn to dusk, we labored, our sweat mixing with blood. Mircho Spasov demanded ""endless work"" and leisure was a foreign concept. A young boy from Glogan, discovered to be an orphan landowner, was executed. My only ally was a man from Sofia who arrived just days before me. Many tried to escape, but all attempts were in vain. Those caught were executed as a lesson to us. A particular gypsy was tasked with counting us, and mistakes led to punishments as a means to extract information. Occasionally, groups of 20-30 were selected for labor at the BCP villa on a nearby hill. The construction materials we transported were used to build this palace through forced labor. Certain guards would place a stick in our path, and anyone who stumbled over it faced brutal beatings or worse.

The killings were carried out in various ways: 

Using clubs, tools, knives, and by strangulation. On the day they killed Ivan Karadochev, I miraculously survived. I had worked with him in a group for two or three months. Shaho struck him hard with a club, and he fell. I shouted out and cradled him. Ivan died in my arms. Then I heard a yell, and at the last moment, I saw Shaho swinging his lethal instrument. It was a rod attached to his hand, from which a thin, extremely sharp steel strip of about 20 cm was hung by a chain. He often demonstrated its sharpness by showing it could shave his arm. With one swift move, he would kill with it. If it reached someone's neck, the person died instantly; if it hit someone's back, the wound would be bone-deep. People either bled to death or the wounds would fester and become infested with maggots. On that very day, tears streaming from my eyes, Bozhidar shouted loudly, ""Watch out!"" I looked up – the steel strip was whistling towards my head. I instinctively pulled back, and in the position I was in, the blade left two deep cuts – on my arm and leg. The scars remain to this day. Shaho wanted to finish me off, but just then, Gazdov called him down to the barracks for ""something important."" This meant new people had arrived, and there was work for him. There were two girls and a boy from Burgas. They were accused of waiting in short skirts on the pier for American sailors to arrive. They tortured the three all night. The cries of pain could be heard throughout, even though they tried to muffle them. How many times they were assaulted, no one knows. By morning, the boy was dead. The girls, with torn clothes, disheveled and bloodied, were led out from the officers' quarters.

The gnoyasals and worms wounds by Georgi, the felsher, cured in two ways. Either he made someone younger urinate on the wound, or with peeled eyelids he knocked and wiped out the worms. Every sick person was condemned. Once a man jumped out of the silos. He wanted to run away on the train, but he fell on the rails and the car passed through his legs. He was taken to the hospital after two hours with amputated legs. They threw him into the morgue behind the toilet and he died in terrible torment. He was alive between corpses, begging for water, walling. I also remember Dancho from Plovdiv. He was left with two banknotes of 25 leva, and he decided on 19 January, Yordanovden, to buy a birthday and name, he was doing 24 years. He asked a senior to buy the bulbs with the money, but the militant handed it over. Gazda called him in front of the building. He was tied to a wheel with his hands raised. He was in a high school gymnast, the dress went up and bare his body. It was very cold, 15 ⁇  below zero. Gazdov ordered every two hours to flood it with water. Each bucket said to him, ""Do you know that for a name and birthday it is watering for health?"" Two days left on a car and did not stop watering it. On the third Gazdov came as a knight of a horse in his career and dragged Dancho, tied with a rope for the saddle. He was still alive, covered with ice. We were gathered to see him. ""Is there anyone else who wants to celebrate?"" Dancho said, ""Brothers ... I ... goaam..."" And he died. They brought a boy from Gabrovo, his parents were great men, sent him to scare him. He had confidence, but on the third day he was killed. A few days later, they searched for him. First they said he was gone, then he went away. They forced several people to collect a finger and put a cross of two squats. But the mother felt with her instinct that she was lying to her. He broke the dust and realized that there was no grave. We did not know then that the bodies taken to Belene were buried shallowly and torn by the grated pigs.



A boy from Gabrovo, whose parents were influential figures, was sent there to be intimidated. He had self-confidence, but by the third day, they killed him. A few days later, they went looking for him. First, they claimed he wasn't there, then said he had tried to escape. They forced several people to gather soil and place a cross made of two sticks. But his mother, with a mother's instinct, sensed they were lying. She dug up the soil and realized there was no grave. We didn't know back then that the bodies transported to Belene were shallowly buried and torn apart by pigs ravenous for the carcass.

There were no traitors among us, I'm sure of it. We didn’t speak to each other – it was forbidden. We were ordered to speak loudly. When you talked to someone, it had to be audible from at least 25-30 meters away. If you asked for something – a hammer, a tool – and the guards decided they hadn't heard, it meant that in seconds, both the speaker and the listeners would be dead. That was the rule. We only got to know one name and where someone was from – Stefan from Vratsa, Sasha Sladura. I remember him, though I didn't see his death. They said he was a great musician. The camp was filled mostly with highly educated and cultured people – the perceived threat to the ""peaceful communism."" There were lawyers, people's representatives, etc. Nikola from Sofia was sent there for speaking to foreigners at the ""Bulgaria"" hotel. There were men in their 40s, 50s, and 58. They didn't last long.

I remember two boys – whether they were Macedonian, I don't know, we called them ""Serbs."" Micho escaped, but they caught him. They killed him very brutally. The date July 19th is forever etched in my memory. Explosives were placed, and twenty people were ordered to ignite the fuses. The fuses were very short. At one point, the entire group exploded. Bodies, heads, legs, and rocks were scattered everywhere. Two to three minutes later, the order came to ""gather the flesh into the cart."" And we were made to ""clean up."" It was a massacre. You'd grab a hand, it would still be twitching; you'd pick up a leg, and it would be warm. Elsewhere there were entrails. I still feel sick when I remember July 19th, 1959. Some tried to escape, but the guards shot from the rocks, killing several. On average, the camp held about 240-250 people. Many newcomers couldn't withstand the initial beating; they'd collapse, or they'd be killed on the spot.

Those half-alive would be thrown into the ""morgue"" and, once dead, would be taken with the other corpses to Belene by cart. The daily ration was 260 grams of stale black bread, as dark as a cinder block. Some kind of tea-like beverage was provided morning and evening. The body needs fluids. Sometimes they'd serve soup made from rotting fish heads that reeked. I've seen people eating grass and leaves just to moisten their mouths. But they'd swallow it. We drank water from barrels that were never cleaned, only refilled. At the bottom, there was muck and filth. There was no water at the quarry. We had a wooden restroom, but no one dared linger for long. Several were shot or slaughtered as they squatted.

The carts were pushed along rails for 150-200 meters. You aimed to be neither first nor last because a group that ranked first three times would be disbanded. A sick or disabled person would be added to it. To be frank, he was of no use. He was a burden on the others who had to meet the quota, and failure meant death. While I was there, they might have killed around 1000 people. I didn't count, but it couldn't have been fewer than 800. And that's just in one year.

Once, Mircho Spasov gave a speech.

At that moment, Vasko from Strumyani interrupted, ""Comrade Colonel (he was a colonel at the time), why are we here without a trial and verdict? Why can't we write or receive letters?"" Mircho Spasov responded, ""You are gathered here not to serve a punishment or to survive, but for physical and sterile elimination, because you are the seeds of the rotten American capitalism."" And if anyone thought of becoming a bird to fly over the wire fences, they would instantly become a heron that wouldn't let even a feather out. Vasko was then marked. Within a week, Vasko was gone. For me, the most guilty are Mircho Spasov and the party. He claimed it was a party order and he had to feed his children. But they were monsters, hungry for power, willing to kill and rage. Today, it weighs on me that several people died because of me. Before my imprisonment, I was a wrestler. When Lovech became a district, there were no competitors in my weight category, so they sought me for a competition. The guards learned that a wrestler was arriving and killed several larger and stronger men. They didn't know who it was; I weighed only 40 kilograms. One morning, I saw them coming for me, and I trembled in fear. I told Bozhidar that this was the end; they would kill me today. He whispered for me not to be afraid. Later, Gazdov called me. I approached, and he swung his club at me. As I fell, he stepped on my head, and my ear was crushed against the rocks. Then I heard a shout, ""Enough!"" He dropped the club and said, ""If you come back, you won't wake up. And if you do wake up, you won't see dusk."" I left, fell onto the path, grabbed two handfuls of soil, and kissed it. I still cherish it to this day.

Later, I watched the movie ""Spartacus"" at least 20 times, which starts with slave labor in a quarry. It doesn't even come close to the horror of our camp, but I cried every time. When I attended the first commemoration on April 12, 1990, I took a few steps and collapsed. That's how all the survivors reacted. There, I saw Bozhidar and Nadya Dunkin; she was like a little sister to me. We just cried on each other's shoulders.

When today, I am asked to say or write something, it is always this: ""Never, never again human violence!""

Mircho Spasov was a Bulgarian politician from the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP), serving as the Deputy Interior Minister in the People's Republic of Bulgaria (NRB). As one of the closest allies of Todor Zhivkov, he organized and directed the camps near Lovech and Skravena. Spasov was also in charge of smuggling channels and responsible for diverting millions of leva from the ""Cultural Heritage"" service to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During the investigation into the crimes at the Lovech camp, all of the camp leadership testified that no written orders were ever given, but actions were solely based on verbal directives from Mircho Spasov. He justified the imprisonment of people without trial or verdict in camps as a ""fight against rotten American capitalism."" According to him, the inmates were the seeds of this capitalism, meant to be subjected to ""physical and sterile elimination.""

In 1990, due to the atrocities committed near the Lovech camp, Spasov was expelled from the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), and the then-president Petar Mladenov stripped him of his general's rank. An investigation was launched against Spasov and the leadership of the Lovech camp by the Chief Prosecutor at the time, Ivan Tatarchev. Spasov confessed, justifying his actions by stating he was following the example of his Soviet comrades. On June 8, 1993, the trial began, with Ivan Tatarchev personally advocating for death sentences. Spasov died a month after the start of the trial, in his home, where he was under house arrest.",jerichoholic1,t2_64ga0,0.52,2,21

367,hfhdty,2020-06-25,stupidpol,I have a theory as to why rural working class people identify more with capitalism than with socialism.,"I lived in a small banana town for a year and a half. I ended up having many conversations about our local welfare distribution center, the character of the people who needed it, and so-on. 

Every day you'd see roughly two or three waves of employees go to work. You'd see the 5am shift, which is when the farm labourers, council workers, and just about anyone surrounding the agricultural industry begin to start their work. 

Then there was the 8am shift, which is when the cafes, banks, shops, schools, and any other indoors, air-conditioned business began to open.

Then there were the casual workers and the unemployed, which generally hung around town during the day without doing anything in particular. 

So if we look at the labour theory of value, exploitation is a dollar earned by an owner of the means of production was a dollar not paid to the worker. When the 5am starters would finish their shift in the afternoon, they'd leave work, go past the shops, buy some cigarettes and some alcohol to relax and they'd see the unemployed hanging around in the parks.

Of course everybody knew that the unemployed were getting benefits, and some were getting extra money to have their students attend a certain number of school days. While the farm workers would see the people who own the farm right alongside them; they drove tractors, fixed leaking pipes, and were workers themselves that happened to own property. While the unemployed owned nothing, and did nothing, and were rewarded with a wage as well. 

So these conservative laborers saw themselves in distinct categories - people who work hard (labourers and business owners) - people who work easy jobs (bankers, baristas) and people who didn't work at all, but still being paid.  Those are the lines that they divide themselves along.

The people who are on unemployment benefits are seen as the rent-seekers that we accuse the bourgeoisie as being. When I defended the unemployment payments and people who didn't want to work, I tried to remind them of the people who earned millions, if not billions of dollars in profit in a given year. There's a limit to how much someone can work, but not a limit to how much they can be paid. 

""Well, it's because they're smart enough to figure out how to make that money in the first place.""

I think they'd be ripe for the picking to be converted to socialists if they were exposed to more examples of the wealthy class exploiting the workers and living off the labour of others on several orders of magnitude more than welfare recipients. But I just thought it was interesting how this worked, and I got to see the other side of it.",Feynmanprinciple,t2_6mk97j7y,0.94,206,141
368,k4vbfs,2020-12-01,stupidpol,Immigrant Labor and Freed Slave Labor,"In a lot of the typical discussions around immigrant labor I've found many parallels to the discussions that circulated around the abolitionist movements in the 18th and 19th centuries. They were concerned with the political question of what to do with the slaves once they have been emancipated. At the time, these movements were the concrete expression of the internal contradictions of the slave system. However, the abolitionist movement came in different ""waves"" according to the time period, and the first wave of abolitionists failed in their mission because they formulated the problem primarily in Christian moralist language. Note also that many early abolitionist thinkers were ardent racists mainly looking out for their own selfish interest, and many supported the reactionary [Back to Africa movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-to-Africa_movement) as a solution to the problem of slavery. I say this not to disparage the abolitionist movement, but to say that sometimes Leftists don't have the luxury of picking and choosing who their allies are in the class war.

Anyway, the second wave of abolitionist struggle culminated in the [Free Soil Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Soil_Party), which would later become the Republican Party. This was effectively the vanguard party of white ""free laborers"". As the United States kept expanding westward and the government tried to maintain the balance of power between slave power representation and northern industrial free states, they made the argument that the *Slaveocracy* was buying up all the *land* for the slave industry, while barely throwing any morsels of land for the free white homesteaders. Add to this the famous [caning of Charles Sumner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caning_of_Charles_Sumner), which added ammunition that the *Slaveocrats* were working to undermine free speech and democratic institutions for free white laborers. In this way, they were able to *establish concretely a shared common class interest* between slave labor and free white labor. The abstract political questions whose contradictions were first manifested *in theory* were then resolved by a practical cross-racial movement *in reality*. And although there were still a lot of problems afterwards: freed slaves basically took up the same jobs they were previously doing, at pennies on the dollar and driving down wages, the KKK and Reconstruction and all the rest, nonetheless it showed only a united class movement was able to abolish the institution of slavery.

The division between white free labor and black slave labor parallels the division between immigrant and native labor today. But is there a way to concretely identify mutual class interests between these two seemingly disparate groups?",AStupidpolLurker0001,t2_68h2s49v,0.75,6,6

Wish the NYTimes would publish my OP-Ed: is performing financial hocus pocus with billionaires' assets really working?

Stephen Rattner, author of the linked article, runs a private equity firm and has made his career primarily through connections and privilege. He was an advisor to Obama's Treasury department and helped guide the auto industry bailout. He's also a lifelong Democrat who fundraised for the Clintons.

He entertains the notion that working from home is white collar privilege. It no doubt is. But it's hilarious to me that he thinks this is all due to laziness, as opposed to technology and Americans' realization that daily office drudgery is superfluous and performative for salaried workers.

I know, I know, this is just typical NYTimes condescension aimed at the plebs, but I always find it funny to see capitalists talk up labor-- when the central tenant of capitalism is to disproportionately reward passive ownership over labor.

Effectively that means four months because I started mid month, and it's taken weeks to get my insurance plan set up. I have spent the past four months using my stockpile of insulin pump supplies that I had saved up for an emergency like unemployment. Now that I finally have insurance, it has taken weeks to get the supply company to process my insurance and send me my prescriptions that I literally don't know how to live without. When I run out in four days, I will have to switch to shots, which I have not used since I was a child. I also don't have a prescription for long-acting insulin (you don't need it if you are wearing a pump), and I can't get one because I can't get into an endocrinologist in the town I moved to *until March*. If this company can't get their shit together and mail me my supplies ASAP, I have no idea what I will do.

The irony is that there is a diversity and inclusion officer *on the executive team*. The only person more powerful is the CEO. I wrote a long complaint about this issue to her, explaining that if I had not been able to save a backlog of supplies, I would have spent $5,000 on prescriptions over the last three months. This is clearly a diversity and inclusion issue since it only effects people with chronic illness or disabilities, and is a much more material issue than the normal language policing, but since it would cost the company money, they won't do anything about it. She just forwarded my complaint on to HR, who sent me an email letting me know that the three month probationary period ""is legal."" Great, that makes me feel better.

 UPDATE

Thank you everyone for your advice. I  finally got the company to process my insurance and overnight me my  supplies. It turns out they were trying to contact the wrong insurance  company.

Obviously the three month  policy isn't directly responsible for this, but it is responsible for  me almost running out of supplies because I couldn't afford them  out-of-pocket.",TurkeyFisher,t2_wf6ym,0.97,618,145

For example, all gyms got closed. The gym owners raised a stink and staged a protest in Warsaw. I took a look at the article. 

Turns out  92% of gyms failed to get covered by the protective financial scheme because… they didn't employ even one person. All work was contract work, and contract work is for freelancers, creatives, and service providers. Picking up phone at the gym is not a contract work, but many employers use it to skirt the labor laws.

So, in a roundabout way they fucked themselves with their greed. But their employees suffered twice: they had shit jobs and now they will be unemployed.

So why did #MeToo not improve women's lot in the workplace while also making men more paranoid (and we automatically have to assume that all men who are more paranoid now are guilty of sexual assault or harassment -- don't ask for evidence)?

I do think it was awesome that VICE paid for institutionalizing predatory sexual behavior (like forcing the employees to party with their bosses all the time, so someone with literal dictatorial power over you can abuse you in and outside the workplace).

I noticed also more and more corporate retail industrial complexes investing less into their loyal employees, could explain why corporations like Walmart, Best Buy, IKEA, Target and Walgreens are cutting costs with employee-investor relations and instead are just choosing to go more and more the automation route. Now, one could say is always been this way, but one has to wonder, have retail workers become more easily replaceable during the pandemic then?

This thread popped up and it really got me thinking about what identity based evangelicalism has done to the country. 

There's no disagreement with me about feeling rewarded after a day of hard work. Doesn't even to be ""paid"" necessarily. Can be something as little as planting a garden or cooking a meal.

The issue is yes, one should be compensated fairly for their labor and not be exploited by the system that allows for blatant exploitation.  I happen to believe that giving a UBI would force say, McDonalds into having to pay their employees a living wage and benefits to compete against such a thing.  I think that's a better route as it doesn't force those into desperate circumstances where they are forced to work for a tyrannical manager.

401,qjvouf,2021-10-31,stupidpol,The coming revival of labor power,"Though Keynesian economics brought widespread prosperity in the United States, by the 1970s it had fallen into crisis. Falling rates of profit---a tendency inherent to any capitalist system---made it impossible for businesses to invest in expansion, or to meet worker demands for increased wages. The oil crises of 1973 and 1979 and the high interest rates of 1979-82 added to these pressures, hitting heavy industry (the most capital-intensive sector) especially hard. As these industries were liquidated/offshored, they gave way to more profitable (for investors) endeavors: finance, real estate, healthcare, and (by the 1990s) information technology, where employment generally required college education.

Financial institutions, university administrators, and governments exploited this desperation to the fullest---as [the proportion of young people in college nearly doubled](https://www.statista.com/statistics/236093/higher-education-enrollment-rates-by-age-group-us/) **from 1980-2008,** [**higher education increased in cost**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=IoN6) **twice as rapidly (at least!) as general inflation. This increased income inequality,** even among workers ([median income fell behind mean](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=InKp)) and reduced social mobility, as [low-income people found it difficult](https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/media/SES.jpg) to pay for college. There's a specifically racial dimension as well: blacks, who had [lower homeownership rates](https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/3/HO-by-Race-Main-ed08f4.png) than whites due to redlining policies, lacked in the way of home equity and thus had to finance college with high-interest student loans.

The good news is that these material conditions have finally begun to clear up. **After decades of stagnation, since \~2012 median family income (not just average)** [**has shown sustained growth**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=InKp) **with a stable labor share of income.** Since the bailout of the American auto industry, [manufacturing employment has held stable](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=IoQt) for almost a decade, following years of decline (thanks Obama!).

As a member of the Left, the Left is pathetic. We need to face reality, that we are being *crushed*.

We have had not one major victory in the last half century which has had any significant positive impact on the working class. Too many of us still deceive ourselves into thinking the Democratic party represents us while they deflect responsibility for any measure of competent leadership and push legislation which further marginalizes the *actual* socioeconomic condition of POCs, further strips the working class of what little they have left, gleefully bombs foreigners for no good reason, and further devastates our people with a murderous for-profit ""healthcare system"" which is an utter affront to every positive development in the history of human social thought and ethics. 

We keep having the same dumb. ass. debates. year after year reestablishing established facts ad nauseum because we have substituted action on our problems for cultural signaling and social bickering. Face it: our 'Leftist' party has no sufficient interest to pass M4A during a pandemic when people are going bankrupt and dying at staggering rates, and this policy has the support of the majority of Americans across political lines. 

Wake. Up. I love bread and circuses as much as any of you, but if we do not put the soma down (Netflix, etc.) and collect together, organize, and engage in direct action where they either give us what we want or we take their jobs and throw them on the street...we are not going to see any revival of what is good in the American spirit, and we will, without doubt, watch ourselves continue a collapse more horrific than we can imagine.

I have worked in non-profits for 5 years distributing hundreds of thousands of pounds of food and raising millions for pantries, case managers, and shelters for the homeless, recently incarcerated, raped, abused, and suicidal. I have not made a dent in the systemic problems which contributed to their abject oppression. The non-profit industrial complex is real. There are no major institutions in our society poised to challenge capitalism, no major dissident party to join, no established path within the rules of the bourgeois system to affect change.

Most of our working lives are either non existant or sheer hell. We go from precarious job to job hoping desperately that the next one won't ruin our mental health, have abusive management, or otherwise simply fire us as soon as we aren't producing. People doing things like working Uber 12 hours a day are not human beings, as Vanis Varoufakis once said, but soulless autonomatons, husks of what were once people. I am not religious, but what this is is systemic spiritual devastation.

Chris Hedges' ""Wages of Rebellion"" is an excellent and moving read about the moral imperative of revolt, about stories like those of inmates who commit to protests in jail demanding their rights all while knowing they are going to be thrown in solitary for the rest of their lives. I don't know about all of you, but I can't work, eat takeout, and sit in front of a screen for 50 more years until I die. I can't.

There is no hope for us except to give up our old hopes for political saviors, electoralism, and decrepit institutions, choosing rather to find new hopes in one another, in solidarity, in strike, protest, broken windows and demands. Now. 

Happy Monday comrades.

Edit: since it apparently needs clarification, by direct action I do not mean performative 'protests' or shit like opening CHAZ, I mean general strikes, shutting down factories and offices, and fucking up the front steps of legislative houses until we get what we fucking demand.

407,17c2dke,2023-10-20,stupidpol,The examination of classism over time in media | Dishonored 1 vs ... Nothing?,"This threads going to suck. (Also specifically addressing non-academic or books) 

Anyway, I really see that there's nothing in the media in fiction in the west that has classism as a focal point. Yes occasionally they'll touch on it, especially with period pieces. However the last major piece of media I can think of that actually spends a good period of time looking at classism is the game dishonored. Which it's sequels forgot about. I don't know how many people here have actually played the series, but the final installment doesn't even glance at classism once.

The last 10 years of media, excluding very specific time pieces like the industrial revolution almost entirely pretend it didn't exist. Sure the game frost punk (which is sorta a period piece) mentions child labor being used, and that rich people had far greater access too education etc giving them an unfair advantage to survive the apocalypse, also that they mistreated the poor, but thats it. That's as far as it's explored despite taking place during the industrial revolution, and one part on the game *specifically addressing the hostilities between the classes* yet that's all thats given. (Still enjoyed frost punk, but it the closest I've seen in a while even acknowledge that there are class difficulties)

Compared to dishonored it, and almost all recent media is so damn dry. For those that haven't touched the dishonored series let me give some examples of the way it deals with class problems.

One villain in the upper class utilizes emminet domain to steel the middle classes/impoverished homes, as well as dissidents. The property is then sold/gifted to members of the upper class.

Another specifically unleashes what is basically the black death onto the poor inorder to decrease their numbers, and withholds the cure and innoculations (which are only distributed to the police and upper class)

The police have absolutely nothing that deals with their behavior, in one scene a mother is killed for having a healing potion for her child actively dying, because, the police simply want it.

Multiple members of the upper class more or less rape their maids by removing their ability to consent. One common example being the line of dialogue ""I can't afford to lose this job, so, if he says to bring him food, I bring him food, if he says to bring wine, I bring wine, if he says to undress I undress..."" Etc etc

It also addresses the elite weaponising the working class against the working class. 

One fantastic example of this is a labor strike taking place in a horrific factory with no safety system with 12 hour work days doing labor in a factory for the production of whale oil. An incredibly grueling and dangerous task. The labor strike is organized by a spy sent in by a rival factory owner, the strike is by the state declared illegal, and all members are beaten/fired. The terms given to them are a 25% pay reduction, and lashings if they want to keep their job. The workers are tortured until they accept the terms inorder to break the strike. While the different departments don't always strike as they have been turned against each other. One bit of dialogue being ""So what do those morons want anyway?""
""They want the right to refuse dangerous work.""
""What dangerous work? We're the ones that do the real dangerous work.""
""Don't say that ever again, even as a joke, or I'll gut you!""


These are only a few of hundreds of examples, but I think the point is clear.

The actual look at the suffering of the lower class is basically dead in modern media, beyond corporate yappy ""omg white me bad"" or ""omg child labor in the 1800's bad"" without any level of actual analysis.

421,q510t9,2021-10-10,stupidpol,Immigrant Workers Are No Different Than Native Workers,"Increased immigration is NOT a capitalist position, it is simply a non-nativist position and is not only compatible but necessary when speaking of helping the working class. 

When speaking of immigration, many who desire restrictions on immigration claim that immigrants drive down wages by increasing the labor supply. However this is both not true and those who believe in it hold double standards. 

**The Labor Supply**

What I mean is that the focus is always on immigrants from other countries increasing the labor supply, but people do not care as much if at all about immigrants from other states increasing the local labor supply, or immigrants to your town from the one next door, or complaints about your neighbor increasing the labor supply. The youth who grow old enough to get jobs are also adding to the labor supply, yet no one complains about them. The logical conclusion of restricting immigration due to labor supply is that the labor supply must be restricted which leads to the conclusion that one desires to be the only person with access to the job market. 

Another point is that the job market is not a static thing. If there is immigration, then there is increased demand, which means that companies will have to create more jobs to meet that demand. There is no such thing as running out of jobs, we can always and always do create more jobs. 

**Alternatives to Immigration Restriction**

Also, entertaining the idea that immigrants drive down wages, wages cannot be driven below the minimum wage, so why not just raise the minimum wage to a decent wage?

There are other solutions to the increased labor supply, such as a federal jobs guarantee and other wage laws not counting the minimum wage. 

A big problem in regards to illegal immigration is that companies exploit them given that they either take a job that pays below minimum wage or they risk getting deported. This can be resolved by simply extending protections to illegal immigrants by legalizing them, so that they are fully protected by existing labor laws and companies no longer have the threat of deportation to force them into horrible job contracts. 

The ideal is always worker ownership, so that workers determine wages and jobs for the benefit of all workers, which include immigrants. 

If some people are going to put in all the effort to restrict immigration, why not instead put that effort into alternatives that help everyone?

**What Actually Determines Wages**

An increased labor supply also does not dictate wages. A minimum wage dictates the lowest a wage can be. The owner of a company dictates your wage after complying with wage laws. Your wage = the company revenue - non-labor expenses - what the company owners want to keep for themselves (profit) - the wages of other workers (both low and high level) + the minimum wage. Revenue can be increased by raising prices, and the excessive wages of top level management as well as the profit kept by the shareholders is a huge chunk that could be going to you and other lower level workers. However, capitalists want to maximize profits, which means they will always seek to lower your wages and pay off top level management with ridiculously high wages to work to keep you in line. The labor supply only factors in if there are more jobs than people, which will never be the case long term as the system always move towards having more labor than jobs, always, given that if you can't find workers, then the venture isn't sufficiently profitable, therefore the capitalist closes up shop or simply operate at lower production until there are once again less jobs than workers. 

If capitalists see local wages rise, they WILL offshore jobs, collude to keep wages low, increase automation, work at lower productivity, or just close up shop. Because they don't need all of us, they only need enough workers in key sectors to keep things functioning, the rest of commerce is excess that can be cut, as the system only works if they keep a large lower class that has no choice but to work to survive and so they can dictate the terms, and therefore wages. 

**Restricting Immigration Hurts Workers Without Helping Any Workers**

A big point as well is the fact that immigrants ARE the working class just as much as native workers. When you restrict immigration, you're saying some workers matter more than other. The answer to why some matter more is always a nativist/nationalist position, it is identity politics completely, an arbitrary distinction based on superficial traits that has material impacts on many people. 

The solution, the only one that makes any sense and is not one that harms other workers (immigrants) and has any hope of helping native workers as well, is socialism, where wages are dictated by the workers, not the tiny group of capitalists, as the workers are the owners. 

Anti immigration will not raise wages or the supply of jobs, it will simply hurt other workers and allow capitalists to keep hurting all workers. Anti immigration is simply idpol, no different from wokes who want to decrease the labor supply for the ""Other"" through affirmative action, ""representation"", etc.",JCMoreno05,t2_14xsjg,0.45,0,34

Are there any obscure voices in the Republican Party actually advocating pro-working class policy?","I was reading my daily diet of conservative propoganda this morning when I stumbled upon an [article](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2023/02/04/union_membership_reaches_new_low_big_labor_to_blame_148819.html) written by Sen. Marco Rubio. The article struck me as particularly intriguing, because Marco Rubio does raise well-attested points about how many American unions have been captured by conglomerate political interests in the United States. He points to the rail unions as an example of union leadership prioritizing DNC interests over the interests of their membership. But then, of course in true American political fashion, he ties all of his rhetoric and genuine points into a thesis of why workers should rally around a different policy that... you guessed it, helps big businesses screw workers.

Now, anyone familiar with the factionalism inside the Republican Party since the end of the Bush-era understands that Marco Rubio is the ultimate rhetorical shapeshifter. He rose to the Senate as a Tea Partier and shifted his views to align with the Blob when Fox News started calling him the ""Republican Obama"". Eventually became one of Donald Trumps biggest advocates in the Senate after getting cucked by Chris Christie in his POTUS run.

These days, the biggest grifters inside the Republican Party, the guys who will literally pander to anyone because they just want power, have all been adopting their strategies right out of the DNC playbook: dress pro-corporate policy in pro-working class rhetoric.

Nearly all of the media-savey non-ideolgues in the Republican Party, guys like [Sen. Ted Cruz](https://texassignal.com/contradicting-his-entire-career-ted-cruz-claims-to-be-a-champion-for-unions/), who used to stay awake at night schemeing to trick evangelicals into gifting them power, are now switching their targets to the working class as the populist institution of Protestant Christianity collapses under the cultural erosion of late-stage capitalism.

***The point of this post is***, if there are now enough working class people in the Republican Party that the *grifters* are running to the working class... it means that there will likely soon be room for someone that is ideologically, not *just* rhetorically, pro-working class to rise in the Republican Party. Not necessarily to the top, but to influence.

I thought you all would appreciate seeing this specimen of what language that absolutely centers the owner class looks like, where employees who are doing work that is demanded of them that allows the business to be functional and profitable are seen as ""labor costs"" to be derided. I share this because it's very far from an isolated incident but instead a recurring theme among American and other rightwingers where employees are derided and sneered at as burdens that are at best tolerated rather than the labor that allows their economic activity and way of life to even be given the opportunity to exist. This helps to break down the will of workers as a class because they further forget how much power they could wield if they withheld their labor.",Tausendberg,t2_w59bt,0.98,167,23

Such a thesis has gained a lot of traction in the now wildly popular with the online left book ""Settlers"" by J Sakai which states that nearly every labor movement in the US has been false consciousness and supported imperialism. From my understanding Sakai has admitted to starting with his conclusion and working backwards (quote: ""So Settlers was researched backwards. i knew what the conclusion was in the mid-1970s, that white supremacy ruled the white working class except in the self delusions of the Left. ""No politician can ever be too racist to be popular in white amerikkka"", is an amazingly true saying."" https://libcom.org/article/when-race-burns-class-settlers-revisited-interview-j-sakai) and has maligned and frame a lot of history to support his conclusion including revolutionary organizations, but I'm wondering what the overall stupidpol take on this is? For these types it's too easy to blame mccarthyism and they deny the concept of ""brainwashing"" all together and say the people of the USA are wholy unredeemable, but this presents such a misanthropic view and ignores the millions of people that you can get to know just by talking to them.

433,rabbqy,2021-12-06,stupidpol,Anyone Ever Try Lying About Their Race on a Job Application?,"So a good while back my partner and I were visiting some old coworkers from his previous job, and the topic of employee demographics came up. My partner, who had been in the position to hire/fire employees, said very casually: ""Yeah, as a white administrator, I can't just hire a significant amount of white employees unless I want someone from corporate contacting me about my hiring practices."" When I asked him why they would do that if he just hired people based on experience and ability, he said: ""Because that's some you just can't do as a white administrator. It's not okay."" 

Sadly, my partner is a big team player when it comes to absurd guidelines dictated to our facility by its corporate overseers — but I love him anyway.

But the biggest reason their casual acceptance of this ""unwritten rule"" caught me by surprise was that the vast majority of employees where we worked were non-white — most of whom were  immigrants from places like West and North Africa, the Caribbean islands, and Central/South Asia. So even when our building's workforce was far more diverse than most in the area, it was still frowned upon for a white person to hire more than a few white people without ""exceptionally good reason"" — or at least, someone in the company has said/done something to make my partner believe that to be the case.

Jump to present day and we have moved to a different part of the country for my partner's job, and I have been going through the process of sending in job applications. Most of the applications I've filled out for any kind of company with corporate or governmental backing have always ended in the common ""background questionnaire"", where you are asked about your sex/gender, racial/ethnic background, military status, and disability status.

All of these questionnaires begin by stating that ""In accordance with \[federal/state\] law, your answers have no bearing on your application or consideration for employment"" — some of them even have a choice to opt-out of the questionnaire entirely, which is also states to have no functional effect on potential employment. Now, any person would naturally question the veracity of that statement, but after I applied to several places that were owned by the same corporation my partner worked for that implemented a ""race restricted hiring"" culture for white administrators, I began actively clicking ""prefer not to say"" on the race/ethnic background section. So far I haven't heard anything beyond the post-application ""Thank you for applying"" automated e-mail when it comes to all but one of those job positions — but realistically that's not even close to my answer choice being any kind of causality. (It's hardly even confirmation bias.) **For context, I have applied in states that both enforce and outlaw affrimative action practices in employment.**

However, it did give me the idea to start answering the race/ethnic background question with one of the non-white choices. Specfically, whichever choices are directly above or below the ""White/Caucasian"" one on a given application. Then if, I show up for an interview and they say something like, ""On your background application you answered you were African-American/Multi-racial"", I will just respond by feigning surprise and saying I must've accidentally misclicked and didn't notice. Maybe throw in something about how many applications I've filled out and was on auto-pilot during the final questionnaire section. Then see what happens.

Anyway, since I've just logged back into this site for the first time in a while to check up on my favorite sub, I figured I'd ask you guys here if you've ever intentionally lied on that question (or similar ones) before — or legitmately clicked the wrong answer by accident — and made it to the interview process. What happened? Did you get the job?

Can you tell how the endless job application process has left me reetahwdidd?

&#x200B;

**P.S.**

A funny tangent worth mentioning is how a few years ago, during my time at my partner's previous company, a bunch of employees had to take a corporate procedures and policies test to show that we had read and understood a recent update to their ethical and legal guidelines. One of the first slides in the pre-quiz overview was about discrimination in hiring, which said (paraphrasing): 

&#x200B;

>*""At \[name of my facility\], and all other subsidiaries of \[corporation\], any discriminatory practices towards employees, current or potential, based on religion, race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, nationality, or disability, is strictly prohibited.""* 

One thing that stuck out to me about that list — other than the gross reminder of how people with criminal records are ubiquitously shunned still — is there was no mention of sexual orientation. Of course, being gay as hell myself, I told my husband about how that kind of ""typo"" made me laugh during the quiz. But as he informed me, that was no typo — because our facility was in a state that had no legislation that restricts employment discrimination based on sexual orientation, and that it was a calculated move by corporate to not include it in case someone in that area tried suing them for holding the gay man down. Interestingly, they have still fully embraced all trending language and social policy regarding gender identity/trans/non-binary inclusion at the same time.
