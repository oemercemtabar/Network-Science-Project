Like if I'm asking if a friend has seen someone, and I describe him by saying ""A tall black guy, wearing a blue hoodie,"" etc, I'm not being racist, I'm merely describing their looks. If I say something about the colors white and black, I am not a fucking racist, I am merely saying colors.

2, I don't care if you are gay, or lesbian, or bisexual, or whatever. You are still a human and I respect you. Just don't make 'gay' your personality, it's not an attractive thing imo.

3, No, I am not being sexist if I say ""Oh I didn't think that was a girl."" All I am saying is I'm surprised that it was a girl. Like for instance when I found out that Timmy Turner was voiced by a woman, I was suprised because I thought it was a little boy voicing him, not because I thought women couldn't be in the filming industry.

4, I do not care what your body type is. Large, skinny, tall, short, etc. But I have my preferences. I'm not body shaming if I don't want to date a larger woman, that's just not my preference. It's not what I find attractive.

5, idk how this is in people's heads, but I'll say it anyway. NO, I'M NOT HOMOPHOPIC IF I DONTWANT TO DATE A GUY! I am not gay, I do not find men attractive! Idc if you are that way orientated, never have. But I do not care to date a guy. I prefer the company of women.

257,wsdge2,2022-08-19,teenagers,Woman are not real.,"Woman do not exist.

Right.So to start this off I (19M) am not an incel.

So I was hanging out with my cousin Vinny (18M) the other day when he told me ""mate if ya stay home all day on your Xbox going on Elden ring or whatever you will never get yoself a women.Go take a break from reddit and have a shower.""
This statement baffled me.
Firstly it is acshually a PC not a an Xbox (because im not some loser lol). And secondly I do not need to take a break from reddit AGAIN since I already vary my activities greatly.For example I have recently taken up moderating twelve discord servers at the same time and also tweet nineteen times a day.
But the really disturbing part was his last words.
He told me to take a ""shower"" (i am not entirely sure i believe in those either) and that I will never get a women.

What is this object he refers to as ""woman""?

I began scouring the internet and after much research I discovered that woman were those long haired versions of males you see out on the streets.Apparently 50% of the population is them.
This is the part that made me skeptical. If woman make up 50% of the population then how come none of them ever speak to me or touch me??!!!Coincidence? I think not.

Isn't it strange how the same people you see talking about ""women"" as you do discussing ""touching grass"" and ""going outside"".
I believe that Females are a conspiracy theory started by liberals being pulled of by holograms trying to persuade gamers like me to go outside, touch this so called ""grass"" and use these sketchy devices called ""showers"".

Females are not real. The only thing close to them are femboys.Otherwise,women are not real.
Us gamers must stick together and rise up against these conspiracies trying to stop us.

I hate it. It makes me feel weird in my own body. I feel like I have to cover up.  It genuinely creates so much anxiety.

319,cv8vbr,2019-08-25,teenagers,some racist woman thought I was syrian and tried to get me kicked out of a store,"tl;dr is in the title, dumbass.     
Ok, to preface the story, I am a young black male, but only like half black, so I kinda look like a Syrian (just kinda). A lot of Syrians and Arabs have tried talking to me in their language, and I just kinda have to say ""sorry bro I only speak English and German"", but I have never experienced something like in this story.            
So I was in an electronics store in Germany called Saturn, just looking around. I see some laptops with 144hz and 3ms monitors, and I think ""damn, those are thin af!"" so I go over to look at their specs and stuff, and while I am, some old woman (in normal clothes, no uniform) came over to me and pulls out her phone. My first thought: "" Oh god oh fuck please don't ask me for advice with your phone rn I'm really not bothered, I just wanted to look at the new games on sale."" The woman says: ""Hey, you better not start with your Arabic shit, ok?""     
(Side note: this didn't really annoy me because i have experienced a lot of *kinda-racist* moments, but not to the point where the people actually hate me because I'm black)        
So I'm just kinda standing there, still asking her in my head to not annoy me, when she says ""My coworker just told me that you were typing some stuff in a foreign language, and that doesn't work here. you're gonna have to leave."" (remember, I wasn't touching the laptops, just looking at the info)            
so at this point she didn't say what I thought she was gonna say, so I kinda have to process it for a second. and after like 20 seconds of me staring her dead in the eyes, widemouthed, I burst out laughing and walk away. while I'm walking, this woman is like ""bruh you still have to leave"".
Me: ""bruh im not Syrian or Turkish or Arabic. I was born in germany, my mom is German, and the only reason I'm black is because my dad is. you are so fkn dumb please leave me alone""             
at this point the woman is staring with a real ""oh shit"" face, and then walks away. do I go to look at some computer parts and tell my dad about the story. and then, while browsing through video games, I have the revolutionary thought: ""yo if this racist ass woman wants to kick me out for no reason, imma make sure that she gets kicked out."" so I walk over to security and while doing so, I see the racist woman walking over to me. I therefore hurry up to get to security, but it's not worth it, as the woman interrupts me right after I said ""excuse me, sir"". she tells me that her 'co-worker' is ""so terribly sorry"". so this time I cut **her** off and get pissed. so I ask her stuff like ""well why aren't foreigners allowed to type on the keyboards but Germans are"", ""why do you only want to apologise once you realise that I'm not an immigrant"" and ""well if your co-worker is **sooo** sorry, then he can apologise to me personally"". but then my dad comes over, screams ""YOU RACIST"" and dragged me outta there. he then lectured me that if someone is racist to me, I should just call em a racist and leave. I don't believe in that tho, coz you're gonna be pissed off afterwards, and imo, the best way to not become pissed off is to laugh it off, and in this case I was gonna make her feel like ""oh shit what have I gotten myself into"" and then laugh at her stupidity. it's even scientifically proven that if you laugh or smile while mad, you will get less mad",lolbro911,t2_2m951qwr,0.97,2306,176

386,jukcol,2020-11-15,teenagers,I made an old man cry at work today.,"This is kind of a big story, so let me start basic.  


I work at Kmart in a store in Australia, and our stores (dunno about other ones) have kiosks where you can upload photos from your phone and have them printed at the service desk. Anyway, I was working at the service desk today, scanning people's returns and trying to get through the busy Sunday shift. I hadn't noticed yet but standing in the que was a somewhat tall, a little hunched over old man with glasses that looked more like swimming goggles. It had been a busy and stressful day so far, so I was focusing on the task and didn't notice him yet.

I finished serving the customer and he walked up to me, very shyly.  
""Excuse me young man,"" he started, trying to gently get his old Iphone out of his pocket, ""could you please help me with the photo machines? I'm not very good with technology.""  
My first reaction was *""oh real clich√©, an old guy who needs tech help goes straight to the 16 year old.""* Luckily however, I made the decision to leave the rest of the people in the que for my workmates to serve, whilst I helped the customer.

We get to the kiosks and I immediately see the problem. He pulls his Iphone 4 out and he is starts to put his password in whilst holding the phone upside down.  
*This guy doesn't need help. He needs someone to do this for him,* I thought, as he passed me his phone which is opened to his emails.  
""Can you please print that photo?"" He says, as I look at what he has. It was a beautiful shot of some army-looking jets on a runway, with a symbol in the sunset and the caption *""1970-1989""* underneath. It was a stunning photo really, but trying to print it over emails would mean that the quality would be really poor. I told him that and he kept going ""Oh, that's alright.""

So I hooked up his phone, went through the options like sizing, glossy finished and whatnot. I asked him what he wanted, but he never gave me straight answers. ""Oh, if that's okay"" he always said. We settle with 3 custom prints of the planes.

But as I was scrolling through the options (I'm no expert at the photo kiosks) I accidentally pressed something and I see all 15 images he has on camera roll. A few of a small dog, quite a lot of someone's thumb, but there's about 7 images of a woman in there, taken August in 2019.

The woman looks about 80 like the old guy, she was much wider and larger that the guy and all the shots were of her sitting on a leather couch with several medals on the chest of her pink shirt. She looked quite unwell but she smiled in the photos.

Anyway, I think nothing of it and complete his purchase. That's the first time ever I have done someone's entire order for them.

We go back to the desk and I warn him that since the photo were saved through an email, the print quality might be a bit bad.  
""That's fine,"" he says, patiently holding his order slip. He payed the $3 and then said something all old people say like ""Oh you're help is worth more than that."" I can tell he is extremely thankful for my help and it makes me feel a little better as well.

One of the photos finish so I handed him one so he can look. And to no surprise, **the printing job looked terrible**, it was really low quality because of how emails compress image files.

I turned away and began putting his other two in a folder, somewhat disappointed in myself for how shit the photo quality was, before I turned and looked at him.  
He was staring at the sample I gave him, with his glasses on the bench and his face turned red. He wiped his eyes and sniffled, his gaze never lifting.  
""It's beautiful,"" he says, still locking eyes with the print.

Then he looks directly at me. His eyes are completely red and glistening in what I can only assume is happiness. I hand him his other two prints in the folder and I try to say ""That's everything"" or ""Thank you"" but my voice is lost. Personally, I am a very emotionally controlled person, but seeing this old person react like this broke me.

His voice was still cracking as he took the prints and began to walk away. I was lost for words, and then I found that my own vision was blurred. Continuously thanking me, and getting increasingly louder, he turned and broke into a burst of tears, walking away and holding the photo in front of him as he left my sight.

I was frozen solid, still processing what had just happened. Then it hit me. The photo of the old lady on his phone who was wearing the medals, had been taken over a year ago. The man had come in alone, quiet and shy with his only goal to print the photo of the jets in the sunset with the *""1970-1989""* caption. 

I might have just printed a memory of his wife.

End story.

Notes: I still have no idea whether that last part is true or not, but I can't stop thinking about how that all happened. If I wasn't there at the service desk when he was, if I hadn't of decided to help him order the photos, if I had just ignored him and told him that someone else would help him, would he have ever gotten those images of the planes?

I made a choice today: *Spend my time and effort to help this guy* or not.  
My whole life I have never felt like my choices or actions had ever affected anyone before. But I came home from work today completely silent, still thinking about how different that old guy's afternoon could have been if I had made the wrong choice.  
So I ask you, to make the right choices every day, because you have no idea how they are gonna affect other people.

446,279xdm,2014-06-04,MensRights,Why as I woman I agree with MRAs,"I am not going to say why I ""need"" MRAs - I am not a victim, I don't need anything but I can decide what I agree with and this subreddit has give me lots of material to work with.

I will make a list, those who are popular on tumblr, so any person who might be against MRAs pops in here can see why MRAs are not evil and that I am not a feminist who lost her tracks.

Feel free to add or correct. This is a list that explains why MRAs benefit everyone... I know a list of ""not everyone is like that"" will follow and I believe it is because even inside a movement nobody will ever agree or follow EVERYTHING. These are just some things I've noticed and MRAs allowed my thoughts to come to surface instead of labelling me as misogynyst. 

Before labelling me as misogynyst, stupid, racist, whatever let's discuss. Labels do nothing.

I support MRAs because...

- we don't have to race to which gender has it worse. We both have our issues and censorship and death threats to Men's Conferences are not a civil way of communicating.

- as a woman I don't want to be discriminated on workplace. Women, nowadays, sue for everything - from dirty jokes to being fired because they have power to do so. I don't want a company to be afraid of hiring me because I can destroy them with a sexual harrassment cause.

- for this same reason I don't want companies to be targeted by gold diggers who file a lawsuit because they were fired - I understand that everyone does their own business, but the level of selfishness and greediness is too much sometimes.

- women have to stop using kids to blackmail fathers.

- women have too much power in court when it comes to kids and divorces. Women's power over children is the reason why I am here, too many of them are allowed and not punished when doing their own selfish business at the expense of the whole family.

- divorced women with too much power over dads have led to awful childhoods with no option for the dad to help because he'd be in legal trouble if he did.

- joint parenthood means both parents can concentrate on children, jobs and themselves. That means both being breadwinners and houseparent.

- I do not want my future son to be trapped into paying for a child until he is 18 just because a woman he went to bed with lied about taking sexual contraceptives. I want men to have a say in sexual reproduction and not just be told to keep his wiener inside his pants. I trust that a man will take a daily pill if it's made available.

- I do not want to be treated as a child. That's what most feminist movements do. I can decide for myself what to believe and who to support. I've never been as respected for my beliefs as I am here, with MRA supporters.

- affirmative action removes bread from mouths of people who deserve it.

- I DO have responsabilities and I want to face them. I am responsible for my happiness and I don't need to blame men for everything that is wrong in the world, in history or in my life.

- to me equality does not mean simply looking at what is best in another group and claiming it as unconstitutional if I don't have the same rights. I do not expect more women to have affirmative actions to enter ""clean/not risky"" jobs while the number of male garbage collectors remains the same. Same goes with working/being a house mom - you have the choice and so should you SO.

- I want dangerous women to be properly punished by the law and consequently re-educated. Punishments do not have to be softer or non-existent because the accused person is a woman.

- I don't want my future son to be demonized for his sexual desires.

- I want my future son to pursue the career of his dreams - be it engineer, nurse or housedad, without being forced to be the breadwinner and accepting a job he likes less and that puts his health to risk.

- I don't want my future son to be blamed for (perceived) unequal pay but expected to pay for dates and all sorts of leisures.

- both my future's son and daughter lives will be equally important and a crime against one will not be more important than the other. 

- I am personally tired of women caring about their looks more than anyone else and blaming the rest of the world for being unhappy about them or when they are not held on pedestals for their beauty. Some women are appreciated by more men and some by less, it's called beauty and blaming others as ""vain"" for not appreciating your looks is vain and bitter... especially when you'd never date someone who earns less than you.

- women feel entitled to males' attention and demonize them when it's not given to them. When a woman chases a man and he doesn't return attraction he's labelled gay. When a man prefers a body type over another he's ""not a real man"" (especially when he doesn't like extra weight). But god forbid a woman date someone who has lower education or earns less than her.

- women should follow the same rules men do. If a job training requires hazing  or extra hours then we should not try to bend the rules for us.

- I don't want my future daughter to embrace victimhood but to raise her sleeves and works towards her success and help her family succeed as well.

- women have to be held responsible for the problems they cause through sexuality and their sexual power to the other gender. If a woman uses sex to bribe someone then both should be punished, not just the person taking advantage of sex. 

- I am not owed anything for V day unless we make BJ&stake day a national recurrence.

- women can be as guilty as men in all areas of life.

- women have to stop encouraging men to be violent then blaming them for it.

- I don't want men in my life to suffer because they are afraid to speak up and ask for help since everytime they ask all they get is a cold shoulder or a rant about men having privilege and power.

- there are dress codes and everyone is supposed to respect them. Dressing as if you are flaunting your sexuality at school or work (unless it's required) is not a synonim of freedom. In some places if you dress showing your sexual attributes you will not be taken seriously just like a man dressed in a tight spandew suit wouldn't be, so don't blame men because they can't keep their hormones straight. It's not about sex, it's about image. Dress however you like when you vlog or go clubbing, but keep it classy when you are in otherplaces where you have to follow a dress etiquette.

When men's problems involve not being listened to, being disposable and women having too much power we all suffer from it. ",DianaDewAsmr,t2_btbe1,0.89,533,210
447,ppkfjn,2021-09-16,MensRights,I was sexually harassed by a woman at work. I reported her to her male superior and I was crucified.,"I was hired to work in a profession where more men are needed, simply because many women do not want to do some of the work involved.

My immediate boss was a pushy woman who did not understand the concept of boundaries. For example, she made telephone calls at all hours. I immediately make friends and one of the people I got very friendly with was a woman - we totally had no romantic interest in each other - and she acted more like a drinking buddy.

For some reason my boss did not like to see this friendship. For example every day, I had lunch with my female friend. But my boss warned both me and her that we were spending too much time together and I needed to spend time with people who were more knowledgeable in the work we were doing.

My boss started to call me over to her office on the pretense of explaining something or asking about progress on some project I was working on but she started flirting a lot and this involved her putting her hand on my thigh, near my crotch. Her language was also vulgar and amongst other things she made 'jokes' like asking me what size shoes I wore because according to her penis size is related to shoe size.

I sent her an email, copied in to our male, gay manager, outlining her behaviour and why I thought it was inappropriate.

I was horrified when I was fired but doubly so when she reported me to the police for lying about her and tarnishing her reputation! Incredibly the police are taking action against me.

Edit: Please understand that I cannot give more detailed information such as location etc. Others are asking me questions like what can the police do... etc. But I would rather not reply publicly as it might compromise my position and my future course of action. I thank you all for your support.

Edit 2: I thank you for the support you are giving me. I am not in the USA and while I find some of the comments really helpful I cannot give more detailed information as it may easily identify me. ",zogins,t2_3ngbcdr3,0.95,2493,236
451,11asgcb,2023-02-24,MensRights,Women need to be called out on their hypocritical use of sexuality in the workplace,"Why does nobody has the balls to call this out?!

Women use their sexuality in work and work related settings ALL THE TIME. When they want a favor from a coworker, when they need help, when they are looking for a raise or promotion, when they are trying to get a new client/customer.

I had several dates with highly successful beautiful business women and they all laughingly admit of flirting and leading coworkers or clients/customers on in order to get that sale, promotion or just get it ""their way"". Had a date where the female CEO said if the client is a man, she sends one of her hot employees, always. And i myself -of course- over the years first hand have seen women get all girly and sexy, start using their cute girly voice when they need a favor or whatever. Its so blatant and normal, everyone knows it.

Yet women flip the fuck out when a man tries to be flirty or tries to use sexuality in their favor. They act like its an  unthinkable immoral crime that needs to be punished. If you ask women if sexuality belongs in the workplace, they all say ABSOLUTELY NOT. Yet they use it every single fucking day. Hell women told me they dress sexier for clients when they want to get a deal/sale. They flirt, they drop sexual suggestions only to later shoot the man they led on down. This all would be fine...if they weren't hypocrites that literally try to cancle and destroy men who dare to flirt back or god forbid initiate a flirt.

Coworker or customer flirts with woman at work = Oh god look at that creepy piece of shit. He should be reported and fired, this doesn't belong in the workplace.

Last Saturday at around 1:30 PM, because of the long weekend, Disney Springs in Walt Disney World in Florida was very busy.  And as it often happens in crowded places there was a line for the ladies room and almost none to the men's room. 

The particular restroom was located at the World of Disney store.  The men's room was busy, all the urinals were occupied but two toilet stalls were open.  I went into a stall and was doing my business.  I heard the door open and someone announced: ""woman coming in"".  I have seen this happen before when a female custodian comes in to the men's room to clean.

This woman walks directly to an open stall.  She announces ""I am not waiting in that line.""  Followed by ""Y'all don't have anything I haven't seen before"".  

After she finishes her business, she walks over to the sink again announcing ""Y'all don't have anything I haven't seen before"", washes her hands and then walks out.  All the men in there kinda looked at each other like ""what just happened here""?

This woman not only disrespected every man that was in the men's room at that time, she also disrespected every woman waiting in line.  Worst of all, she got away with it.

Today while I was changing, the staff walked through with a woman among them in the middle of the day! No announcement, not call for it anyone was changing, just walked right through. I had to cover my privates and body!

I asked what the hell was up and they said she was the district manager? Like that's makes a difference???

If that happened in the women's they'd be getting sued, right? Like what the fuck do I do about this?

Update:

Had a call with a vice president of HR for the gym chain. 

They recognized my complaint as a serious breach of my privacy, stating that they make efforts to put up signs that a woman would be entering the locker room area and announced to say when she was (I had my headphones In and apparently didn't hear this). 

They sighted that the gym staff should have inspected and talked to all who were in the locker room and alerted us personally, however they take the same policy with the women's. Not sure if I believe that... Especially since she entered the women's on her own. 

The district manager and several other members of staff are being reprimanded/suspended for this.

I did not seek compensation, but also let them know that I had alerted the local news to this issue and would no long be attending their gym due to this. If anything comes of that I'll update with a YouTube link. 

I'm sure many will have criticism for how else I should have handled this, but I am happy with getting the company to admit a fault and that there will be consequences for this ignorance.

467,6uumes,2017-08-20,MensRights,Fuck office politics: newly arrived female coworker is in difficulty with her work and is attacking my reputation behind my back. WTF???,"The reason I post here is because many of the things this coworker does she can get away with it because she's a woman, and she's blatantly using female shaming tactics (people may not agree with the fact these are female tactics, but I think they are), *in the workplace*, to get her way...

She had a task: do her job and learn ho to do new things. Me (and others) supported her. After a few months I no longer had the obligation to support her and I realized she was slacking on purpose (facebook, amazon, chats, etc, instead of working). She... didn't like that. Because she had decided *not* to learn anything, when push came to shove and she needed to deliver, she went mad and started using the only coin at her disposal to fight the situation: social group, gossip, men-hating.

She started attacking me behind my back, trying to ruin my reputation. Her reasoning was that our boss was pressuring her to deliver, she didn't know how to do the job (spent months without applying herself) and because I was capable of doing it, *I had to drop everything for her*.

To quote her (a coworker showed me this):

- ""why doesn't Demian do it instead of me? He's the only one who knows how to do it anyway..."".
- ""I'm stuck with this, the *client* is an asshole, it's not clear what I have to do... of course it would be a lot easier if Demian supported me, but he never helps me...""
- ""this job is shit, can't do it... talk to me about your weekend :)""
- ""I asked X to give me a hand, I'm waiting for him. I watched this cool movie last night...""

Again and again, complaints in private to her friend (one of the PMs) in order to get someone to tell me to do the job *for her*. Never mentioning how she was told, when hired, that *she needed to learn this stuff*! Only implying how she's willing to do the job but my lack of support is blocking her (false and shameless accusation)...

She decided by herself that team work meant she was excempted from every responsibility. This is an example of a chat conversation:

- SHE: demian, you are not busy, right? :)
- ME: I'm busy, sorry.
- SHE: eh... you are doing research... can't you help me with this?
- ME: sorry, but I can't help you. Try to take it slowly and face one problem at a time, you'll get there.
- SHE: but I need someone to show me how it's done...
- ME: and I sent you lots of material months ago, I can't do the job for you..

She grabbed the last message and send it to four different women and a guy so they could support her in bashing me.

I had to protect myself after that. I intervened with certain coworkers and made sure my version was known. After a few days, she made so much noise and her work was so behind that my boss asked me my opinion on her and her work. 

Because of what she did (the chat convo was just one occurrence of her gossip), I sunk her in front of my boss. I spent almost 8 months without saying anything negative about a coworker (her!) in order to avoid putting her in a difficult spot, and what does she does?

She targets me because I don't go over mountains for her (where does the entitlement come from lol????) and decides to fuck with my reputation, just because she was lazy and had to choose between admitting her lack of knowledge to my bosses (damage to her image) or use social games to blame *me* instead (damage to *my* image)...

-------

Right now, I was promoted and next month I'll be in charge of her work. At the moment, she latched onto another coworker, constantly ""asking"" him how to do things, constantly ""asking"" him to look up stuff for her by saying ""she doesn't know how to do the job..."", and implying he has to because of ""team work""...

While the guy looks for stuff up, she opens her chat or facebook and starts doing random stuff or talking with her friends, waiting for him. And the spineless guy refuses to say ""no"" to her, is depressed and overloaded of work all day, and earns even less than she does...

And by the way, whenever the guy can't cope with it anymore and snaps at her, she starts gossiping behind his back telling everyone how this guy is having his ""ladies days""...

The three of us were on the same role inside the company, but unlike us, who focused on the job, she focused on her relationship with the others. At first I thought this wouldn't be an issue because we are all different, until she started using that ""support group"" she formed to backup her up on her lack of skills and all her BS...

Fucking office politics. And fuck women who blatantly push to establish social bonds with other women and then use gossip to get their way against men who actually work and don't give a crap about this stuff...",demian78,t2_ax22xax,0.89,937,219

But today was a different story. 

I recently joined a sort of bonus program offered by the nursing college that allows us to get a little extra experience by joining a group that goes to the local hospital and shadows nurses doing their daily routine. I'm the only male in the group, and before this had never been a problem. Today we were going to the birthing suits to shadow the OB nurses there. Now I got to watch ultrasounds, infant care, etc no problems, but while we were there a mother went into labor and consented to us observing the child being born.

We're about to go into the room when one of our ""tour guides"", for lack of a better term, pulls me aside and says ""I think you should sit this one out, the mother might be uncomfortable with a man in the room viewing this."" I was floored by this. I pretty much assumed that when the mother in question consented they told her that there was a male student there as well. I responded with ""Well do you mind if I at least ASK the woman if I can come in? I'd rather not miss something like this."" To which she replied ""Listen, you'll be going over this when you're in training, I think it's best if you stay outside, this sort of thing requires a more feminine touch.""

At this point it's all I can do to stop from yelling at this woman. I told her, as calmly as I could, that would inform her supervisors if she didn't at least let me ask if the mother would permit me to view the birth. She visibly pissed at this but let me go in and ask, and the mother told me she was perfectly fine with me being in there (her actual words were ""Hell, bring a camera if you want,"" which calmed me down a bit). After we finished for the day I called the programs administration office and filed the complaint anyway. I also took the liberty of warning the few other male nursing students I know to watch out for the lady.

I can honestly say that this was the first time in my life I've ever felt discrimination on anything, let alone because of the fact that some of my organs dangle. I just kept asking myself if it would get worse than this. It may sound mild but I was extremely offended by this and I felt it necessary to share.

A patriarchy where men have to pay a woman after divorce even if the woman is a working one. And wait for it, if the man gets a promotion at work, the alimony increases in some countries. 

A patriarchy where a man has little to no rights over his own child because of gender biased family court laws.

A patriarchy where the guy is most likely to get fucked if the woman merely accuses his family of wrongdoing in a marriage, his whole family can get jailed.

I‚Äôve been thinking about it for a while‚Ä¶I am now a Men‚Äôs Rights Advocate.,"I‚Äôm posting this from a throwaway that I don‚Äôt plan on using much, if at all. I need to do so because I‚Äôve worked in Democratic Party politics (and have career goals working for the party), and there are plenty of factions within the party that are still hostile to the MRM. I don‚Äôt want my name slandered, and I don‚Äôt want to be called a misogynist simply because some men and women disapprove of my stance toward the MRM.

Let me start off by saying that I used to be a feminist in high school. I went to protests, spoke to other young men about feminism, and smugly preached about equality from my moral pedestal. 

I went to a pretty good college with a multitude of women studying the liberal arts. I need to mention this because I‚Äôve had quite a few classmates who will one day become leaders of the feminist movement (authors, organization leaders, etc.). Rest assured that their radical views and sexist opinions against men made me disown my feminist label.

I‚Äôve always liked this forum for its discussion, but I would never have called myself an MRA, even on the Internet. Last Friday changed that for me, and I‚Äôm thankful for it. I never thought that I would be accused of assault, and I never thought that a woman could get away with assaulting a man in front of others. I've had a friend falsely accused of rape i ncollege, but I thought to myself, ""Hey, it's not me. None of my business."" I was always afraid of the MRA label because of what others might say about me. 

What happened to me?

I was at a bar on Friday when another guy bumped into me. I apologized, but the dude was looking for a fight. He grabbed my collar and pushed me back. I got in his face (I know, immature, but I couldn‚Äôt let him push me around). I asked that he drop the issue and we go on our own paths. He insists on stirring the pot.

He really wants to fight. I push him back and try to get a bouncer. As I‚Äôm moving back, the girl he‚Äôs with pushes me, slaps me, and then dumps her drink on me. 

When I tell him to back the both of them up‚Ä¶she grabs me and hits me again.

Now the entire bar is looking at me while I‚Äôm getting hit by this girl. She knows I cant, and won‚Äôt, defend myself. Every man and woman in the room is looking at me and not helping. 

The bouncers break her of me.

‚Ä¶and they kick me, not her, out of the bar. 

Why? The bouncers, who, to their credit, acted very courteously, explained that the female bartender said that I, the guy, had to have started it. In her opinion, the bouncers stated, there‚Äôs no way the girl, a few inches shorter than me, would aggressively attack a man. The bouncers were going to call the police because I allegedly attacked a woman. 

I had the opportunity explain my side of the story to the bouncers, who then corroborated it with the camera footage of the bar. The cameras saved me. If they weren‚Äôt there, I would have been banned from the bar and arrested for assault, as the girl wanted to call the police
--
Even if the story didn‚Äôt entertain you, I just wanted to say thank you for this forum. 

If I ever make it far in Democratic Party politics, you‚Äôll have an MRA speaking to the leaders of the party. We still need to promote our dialogue and conversations to the national profile. We need to change the narrative surrounding men and assault. We can‚Äôt let people get away with promoting the idea of male privilege while men can be falsely accused so easily. 

I‚Äôm in a hurry, so I have to go. I‚Äôm just another guy who has joined the MRM today. Keep up the good work. 

EDIT: I came back just to answer two questions I'm seeing constantly repeated below:

1. There is videotape, and yes, the girl and her party were thrown out of the bar.

2. I'm not going to press charges. Why? 1. We were in an establishment that sells alcohol, so authorities might think it's two drunken people acting stupid 2. Let's all be honest here, if I wanted to knock out the girl and the rest of her guy friends, I could have done it. I'm literally a trained fighter. And because of that, I have a feeling it would get used against me in court. 3. Guys, if this ever hit the media, and even if I am proven innocent and the charges stick (which the 100% would), don't you think ANY political party would use this as ammunition? I've worked in media--powerful media outlets have a narrative. Man defending himself from women does NOT fall within the narrative. 

Apologies for the grammar and typos. I'm on my way home from work.

1. Men suicide 4x more then woman. One dude i know already lost 3 of his M friends to suicide!!! And personally I have lost my brother to suicide when he was 23.
2. 2.Men are pretty much almost twice as susceptible to end up abusing drugs/alcohol (\~6% vs \~12% for men).
3. 70% of homeless people are men.
4. Men have 10x + chance to die in the workplace.
5. Men have next to no social support and networks compared to woman.
6. Men are 2.5x more likely to develop videogame addiction (probably because real life sucks more for them I know that its a good way to avoid having to deal with reality)
7. Men don't do as well in school at least not with the modern system and woman are more present in higher education programs and obtain more diplomas then men.
8. It is way harder for men to find a partner( IMO especially since the rise of dating websites and social medias). I think a good proof is there's way less women using dating apps then there are men, i assume simply out of a lack of necessity in the first place.
9. Pretty sure woman live on average 8 years longer then men, because life is fair like that lol.
10. Young woman nowadays earn more money then young men meanwhile young men are still most of the time expected to provide for their families and even be a bigger earner then his female partner. Not even going to get into dating/romantic stuff (early relationship / dating life).
11. When shit goes down for your country youre more likely to be forcefully enrolled in the army. and when shit goes down in any other situation you're almost expected to be brave and know how to fight and even defend other people, or just having to resolve things by violence when dealing with other men.
12. Getting fucked over in court and losing custody unless something is terribly wrong with the mother.
13. How modern tv/ads/movies (hollywood in particular) has recently started to make men look stupid, foolish and inferior, there is almost no inspirational roles portraying strong male characters anymore, now its only strong female characters and they're hella overpowered, they make sure the audience knows without a doubt that they're doing everything better then men.
14. I don't care if its a small minority or if they have been lucky with good genetics, young woman can use onlyfans if they are willing and they can earn way more in their 20's alone then a doctor or any other top tier job man ever could in his entire life. Meanwhile I also have good genetics and I am young but if I did the same I wouldn't even be able to afford a bag of chips a month with my earnings i bet...  You will say, well woman with good genetics go to modeling and pornography, and men with good genetics go to sports... But I'm pretty sure it's quite a bit harder to become a pro NFL player or something then it is to strip naked on onlyfans or show some cleavage on twitch while licking a plastic ear and moaning.
15. Woman have WAY higher standards in general and specifically on dating apps/websites where they will swipe a guy positively a lot less often then a man will swipe a woman positively, which means the competition to find a partner is astonishingly harder as the average man. Not even close. I've even heard 2% swipe rate meanwhile men swipe HARD. I don't really want to discuss men swipe rate because I've heard that a lot of them will literally swipe all the girls, not that this is a pro-male argument anyways lol, it means theyre literally so desperate...

570,9ne96o,2018-10-11,MensRights,"It is now males, rather than females, who suffer the vast majority of institutional discrimination","I don't believe that males have ever been [privileged](https://www.amazon.ca/Privileged-Sex-Martin-van-Creveld/dp/1484983122) in the way feminists claim.   But we are now at the point where the deck is stacked against males at every stage of their lives and in almost every major institution.   

When a male is born he can have his genitals mutilated. Hundreds of baby boys die from this procedure every year.

Then comes primary school, where boys are often punished and even drugged for displaying natural boyish behavior. Recent studies have also revealed that female teachers mark down boys by an average of 20 percent for the same work.

Huge numbers of boys are now being raised without fathers (including about 99 percent of school shooters, funny how we never talk about that), and since pedo hysteria has chased male teachers out of primary school, boys often don't have any male role models until much later in life.

Boys only clubs (eg the Boy Scouts) are being eliminated while girl only clubs remain.

Teenage boys are being introduced to blatantly misandrist concepts like ""toxic masculinity,"" with narry a word about toxic femininity and nothing about the positive aspects of masculinity.

Next it's off to University, where there are a range of female-specific scholarships and programs even though women make up the majority of college students and young women are now out-earning young men. They are also portrayed as rapists in waiting, and there are entire departments (gender studies) devoted to demonizing their sex. If a young man pisses off a young woman (eg dumps her after a one night stand) he faces the possibility of being subjected to a false accusation and a feminist Kangaroo court. Then it's bye bye academic career and social reputation.

If he wants to vote he will have to sign over his body to the state (selective service).

If he gets a woman pregnant he will not have the option of legal parental surrender. While a woman can just drop off the baby at a safe haven, the man is on the hook for 18 years of child support and will be locked up if he loses his job and can't pay.

In the workplace things are just as bad. Men perform almost all of the dirty and dangerous jobs and make up 95 percent of workplace injuries and deaths. If a white man wants to pursue a more respected career he faces racial and sexual discrimination in hiring due to corporate ""diversity"" measures and quotas. A recent study in...I think it was Australia found that ""blind hiring"" practices (where the employer doesn't know the race or sex of the applicant) result in more straight white males being hired; this means that it is straight white men who are now suffering discrimination in the workplace.

With MeToo, a man can be fired from his job simply for making a woman uncomfortable. There have even been cases of men being fired for telling a naughty joke.

If he gets married and the wife divorces him through no fault of his own he will likely be treated like shit by the family courts unless he can afford a high priced lawyer. There are countless stories of men effectively being turned into indentured servants by their ex-wives; they live in poverty and seldom see their kids while the wife gets a new ""baby daddy"" and lives high on the hog. NOW, the largest feminist organization in the world, continues to oppose shared parenting even though every single study shows it to be in the best interests of the children, the father and even the mother.

He will receive less social support, less health care spending, and be relentlessly demonized in the media. 

If a male is sexually assaulted by a woman he will probably not receive justice; the perp will likely get a slap on the wrist even if the victim is a boy.  

If he commits a crime or is falsely accused of a crime he will be treated much, much more harshly by the criminal justice system.

I could go on.

It is a myth that feminists think the sexes are equal. Their MO goes like this: if men are ahead in some area, that means women are being oppressed because the sexes are identical except for genitalia; however, if women are ahead in some area that's because women are superior. You can find this sentiment going back to the first wave. Elizabeth Cady Stanton claimed that women are ""infinitely superior"" to men.

The prison thing is perhaps the most glaring example of feminists not practicing what they preach. If they were serious about equality they would be demanding either that men be treated with more compassion/leniency or that women be treated more harshly (or some combination of the two). Instead, they want women to be treated even *more* leniently, and some are even advocating for the complete abolition of female prisons.

Men are increasingly second class citizens not only in a social but legal sense. A study in the UK determined that if women were treated like men by the criminal justice system, fully half of all prisoners would be female. Women do NOT commit less crimes than men (though they do commit less homicides), they just don't get punished to anywhere near the same extent.

If feminism were an ""equality"" movement they would not be trying to privilege females in every single institution.    They would be looking with a keen eye at areas in which males are disadvantaged and/or subject to institutional discrimination.   They certainly wouldn't blame everything on some nebulous all-encompassing ""patriarchy"" that hasn't even been proven to exist.  

Advocates of gender equality must reject feminism, and support men's rights.  ",Vwar,t2_15qoa077,0.86,2555,252
576,oivkws,2021-07-12,MensRights,In Portugal the quality of the Covid vaccine you get depends on your gender.,"The vaccination of people under 50 against Covid-19 in Portugal created a massive gender divide in the whole vaccination process. Portugal announced that men in the 18-50 age group [would be getting the J&J (Janssen) vaccine while women would get only Pfizer and Moderna vaccines](https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2021-06-13/janssen-vaccine-now-recommended-for-men-over-18/60385). Astrazeneca vaccine is not given to that age group regardless of gender.

For those not acquainted with the different Covid vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have a [95%](https://www.janssencovid19vaccine.com/hcp/clinical-data.html) and [94.1%](https://www.janssencovid19vaccine.com/hcp/clinical-data.html) effectiveness respectively and nearly 100% effectiveness at preventing death or serious illness. Janssen vaccine on the other hand has [66% effectiveness in preventing moderate to severe disease.](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/01/29/961887796/johnson-johnson-vaccine-is-66-effective-in-preventing-moderate-to-severe-covid-1) The excuse given for the gender segregation was that most cases of blood clots from Janssen vaccine occurred in women. However the truth is cases were extremely rare on both genders and the European Medicines Agency has recommended it for both genders within that age group. Portugal chose not to follow that recommendation.

It gets worse, however. Currently [90% of infections](https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2021-07-07/delta-variant-responsible-for-close-to-90-percent-of-infections-in-the-country/60905) in Portugal come from the Delta variant. While Pfizer and Moderna vaccines (and most two-dose vaccines) have been proven to have [very high efficacy](https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-variant-covid-vaccine-effectiveness-protection-pfizer-moderna-astrazeneca-2021-7) against this variant, Janssen vaccine is thought to have little to no efficacy against it, similar to single shots of the remaining vaccines. This is concerning to the point that in the US [there are already Pfizer/Moderna booster shots being administered](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/booster-may-be-needed-jj-shot-delta-variant-spreads-some-experts-already-taking-2021-06-25/) to people who took the Janssen vaccine due to the Delta variant. Men in Portugal are being given a vaccine that offers little to no protection to the variant we have, and the government is aware of that.

Officially men in Portugal **can** be given the Janssen vaccine, but there is no official ""men get this, women get that"" rule. However such rule remains in practice in vaccination centers nonetheless.

Today I went to have my vaccine. I asked which one they were giving and of course it was Janssen. I asked whether they could give any of the others as this was the only vaccine I wasn't comfortable in getting.  Staff consulted with each other (all female staff) and afterwards with the nurse and claimed it was impossible, that they only had Janssen vaccine. This is of course a lie since there were plenty of women in my age group getting the vaccine there and currently women in this age group **cannot** be given Janssen vaccine at all unless they volunteer themselves. This means a vaccination centre that is accepting women cannot have the Janssen vaccine exclusively. In other words their response shows a de facto rule that men are given only Janssen vaccine is being enforced.

Quoting the official announcement, ***""this single-dose vaccine may also be administered to women aged 50 years or below ""who wish to do so, if duly informed, on a basis of weighing the benefits and risks"", provided they express their ""free and informed consent"".*** Once again, ""free and informed consent"" is a right men do not have as is the case in many other matters.

This comes added to the fact that men are very disproportionately killed by Covid-19, with a current mortality of 2.1% (9.016 deaths among 415.709 infected) compared to women's 1.6% mortality (8.148 deaths among 493.506 infected). It's no surprise that men are considered disposable in Portugal as is usually the rule everywhere else. In fact, when the number of workplace accidents went from 78% male to 69% male the national worker's union (CGTP) presented it as an ""aggravation of the gender inequality in work accidents"" [(Source in Portuguese)](http://www.cgtp.pt/images/images/2016/02/tendenciaacident.pdf), since male lives don't really matter.

Take part in a programme called 'Inspiring Girls' providing 100 girls across the city with a unique insight into business and higher education. Why? Because privilege? Or just because boys are a waste of space (/S)? What?,"Article from *The Guardian* Friday 03 February 2017:

>**Schools can raise girls' aspirations by partnering with businesses**

>*Students from disadvantaged backgrounds aren‚Äôt always aware of the opportunities open to them. We‚Äôre working to change this.*

>The absence of aspiration and understanding of opportunities that I see in some students from disadvantaged backgrounds ‚Äì especially girls ‚Äì is something I want to address directly. I believe the answer to the lack of female leaders within our society and businesses could partly lie with us in education, and we have found partnerships with the business community leads to stronger results.

Personally, I generally support moves that attempt to address widening social inequalities and attainment gaps in British society - and the idea of taking high school kids from disadvantaged backgrounds and showing them the kind of jobs that are not out of their reach and that they could one day actually do, does seem like one very good way of addressing that problem.

But as with any intervention, I would personally want to be sure that the problem has been correctly diagnosed before administering the solution.

So I was a tad dismayed to see this next paragraph:

>At both our academies, Whalley Range high school and Levenshulme high school for girls, we have been lucky enough to be involved in [the Inspiring Girls programme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNj4KfXQ3mg) ‚Äì part of a Business in the Community initiative with Alliance Manchester Business School. Almost 100 young women from six high schools across Manchester have graduated from the programme this year. [We were particularly keen to get involved because it was an initiative that focused its efforts on encouraging girls of secondary school age to prepare for their futures](http://archive.is/PPISc).

Both those schools - Whalley Range high school and Levenshulme high school - are all girls schools only although whether that means the other four schools in the programme are all girls schools as well is not mentioned. If all six participating schools *are* in fact for girls schools only then that would seem to discriminate against girls in the area attending mixed high schools as well as - obviously - any boys.

And of course there are girls from disadvantaged backgrounds and those girls should absolutely be encouraged to perceive their futures as containing a far-wider range of options than they might currently believe they have access to.

But why does this programme seem to be exclusively aimed at girls in Manchester and North West of the UK? Why is a similar programme also running in [London](https://itfinspiringwomen.wordpress.com) and [other parts of the UK](https://vimeo.com/83024771) that, again, only focusses on girls? 

Why, in particular, is this programme only addressing the needs of young women when the following is *also* true:

>* [**Poor white boys get 'a worse start in life' says equality report**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34667100/poor-white-boys-get-a-worse-start-in-life-says-equality-report)

>* [**... why are poor white boys falling behind?**](http://archive.is/klRNz)

That last headline actually comes from *The Guardian*, by the way. And then there's this from the *Times Education Supplement*:

>[**GCSE results: Gender gap widens as girls pull further ahead**](https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/gcse-results-gender-gap-widens-girls-pull-further-ahead)

That article notes that while the the overall gap of ""8.9 percentage points ‚Äì was wider than the 8.4 percentage points seen last summer and represents the biggest gulf since 2002, when girls were 9 percentage points ahead"" it also notes that:

> ... the gulf was narrower in the sciences with girls' results being only slightly better than boys in Physics (0.2 percentage points), Biology (1.6 percentage points), Chemistry (2.8 percentage points) and Computing (2.9 percentage points).

So even in STEM subjects - which we often hear things such as this - [Girls lack self-confidence in maths and science problems, study finds](http://archive.is/uFJt8) - girls are outperforming boys, even if only by a slender margin.

But despite all of that, that *Guardian* article from Friday 03 February 2017 continues:

>International Women‚Äôs Day in March last year marked the start of our year 9 students taking part. One of the activities included in the programme was a day of workshops hosted at the business school. The day allowed the girls to get an insight into university life, and life as a woman in business 

>[...] the students joined a range of optional workshops such as creative thinking, influencing people and personal branding, which were delivered by senior staff at the [Alliance Manchester Business School].

>[...] Just one day of mentoring was extremely valuable to my students, and allowed them to think and plan for the future. The girls were bubbling with enthusiasm throughout the day, which spilled over into their conversations back at school. The main things that seemed to surprised them was the amount of opportunities and the level of job satisfaction in the construction industry, as well as the fact that a number of the speakers had been the first in their family to go to university. The theme of working hard and with determination to achieve your dream was a prevalent one.

>Throughout the [Inspiring Girls] initiative I have seen a marked improvement in the students‚Äô approach to work and their confidence in and outside of the classroom.

Like I say, it's not that I think girls from disadvantaged backgrounds should not be given opportunities such as these but when we live in a period where girls have been outperforming boys for over a decade and where poor boys - from black and Asian as well as white backgrounds incidentally - are experiencing particularly high rates of failure and all of the negative consequences that proceed from that - it seems positively obscene not to set up similar programmes for them.

If there are in fact any such programmes aimed at boys, please do let me know.


**Edit^1** Minor corrections.

**Edit^2** From u/GuardHamster

> To answer your question, here is a quote about some of the programs helping out boys in the UK and US. Of course more can be done but the point is that the ball is rolling.
"" Seventy-seven British universities, or about 45 percent of the total, report that they have programs to support men and young boys in general, the national Office of Fair Access reports; 51 of them, to help working class and white, black, and ethnic minority low-income boys in particular.

So the idea that this is an impossible scenario is simply false.

There is simply no winning anymore. Now if you follow the Pence rule, you can be punished for that to.   Act friendly with a woman and ask her out or show interest, and you get punished or fired for harassment. Okay. Men adapt. Now, you act professional with a woman, and her and her friends get upset that this is a hostile work environment and want to report this to HR. If a man does A he gets in trouble. If he does B he gets in trouble. If he reverses course and does Z or Y he gets in trouble as well. If he says f the system it's all BS and goes MGTOW, then he gets labelled incel, misogynist, sexist.

It is promising however that pretty much everyone in the thread called OP out for her total BS, but the simple fact that a group of women would even think to do this is just insane. I suspect (this is just my opinion) that the man is attractive, she showed interest, he says no thanks let's talk about work, and she takes it personally and builds a *hostile work environment* in her mind because she can't fathom that someone doesn't want to be best buddies with her *at work* and just wants to be professional. More attention-seeking bullshit. Nobody is entitled to friendship to anyone, but somehow this is too much to comprehend for some people. Imagine being so fragile that someone not being your best friend makes you feel uncomfortable. It honestly seems to me that she and the other girls at the office are harassing him. Rules for thee but not for me. I shoot you for no reason, but I am the victim.

Imagine if a group of guys went to HR and said, ""we feel upset that a female coworker at the office won't talk with us"". They would be annihilated. This is just complete delusion. I don't know how any man can remain hopeful when bullshit like this keeps happening.",TheGrandScheme3,t2_4c47t793,0.96,510,142

624,y7jd5p,2022-10-18,MensRights,Hilarity of diversity hiring,"I work in a financial sector referred to as Private Equity (‚ÄúPE‚Äù), at a major global firm. 

I was tasked with recruiting for my city‚Äôs office this year for our junior Associates that start next year, which gave me great insight as to how much of an advantage a woman has in recruiting for a coveted spot at a prestigious firm.

First off, diversity recruiting has nothing to do with race anymore, only gender. There is almost no socioeconomic diversity amongst candidates anymore - they are all from affluent/wealthy families, all went to an 8 Schools boarding school or elite NYC prep school, all went to Harvard/Yale/Princeton/U Penn/Stanford/Columbia/Oxford, and all came from the same five elite investment banks. Point is, we aren‚Äôt changing any of these candidates lives in any meaningful way economically.

We had narrowed down 100 candidates to a pool of 25 candidates for 5 seats, and our target was 3 men and 2 women out of 20 men and 5 women. 

After we interviewed all of the candidates and reviewed their technical exam, we had an all hands call to discuss who we were going to give offers to. We said to cut down the bottom 25% of the technical exam (which had blind scoring) and then we would review the remaining candidates. When we looked through the list and picked the definite offers (4 guys really crushed it), we realized we had a problem, all of the women scored within the bottom 25% of the test. In fact, there was a LARGE gap between the top-scoring woman and the bottom-scoring man. 

We were then stuck on the call for an hour trying to figure out which woman would make the best to fill that one seat even though they all had a black ball against them from the in person interviews from being ill-prepared (from other women at the firm, not just my male colleagues). We had to overlook several well-qualified men to fill and seat with an unqualified woman, which just pisses me off.

How does anyone think this is the best way to get women in finance?",CurveArtistic,t2_971x9iks,0.96,616,192
625,126sljm,2023-03-30,MensRights,I legally changed my sex to woman,"Yep. I finally did it, I‚Äôm legally a woman now. There‚Äôs so many privileges and advantages you get in my country (Spain) for being a women that I was forced to go change my sex. The list of privileges women get in Spain is VAST, so it‚Äôs deffo worth it.

It was a very easy process, I just had to state I identified as a woman and would like to be considered - legally - as such. Took like 5 minutes.

Anyways, now I get to enjoy the extra privileges, rights and advantages of the ‚Äúopressed‚Äù.

A ton of people are asking me what privileges and extra rights are given to females in Spain and I‚Äôve tried responding to everyone but it‚Äôs just better to [add them here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/126sljm/i_legally_changed_my_sex_to_woman/jeavb82/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3)

642,odi2ma,2021-07-04,MensRights,"""Emotional labour"" is the term women use when they emotionally abuse men.","After reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/lums86/woman_realizes_shes_been_accidentally_abusing_her/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), I started thinking about the all too common story of the husband who has no self-confidence left. Reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ocxwrc/why_are_so_many_women_unaware_of_the_emotional/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), however, really set me off to writing this post.

""[Emotional labor](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/emotional-labor-in-the-workplace/202004/emotional-labor-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not) is the regulation of one‚Äôs feelings at one‚Äôs job."" Although, as acknowledged by the article linked, the meaning has been stretched to mean, ""[Women planning things.](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/)""

Both cases of ""emotional labour"" (and all other cases that include its stretched definition) have one thing in common: an abusive woman.

Picture this: You're a husband who works a job, and are trying to help around the house. Good for you, right? Except, before anything else, you'll be [berated](https://www.katykatikate.com/the-blog/2019/5/7/so-you-want-to-help-around-the-house) for not being a perfect mind-reading magician and doing so earlier. 

Then comes the fun part: Nothing you do will satisfy her. You'll be scolded and called ""incompetent"" for getting the tiniest of details wrong. You're not good enough, and you never will be. Not unless you read her mind perfectly, because she can't bother explaining things to you; she shouldn't have to.

Any confidence you had in yourself is gone, and you stop doing those things you wanted to; you always get them wrong, anyways. This is the real kicker: Now you'll be blamed for not doing enough. You're now a lazy bum, a manchild, a mama's boy. You depend on her for everything, and she can't take it, so she takes it out on you. ""I don't have to ask you to help! You should know already!"". That's the part that gets you. ""You should know already."" You should already know what she needs help doing. You should already be doing the thing. You should already know exactly how to do the thing, to the last detail. You should already know all that, and the only reason you don't is because you're not good enough.

But oh no, you're not the victim in all this; she is, because she's doing the ""emotional labour"". Stop thinking your feelings are valid; they're just a manifestation of your ""fragile male ego"" that ""needs constant appeasing"". She doesn't need to caress your ego. You need to be the man she needs you to be, because you're not good enough.",Hey_itsmeguys,t2_a3edilh8,0.86,1730,314
651,t8ot5r,2022-03-07,MensRights,Women who hug,"I met a woman the other day (it does happen). Someone I didn't know; someone I'm likely to be working with a lot in the next few weeks. I should preface my remarks with the fact that I hold this woman in very high regard; she's very skilled at her job and I was the decision-maker in hiring her. She's delightful company professionally; I barely know her personally. She's also conventionally very attractive and a good fifteen years my junior.

The first thing she did, on our first meeting after the interview, was approach me for a hug. I instinctively recoiled, and a look of some confusion and offence crossed her face. It was awkward. I hated doing it. But ""I don't do hugs,"" I explained. ""Not in this me-too world.""

She literally gaped at me in absolute astonishment.

Naturally, since this particular woman is, as far as I know, a completely reasonable and sane individual, her reaction was to start explaining that I was overreacting and she has *no* intention of taking any action against me, and it's probably true. The harder-line feminists of the world would probably lecture me on the idea that if I don't give her any reason to object then I won't suffer the consequences, but as I say, I don't know this woman personally. I don't know how easy she is to irritate. I don't know how angry she gets, how quickly, and [it is a material fact that women are more likely to exhibit negative emotion than men](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/sexual-personalities/201504/are-women-more-emotional-men).

But even if we assume they're right and it's rare - and it probably is - the problem with is, as we're all painfully aware, it's a huge risk to take. In many modern western countries, any woman has the arbitrary power to have any man arrested, publicly pilloried as a sex pest and permanently deny him a social life and a career, that is, to completely destroy his life, even if the case never goes to trial ([and sometimes they do](https://www.itv.com/news/london/2016-02-16/commuter-cleared-of-ludicrous-sex-assault-warns-the-same-could-happen-to-any-man); that example is rare only in that the guy was exonerated and received a lot of publicity; the woman, who was obviously lying, was not prosecuted).

Honestly, refusing this woman a hug was probably pointless in any case. If she even *claimed* I'd touched her in a way she didn't like, I'd be instantly arrested, even if I actually hadn't; I feel like I'm giving myself the best possible chance, but I have no real confidence in that.

Still, this is where we now are. This is the world in which we have to exist. This is what a minority of feminist activists wanted, and they got it. So, woman-I-just-hired, I apologise for what happened on Saturday, but it's because of the fact that every woman I meet is effectively a ticking time bomb capable of destroying my life for any reason, or none at all.",Huffers1010,t2_a0xsse2g,0.89,538,197
