Listen. If you are 16, there is basically zero reason for an adult man to approach you for a relationship. Zero. You will change astronomically in your teens and twenties - these are formative years in your life. The person you are today will be so significantly different from the person you will be this time next year. There is literally nothing you have in common with a grown ass man, unless that grown ass man is also mentally 16 years old (which, huge yikes). You are not mature for your age. Older women are not just ""jealous"" of you (I don't even know why that narrative is spun). There's a reason why these men can't find age appropriate women, and it's because they truly suck so much that they seek out naive and docile young women with no life experience who won't judge them for how tremendously they suck.

Take advice from the lived experiences of thousands and thousands of women who have come before you and don't want you to repeat their mistakes: sis he's not in love with you, he's in love with the idea of you.

55,6i6thz,2017-06-19,TwoXChromosomes,That time my dad prohibited me to get my upper leg waxed,"My mom was never much of a ""let's do things together!"" Which was fine but also sucked when it came to me wanting to try things such as manicures, waxing, bra shopping and what not. However, I had a great dad who was always willing to bring me to these things, so I never felt like I missed out on those things. He'd often drop me off and then pick me up or something. 

When I was 16, right around prom time, I decided that I wanted to wax my legs. I mean, I obviously didn't want to have missed spots and I wanted my legs to be smooth and whatnot. My dad was very hesitant. He first said no, not yet, but as prom was approaching I became more and more insistent and he just said fine, that he'd do some research and book an appointment. 

As usually, he held his word and a few days later, I had an appointment with the sweetest waxer I'll probably ever meet. My dad has ONE condition: no upper legs. We convinced him to do a couple inches from my knees, because... Dresses and skirts, but not more than that. 

So that was a little over a decade ago. I continues going to her for a while and then I moved. Summer is here and I booked an appointment with her this morning. After all the catch up we did (a good 5 years!) she said she had to tell me something. 

She told me that before my first appointment, my dad had called her and booked an appointment for himself. He spoke to her about her techniques and whatnot. He requested a full leg shave and she was happy to oblige. After he was done, he told her that he really didn't enjoy any of it but that his 16 year old daughter wanted to her her legs waxed and that he wanted to try it first. He booked an appointment for me that very same day. However, the waxer says that he called the very next day saying he had bruising on his upper legs and that it hurt. The waxer said it was possible and somewhat common, so he vetoed the upper leg for me.

O.M.G. The thing is, this is exactly like my dad. It's something he would do and it's something he'd probably never ever tell me he did. It was just another reminder of how thoughtful he is and always was.

I want to thank you guys for everything. It means so much to hear so much reassurance and hope. Thank you also to everyone who shared their own story with me. 

My daughter is doing well. The staff is optimistic and they all really like her, and she's even smiled and laughed a few times during our visits. I heeded some advice and brought her fuzzy socks and slippers, comfy clothes, her favorite blanket, some stuffed animals she still has, her own toiletries... a lot. She's on board to start therapy asap after discharge so I got her preferences (she wants a woman, understandably) and I'm on the hunt.

I'm setting up therapy for myself as well. Apart from feeling overwhelmed out of my mind, I've also been going through some addiction problems - nothing illegal or life threatening, but I'm done with that shit.))

I am a single father. I just got home from the hospital and I feel so defeated and like everything has crashed and burned today. 

Long story short, this morning I walked in on my daughter sitting on the floor of her bedroom, about to hang herself. We have a great relationship and I even have permission to enter her room if she didn't answer my knocking for a minute because she's always using noise canceling headphones. 

I went to ask her where our dog's harness was, and upon opening the door I just saw her sobbing violently but silently, and looking at the noose hanging in her closet. I knew exactly what it was and I ran to her and yanked it out of her hand.

I told her we had to go to the ER and she began yelling at me. So I ended up calling 911 because I could not physically force her to go on my own.

In the ER, at first she was angry and would not allow me to stay in her room, but she did get calmer and actually asked me to stay because she was scared. We talked to nurses, doctors, and social workers; they were able to get through to her and she admitted how suicidal she was and confided in them that she had been raped by a friend's relative a month prior. 

So they decided to admit her, and that's where we are now. I'm going to visit her every day with her favorite snacks and books. She will be discharged home in (predicted) 7-10 days and I'm looking into getting her a therapist or even a higher level of care if needed. I'm researching trauma and suicide so I can better understand this whole thing. But I'm still so lost and i failed her because I didn't fucking notice what was going on. What else do I do?

EDIT #2: Now: 7:15pm CA time; This is an overwhelming response. From /u/therealsamshady94, my name has been dragged through the mud in the small town of Yuma AZ, the rapist and his fellow police officers perpetuated false rumors about me over the last 18 months but now I couldn't care less. You see, the morning he attacked me I jumped out of a window barefoot with my mom in tow and ran for me life. I had nothing but the shirt on my back, and the knowledge that had I made any noise in leaving that bedroom, he would take his police weapon which was in plain view the entire night, and shoot me. I didn't feel brave. I did what my body told me to do to survive. Thankfully, how I reacted was ""consistent"" with how a rape victim acts after an attack, there was physical and circumstantial evidence, and the San Diego DA believed me, and decided to prosecute. Out of all rape cases only 4% even are brought to a jury for trial. It's sad how rare these things end with a good outcome, and even sadder how few victims are believed. I have to express my gratitude for the responding officers in this case for not treating the perpetrator like a ""brother officer"" in the words of the judge, but like a suspected rapist. I know had this incident occurred in the rapist's hometown of Yuma AZ, the incident would have been handled differently and the outcome much different. Nevertheless I am lucky. I survived. I just want the world to know when he does get out, if he does get out, his name is JARED ELKINS, he is NOT a police officer, like he told another woman that he raped while out on bail, and he is a dangerous SEX OFFENDER. Also, please don't think about how you act after an attack. Just report it.

69,i3v3qo,2020-08-05,TwoXChromosomes,I went to the ER in horrific pain 6 years ago,"I walked into the ER at 4am, doubled over in so much pain that I could barely walk or talk or see straight. I was hyperventilating and so anxious that my muscles were locking up. I really didn't like hospitals, and I certainly didn't like the fact that something was clearly wrong enough for me to be there. I was only 29.

The ER doctor on rotation that night set me up with IV painkillers and had me sent off for scans. The meds helped calm me down, and numbed everything enough that I could stop crying. But when he returned to my bedside, he brought a surgeon with him. They explained the scans looked normal, and my blood work was fine. 

And yet, I was clearly NOT fine. I was in a lot of pain. So they told me they wanted to do exploratory surgery with the intent of removing my ovary, gallbladder, or appendix, most likely. 

I said ok. 

When I awoke from surgery, I was told my appendix had been removed due to some discoloration, but everything else looked healthy. I was to report to the surgeon's office in 10 days for follow up to check on my incisions.

My surgeon stared at my paperwork at the follow up, head in his hands. I thought maybe it was just a long day, unrelated to me. 

""The ER doctor saved your life.""

Turns out I had carcinoid cancer in my apprendix. Its usually pretty asymptomatic, hard to spot, and typically found after it has metastasized all over the place.  

On paper, I should have been sent home with nausea meds and maybe light pain meds and told to see a GI (which would have taken months for an appointment). Statistically, I should have been told to suck it up and it was just a belly ache. But they both believed me. They believed I was in so much pain that the standard diagnostic tools were clearly missing what was actually wrong with me. 

There are so many stories of women's pain being ignored or downplayed. I could have easily been discharged and been one of those women. Who knows how long I would have gone with cancer. 

But they believed me. Both of them. 

They saved my life. And I still think about those two men frequently... how they believed me, a 29 year old woman, about my pain, and took a risk to help me. 

I've been cancer-free for 6 years so far, and get checked every 3 months because this cancer type can pop up randomly. But for now... I'm genuinely thankful those 2 actually believed me.

79,m2akfy,2021-03-10,TwoXChromosomes,I reported a doctor who got my number by accessing my private files and he was fired!,"I took my sister to the emergency last week and the doctor who looked after her was competent and polite. It was a good experience and nothing out of the ordinary happened until a few days later when I got a text from him asking me on a date.

The thing is, I never gave him my number. We didn’t even flirt, in fact our interactions were minimal. I don’t have my number available online anywhere, so the only reasonable explanation is that he looked through my private file in order to get my number. 

I told my friends about it and got mixed opinions. Some of them, mainly the guys, told me to just say no and forget it, and that I shouldn’t over react and report said doctor for merely “shooting his shot”. 

Thankfully, I decided to report him anyway. I made a formal complaint and told my parents about it. Since one of the hospital owners is a family friend, I also forwarded him my report along with a screenshot from the convo.

Well, Ive just been informed that he was fired. Turns out this doctor isn’t a first time offender and is constantly bothering the female staff. Had I chosen to ignore it, he would’ve carry on harassing his patients.

I feel silly for even contemplating the idea of not reporting him. Don’t let your friends gaslight you and speak up every time you feel uncomfortable with something.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the awards and the encouraging messages!

Even though I knew that this doctor’s actions were ethically and legally wrong, I hesitated to report. Even though there would be no major consequences to my life if I filed a complaint, I hesitated. Even though I had a support system who would’ve believed in me, I hesitated. My heart aches for all the woman who sent me messages asking for advice on how to deal with harassment from coworkers, family friends, clients etc... whatever decision you girls make will have stronger consequences to your daily life than mine did.

You said “Is everything okay, sweetie?” At first I thought you were talking to your daughter, but then I noticed your eyes on mine. “Yea, I’m fine,” I managed to get out, chuckling nervously. I shifted my gaze downwards and I think you noticed the tears welling in my eyes. “Go on ahead of me, honey.” Once I had checked out, you put your hand on my shoulder, and said “Everything is going to be alright. We’ve all been there.” I thanked you again, and headed home. I took the test. Luckily, it was negative.

He is very quiet and level headed and well liked by my coworkers and management (we hate all vendors except him lol).

Today he came to me and asked if we have any multi pack Gatorade and said ""usually I don't help customers but he is super nice"" I went out to help and saw some on the topstock shelf  (the shelf above the aisle"") and said I cant reach it since im 4'11.  The coke dude is pretty tall and got it down for him and the customer was pretty short also.  He was friendly and told the coke guy ""I wish I could switch bodys with you I hate being short"" and we both did the fake customer service laugh.  Then he looked at me and said ""I would switch body's with you also or like to be in your body haha"".  The usually quiet coke guy said ""come on man she at at work and went out of her way to help you there is no need for that"" and the dipship replied ""you know you would"" and winked at him.  That was the point he grabbed the gatorade out of his hand and said ""you know what get the fuck out of here"" I was very shocked since he is always quiet and a man of few words and he was visibly pissed and even grabbed his cart and said ""your done get out, there is another walmart 15 mins away"" and the guy left looking defeated and the coke guy even put away all the refrigerated stuff and talked to management about the situation and they had is back.

He’s not doing anything wrong, he’s just playing with two little girls the same way I would, why is this seen as strange in our society? (USA). 

I watched them and kind of stood back because I like to let my daughter play and build independence without me right next to her 24/7, but I was close enough to hear what was being said and watch them interact. He did literally nothing wrong, nothing weird, he was amazing with the way he spoke to them and I wanted to ask if he was a teacher because he was just really great with small children. My daughter was totally comfortable around him and asked him to put her in a swing. He went to pick her up and stopped, looked at me and asked if it was ok. It was and the kids swung together and had fun then we said goodbye and everything was fine. 

I wish it was more acceptable for men to be great with kids without the stigma that there must be an underlying reason for it. It was really one of those “wow” moments where I caught myself in a very biased thought pattern. 

TL/DR: Grown man at the park with his daughter/granddaughter was interacting really well with my daughter and the girls were playing together, I caught myself thinking he might be a creep but I had zero reason to.

Edit: thank you for the awards! I didn’t think this would get very much attention. Men, don’t let people discourage you from having fun with kids.

102,a1j898,2018-11-29,TwoXChromosomes,My brother in law molested my daughter.,"I've known my brother in law for almost 20 years. My daughter is 11 and has never known life without Uncle ""A"". My sister and him have always had a rocky relationship but over the last few years things had gotten better. They bought a gorgeous huge house, he adopted my nephew and they had a baby of their own. They make a decent amount of money and every vacation they've ever taken my daughter has gone with them. I used to joke about how my daughter was closer to A then to my sister. They had a very close bond and he'd buy her things and just spent a lot of time with her. I now know this was grooming. About 3 years ago we moved 5 hours away from all our family. So for the last 3 years I've sent her back home to spend the summers with family. She'd always stay with my sister. 


About a month ago her school had an assembly about inappropriate touching and how to spot it. Her teacher said after one scenario my daughter started to have a panic attack. She pulled her aside and my daughter told her everything. Last Summer when my daughter was down helping my brother in law started to ""accidently"" touch her breasts. She said she thought they were accidents so didn't say anything. Then he just started to outright touch her. The mother fucker told her ""You cant say anything. You know how mad your mom would get at you."" So she kept quiet. I have told this girl since I can remember that if she's ever in that scenario and told that that she will never ever get in trouble nor would I be mad. I've told her ""even if its grandpa, grandma or even your dad. You will never get in trouble. You can tell me anything."" I dont want to go too far into detail of what else was done but thankfully (I guess) it was always over clothes and she wasn't raped. I know had she never spoken up it would have lead to that. The weekend before Halloween we went back home and I left her with him to watch the movie Halloween with my mom and sister. This was the last time he did it and it was more aggressive this time. I remember picking her up and she was just in a terrible mood. I remember thinking it was the usual preteen moody stuff. Its fucking eating me alive to know I handed her to him without so much as a single thought. 


When the school called me I held it together. I brought her home, we talked, we went out to eat and I set her up an appointment with a psychiatrist. When she went to bed I fucking fell apart into my fiance's arms. It took everything in me not to drive back home and kill him. I called my mom and told her I needed her home in the morning cuz I was going home to tell her something very serious. I didn't tell her cu, honestly I believe she would have gone to their house and beat his ass. I took my daughter to school and drove the 5 hours home. I told my mom and we went to my sisters. I took all the documentation CPS and the police gave me. She went into a bit of a shock. She called him with me there and when she told him he said ""Do I need to turn myself in?"" Right then is when it really hit how real this all was. My sister is the strongest person I know. She kicked him out immediately and is in the process of divorcing him. I talked with her a while and then drove the 5 hours back. 


I dont even really know why I'm posting this. This last month I've been a bit of a zombie. Last night we put up our Christmas tree and I had a break down. I watched my sweet innocent little girl hanging ornaments and I felt a rage I've never felt. I just want to ask him how could he. How could he look at her and see anything but the little girl he's known since she was born. The little girl he's watched learn to walk and talk. The little girl that loved him. I'm just a mess today. I'm in the bathroom having a fucking breakdown at work. I've never wanted anyone dead more than him but that's selfish of me. Then I cant help but think of my sister and my 8 month old niece. He ruined everyone's life. Will my niece know her dad? I'm scared my sister will lose her house. Above all I'm scared of the lasting effects this will have on my girl. Will she recover? Selfish fucking bastard.



Edit; I just want to thank everyone for the kind and loving messages I received. I want to thank all survivors of abuse who messaged me to tell me of their perseverance. It was very nice to hear that this rough patch won't last forever for her. We spent a wonderful evening watching football and eating cheese fries. I really do appreciate everyone.

103,baqrve,2019-04-08,TwoXChromosomes,A guy tried to rape me tonight,"I was walking home, 4 blocks from my house. I saw a drunk guy puking over a railing and asked if there was anything I could do to help him. I’ve done this many times before and usually go out of my way to make sure people are safe and at home.

He responded with “Yeah, you can help me get some.”

At that point I said never mind and walked away, but he followed me. I told him in no uncertain terms that he was to stay the fuck away from me. I walked away again.

He followed. He put his arm around my waist. I told him, calmly as I could, to stop. I kept walking, and this time he tried to grab me around my waist. I started running. He chased me. He caught up to me and he pushed me to the ground. He was pinning me down, and I started just screaming in his face, “HELP ME!” as loud as I fucking could.

I didn’t expect anyone to respond. I just wanted to be so loud and annoying that he gave up. In my mind it was my best chance.

But people did respond. Many people. They came out of their houses at 2:00am on a Monday morning to make sure I was ok. They held him in there, on their phones calling the police, while I ran home to safety.

I should have stayed and made a statement. I should have ignored the dude in the first place. I should have done so many things.

But you stepped up tonight, Chicago. Thank you.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your words of support. For those of you that don’t believe me, that’s fine. I don’t need to justify myself to anonymous internet strangers. I wish I could answer all the questions, but the real reason for my post was because of the response I got from my fellow chicagoans, not for the situation itself. The absolute rush of relief hearing someone yell out their third floor window that they hear me and they’re coming down to help...I can’t even describe it.

I don’t regret helping him. Yes, it was terrifying, but I probably won’t fully internalize it for a while yet. It all just seemed super unreal. It made it click why all stories of rape and attempted rape sound so contrived; because the men who would do something like this are all feeding off the same sick urges and act the same way. But I’ll continue to do the dumb thing and check on people. 

As for me, a woman, stopping to help a stranger at 2am: most drunk people say they’re fine, they’re almost home, or that they already called a friend for help. But sometimes they’re too drunk to walk or they’re so lost I’m afraid that without intervention they’ll sleep in an alley. Sometimes they’re too drunk to use their phones and I’ll help them call a friend or an Uber. Most of the time they’re completely unaware how absolutely shitfaced they are. And in Chicago the police don’t respond in any urgent manner if it’s a wellness check. If the drunk person or some other person isn’t in immediate danger, they have better things to do. Personally, I’m willing to possibly put myself in harm’s way if it might mean saving someone else from harm. Odds say I was going to run into this situation eventually and I will be better prepared to handle it if it, god forbid, happens again.

As for self-defense, I’m going to get some mace. I hate guns. If you want to really ramp up a situation, threaten a drunk person. If you want to just redline it, pull a gun. Plus, since I’m a cocktailer, it’s illegal for me to have it at work, and it’s illegal for me to have it on the train home.

As for the statement, I called my friend who is a south side Chicago cop and he walked me through making a statement, what good it will do, what to expect, and what information to focus on. I’ve spent the day thinking about everything that happened so I can give the most important details. He said that since other people have likely already made a statement and I didn’t stay on the scene, one more day isn’t going to make a difference. I’m going to make a statement in the morning.

Now that I’ve calmed down, I’m just mostly angry.  Anger helps motivate me to learn how to navigate a situation better, so I’m gunna let it ride  and eventually maybe it’ll guide me to a therapist. But we will have to see. Thank you again everyone. You really helped me get over a lot of the initial guilt.",marck1022,t2_xfi3r,0.83,34386,1110

Haven't heard from her, but hopefully she is now more on guard. 
  
  
About a year ago I began to feel extremely self conscious about my body and my inability to lose my postpartum baby weight. At the time my husband and I switched from hormonal birth control to condoms and my libido went through the roof. I created this account soon after to look at nsfw subreddits for some alone time fun. It was bolstering to see so many women with similar shape and size to me being adored and I sort of felt like it might be something I'd like to do. With my husband's blessing, I started posting nudes. None with my face or identifying features and I purposely kept my location vague.  It was very validating, and for many many months everything went swimmingly.   
  
Enter the creep. At first he just awarded one of my posts and graciously accepted my thanks. For many, many months I did not hear anything from him. Now, he has become convinced that I am his ex, regardless of any logical argument I try to make (does she also have the same surgery scars as I have? A prominent mole in the same place? Is she the same age as me? [I looked her up and I doubt it; I think I'm way older than she is]). He wouldn't be convinced and told me my posts are breaking up marriages (I sincerely hope this isn't true and I've heard nothing from angry or bereft spouses, so I just truly don't know) and if I didn't stop posting he would come to my home and stab me.  
  
I reported this message using Reddit's report system. Two breathless days later I received a canned response stating that they have reviewed his messages and they ""don't violate Reddit's content policy."" Not only that, but reddit has seemingly removed all way to contact an actual human who runs this site. It's just a giant list of topics now, none of which include the word violence.
  
Wow. Two women threatened with fatal violence, one completely innocent of any of these things, but hey, it doesn't violate their content policy! C'mon Reddit, we can definitely do better! I was so incensed I nearly messaged their CISO (Allison Miller) on linkedin (which would have revealed my actual identity--rather scary in this situation).
  
In conclusion, I know there are some people on here who will condemn me for my choices and I also know that the majority of you likely wouldn't choose this for yourselves. Regardless, we all deserve to feel safe in this space; we deserve the owners and operators of this site to take our safety seriously all the time, in every case.  
  
~~**Edit:** it's been brought to my attention that I missed some posts in ""the great scrub."" I think I may have accidentally hidden them rather than delete them. Anyone know how to un-hide a post? Really sorry if you got an eyeful of something unsavory!~~

For those of you making light of this: it's a serious situation; please, take it seriously. And no, I'm not going to share my nudes any longer--a woman's life is at stake, ffs!

I have lately been making serious attempts at trying to address some of my counterpart gender's concerns on the internet. Yesterday, I made the brave step: Complimenting my male co-worker. 

I was understandably nervous. What if he takes it the wrong way and thinks I'm demonstrating romantic interest (I am not interested). What if that mis-interpretation results in a change in our working environment? Is this a bad idea? Should I be more careful? Shit, what kind of compliment can I give that would be effective, but not come off as flirtatious? 

I took a deep breath, and as casually as I could, approached his desk and said ""Hey, are you losing weight? You look good!"" \*insert casual smile\* He definitely had lost weight, it was enough to be clear, but not so much that it was super obvious. ""What?"" He replied. Oh shit, thats right, he kind of has a hearing problem, and I probably half whispered it, not wanting everyone around us to hear. I took another deep breath, and through a gritty smile, repeated my statement more loudly than I was comfortable. He blinked a few times, processing. He then looked down at his desk, and said sadly ""its not being done voluntarily."" He then opens up to me about how hard he has been struggling with depression, and how he has lost motivation at home to even eat anything. Through his pained expression, he admitted ""The only thing I tried to eat yesterday was a bowl of cheerios. I couldn't get through it. Then I was wide awake till almost 3 AM. Now, I cant tell if what I'm feeling is depression, or just sleep depravation and starvation."" 

I just listened to him for a half hour as he talked about his therapy, his medication, and his struggles. I did my best to comfort and uplift, reminding him that I have always thought very highly of him as a co-worker and a person.

The swing vote on the State Supreme Court is up for grabs, where a victory for liberal JANET PROTASIEWICZ will almost certainly overturn the state's total abortion ban","Here's an article going into more about what's at stake:

* https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-supreme-court-abortion-redistricting-trump-df0a7e5cfec1cd3bf08f14270a1c9615

After Roe v. Wade fell last year, a trigger law from the year 1849 - over a decade before the start of the American Civil War that ended Chattel Slavery - banned abortion in the state. Despite a Democratic Governor ready to sign a repeal, the Republican controlled state legislature has opposed it, and a 4-3 conservative State Supreme Court slow walked the legal challenge. 

However, one of the 4 conservative justices, Patience D. Roggensack, is term limited, and the state elects SCOTUS judges by a vote so the race tomorrow will effectively determine control of the now deadlocked 3-3 court. A win for Judge Janet will give liberals a majority for the first time in 15 years, ensuring a liberal majority court will now have the final say on the legal challenge to the 1849 abortion ban, and in almost 100% likelihood, throw it in the trash.

AND THAT'S NOT ALL 

Wisconsin is victim to the worst Republican gerrymander in the country, where the maps are so rigged that Republicans only need 40% of the vote to control a majority of the state legislature, while Democrats need a 60% supermajority! Watchdogs have called it one of the most dangerous affronts to democracy in the Developed World. The conservative State Supreme Court has done nothing to address this, but a new liberal court majority is very likely to lead to a legal challenge against the maps. If overturned, Democrats would go to having a fair chance of winning a majority in the state legislature and turning the state fully blue like Michigan and Minnesota recently did. It would ensure that not only the monstrous 1849 abortion ban would be overturned, but Republicans would struggle to get back the legislature to ban it all over again. Right now all they need is the Governor's Mansion. 

Janet's opponent, Dan Kelly, is a hardline conservative backed by the three biggest anti-abortion groups in the state. He was part of a scheme to throw out Joe Biden's victory in Wisconsin in 2020 by sending an alternative slate of electors to vote for Donald Trump instead. He is a mad man, and is very likely to uphold the 1849 ban as well as the maps.

He went ahead and to a car. I thought he was leaving. I kept walking. He left the car he did not enter it and followed us again. I directed my son into the craft store. The man followed us in when I looked up at the cctv when you enter. I panicked but was worried for my kid.

\*\*\*UPDATE:  Words cannot express my emotional day reading each and every single one of your comments and messages. There were so many who offered encouragement and praise, I was brought to tears more times than I can count. I am truly humbled by the out pour of support and I feel honored that many felt the courage to reach out to me about their own personal experiences.

I feel the need to provide this update because there were some common themes in responses where I think additional context may be appreciated.

1. Yes, he is in prison and he will be there for quite some time. But no, I do not know if my statement impacted the judge’s decision on length of the sentence. In my state, the victim reads their statement before the judge decides the sentence but after the Defendant has already been found guilty to the crime so, in other words, his crying/apology and my statement in no way allowed him to ‘get out’ of the charges since he was already convicted of the crime by the Court. While the judge displayed empathy/emotions in reaction to my statement, when they were ultimately explaining reasoning for their sentencing decision (and I’m paraphrasing) ‘It is the Court’s responsibility to protect the safety of the community. When all is said and done, the Defendant committed a violent crime and the Court cannot ignore that.’ I was told by the Prosecutor that the sentence he received was in line with what one would typically receive for a crime like this.   

2. I’ve received many questions about Restorative Justice (RJ) and notice that it’s sparked some discussion in the comments. I first learned about RJ in a 60 Minutes episode (Season 51, episode 30, air date May 13, 2019). The host begins the segment with ‘’When we first learned about the RJ Project, it was hard to believe and we certainly didn’t understand it. The program… introduces victims of violence to the convicts who committed the crime. Our first reaction was ‘Who would want to do that, and to what end?’’ Yes, RJ is a very personal choice. It is not for everybody. And that’s certainly okay!  The purpose of our Court system is to hold offenders criminally responsible for their crime but it does little to hold them accountable for the healing of the victim (and other affected parties for that matter). RJ is, in many ways, a solution for many victims and offenders who *voluntarily* choose to do it. Yes, it may not be the perfect solution but please remember that this is an imperfect system. The Defendant’s participation in RJ will in no way affect his sentence. He will not get out early for choosing to participate nor he will not get additional time for refusing to either. It is simply a way for him to have the chance take accountability for the impact on the victim and allows for the opportunity to make things right using facilitation by professionals. Emphasis is placed on avoiding re-victimization at all costs.  Who knows, perhaps I'll change my mind about wanting to pursue RJ, but at least I have the option, and I will be forever grateful to the Judge for understanding and allowing it.  If and when it takes place, which wouldn't be anytime soon, he will still be in prison and I would be visiting him there.

3. I received an overwhelming amount of messages with a common theme of MeToo. I wept with each one I read. To all of you I say, stay strong but also, remember to be kind to yourself. Continue to do what feels right to you. And don’t feel like anyone has the right to make you feel ashamed or guilty for how you feel.  Remember, after someone experiences trauma, they deserve to feel and process it in whichever way is natural to them. If you are rape victim like me, you are used to not being believed. But don’t ever feel like you have to ‘prove’ yourself to anyone. I too have moments of weakness and forget my own advice but again, in these moments, please be kind and gentle on yourself. You are doing the best you can in that moment. 

Thank you again for your outpouring of well wishes and support. I am so truly touched by your messages <3 <3 <3

TW:  sexual assault, violence, court proceedings

&#x200B;

I spent 13-1/2 long months waiting for justice after being raped by a stranger in an alley.  Yet, when it finally came time to write my Victim Impact Statement, I couldn't seem to put pen to paper.  I spent weeks working on it.  Then, after a lot of soul searching, I realized that mercy, empathy and healing were more important to me than any anger I had left.  After I realized that, I wrote my entire statement in one night.

When I looked up after reading it in court, I saw tears coming down the judge's face.  When I looked over at my rapist, he was crying too.  So was his family.  And so was mine.  The judge approved the only request I had, to allow for Restorative Justice programming if/when we would ever want to pursue that.  Afterward the hearing, the Victim's Advocate gave me a hug and thanked me for having the courage to say something so powerful.  I told her I meant every word.

It's hard to describe how I feel but what I can say is that it feels like a HUGE weight has been taken off my shoulders.   I will remember this experience the rest of my life and it brings me comfort to feel like I can finally start to let go.  Anyways, I have included the statement in this post - bear with me, it's a tad long.  But I feel the need to get this off of my chest.  Please remember that crime affects everyone differently and in my case, I felt like empathy and the need to pursue a different avenue (restorative justice) was right for me.  However, I can completely understand how others in this situation may feel the exact opposite.  At the end of the day though, Everyone deserves to feel how they feel!

\*\*\*Victim Impact Statement - TW:  sexual violence, anal rape mention

Thank you, Your Honor, for allowing me this opportunity to address the Court today.

This crime that the Defendant committed against me has affected every facet of my life.

Before all this happened, I knew who I was and I liked who I was. I was certain that the groundwork provided by my education, my military service, and flourishing professional career would stand me in good stead whatever challenges may lay ahead. I was proud, I was independent, and optimistic about my future. But unfortunately, the actions of the Defendant on one horrible night irreversibly changed me and the course of my life in so many ways.  After this, it felt like my life wasn’t mine anymore. In one night, he shattered me into a thousand pieces, and I have spent the last 13 ½ months cleaning up the mess he made.

For a long time, I was not a functioning person. After this happened, I couldn’t sleep for months. I stayed up, rocking back and forth with the lights on, my bedroom door barricaded because I was so afraid. You see, Your Honor, when you don’t know where your attacker is, then he is everywhere. He is every sound in the night. Every noise outside your window. Always coming to get you. I spent endless nights unable to sleep, plagued by nightmares replaying what had happened to me. There were many days I couldn’t even get out of bed, let alone leave my house. When I did manage to get out, I was in a constant state of hypervigilance, jumping at every little sound or movement behind me. I missed countless hours at work and my performance suffered as a result. I fell behind on my bills, even my mortgage at one point, and am still working on picking up the pieces in the many other areas of my life.

For weeks, I cried every time I went to the bathroom because of the pain from the injuries, a constant reminder of the worst night of my life. I am often riddled with anxiety and every time I feel frozen with panic, I am reminded of the sheer terror I felt while he was raping me to the point that I could barely move. I still wish I would’ve fought back harder but, in hindsight, my body was frozen in both fear and pain. The moment he inserted himself into me anally, an act that I had never experienced before that moment, it felt like my body had been split into two. The kind of pain where you’re frozen in place. A kind of pain I will surely never forget. It consumes you and there is nothing you can do. When it was over, I remember running away from him in fear, thinking that he would surely come after me. Another feeling that still sticks with me to this day. The flashbacks did not begin for several months but once they did, they came with a fury. On a good day, they would last for only a few seconds, leading me into a panic attack with a lingering aftermath lasting a day or two. On a bad day, they went on for what seemed like hours and were every bit as physically and emotionally painful as the real event often resulting in several days of missed work to recover. On the worst day, I was hospitalized.

For the first time in my life, I am taking medications for things like anxiety, sleep, mood, and nightmares. Over the past year, I’ve attended over 30 appointments with my medical providers, most of them for psychiatric services or mental health therapy, but several were also for mental health urgent care and even one hospitalization. I am very fortunate to receive low cost healthcare because without it, I’m not sure I would be in the place I am today.  In total, my medical bills amounted to only hundreds of dollars, as reflected in the Restitution form, but more so I think they truly represent the significant impact this has had on me.

For a long time, my faith in others was destroyed. I silently condemned every man I didn’t know, since I automatically assumed that their only intention was to harm me. I felt unreasonable revulsion for any individuals who looked like the Defendant, making it nearly impossible at times to interact with fellow colleagues, my healthcare professionals, and even some friends, all at no fault of their own, but all because they simply resembled the Defendant.

I think it’s worth mentioning that I do not know the Defendant, Mr <removed name>, he is a complete stranger to me. I am not ‘out to get him’ because I don’t even know him. I still remember the officer asking me if I knew the name of the man who had raped me, and I realized I had no idea who he was, a feeling I fear may stay with me for a very long time to come. In fact, I did not even learn his name until several days after he was arrested when someone at the DA’s office casually brought it up in conversation without the slightest idea that I was hearing his name for the first time. I’ll never forget that moment. It took my breath away. Even now, over a year later, there’s a sort of empty hole inside of me because of this and there’s not a single day that goes by where I don’t think about what the Defendant did to me.

Probably the most unpleasant feeling is that of the lasting guilt. Not for the rape-- that was on the Defendant -- But for the consequences of doing the “right thing” and reporting to the authorities: putting a man behind bars and causing his loved ones to suffer immensely.  I think about this often.

The punishment he receives today will no doubt be difficult for him, but I am someone who generally looks for the best in people and I have to believe that you, Mr. <removed name>, are strong enough to overcome this, and that somewhere in the process you will seize the opportunities for healing and growth. The most important thing is to ensure events like these don’t happen, ever.

In reality, I do not believe people should be defined by the worst moment of their life and what I seek more than anything else is peace of mind. Having, in a sense, been served with my own sentence, I must find a way to live out my life in peace. If it were up to me, the only resolution I would seek is that of restorative justice. I want nothing more than for the Defendant to take responsibility for his actions, understand the significant impact that this has had on not only me, but many others in both of our lives, and to learn from this, so that all parties involved can move on with their lives. Which leads me to the only request I have for you today, Your Honor, I ask that you consider amending the No Contact Order to allow for an exception for the case of restorative justice programming.

I understand that this is not the time or place to facilitate restorative justice practices and that the purpose of the judicial court is to hold individuals criminally responsible for their actions so, I will only say this further. I hope one day, Mr <removed name>, you can find the courage from knowing that your participation in this type of programming will not result in punitive punishment. You know what happened on the night of January <removed specific date>, 2019. You know and I know. And you can’t erase that.  Most importantly, remember that you are paying the price of your own choices, while I have to pay the price of a choice that you did not give me. This request I ask of the Judge today is about giving you the opportunity to take accountability for your actions and a chance to make things right, not only for you and me, but for all of our loved ones who have been affected by this as well.

I sincerely hope that you find strength, companionship, and moments of peace to reflect in these difficult days. I wish safety, health, and continued support from your loved ones while in incarceration. I know that I would not have made it here today without the incredible support network that I have found in my family, colleagues, and friends since this happened. After finishing your punishment, I sincerely hope you reintegrate quickly into society and go on to live a happy life. Most importantly, I hope you are able to find the inner courage within to accept accountability for your actions.

And with that being said, I leave here today, Your Honor, with a sense of peace, confident in knowing that whatever you decide for sentencing today will be appropriate and just. After all, justice is not justice, if it is not just for all.

Thank you",emmmalee,t2_2y5slvt,0.82,32796,1238
130,hzvj2i,2020-07-29,TwoXChromosomes,Today a dick in my drive thru decided it would be appropriate to start masturbating in front of me as I handed him his food. So I got the police involved and they called his parents on him.,"Sadly, this has always been a fear of mine. Whenever men fiddle around in their pockets, I always get this flash of paranoia that they're secretly jerking off to the fact that we're unaware. Today it actually happened.

I work at a rather popular coffee chain, and our particular location is incredibly busy, fast paced, and stressful. Customers haven't exactly been the nicest during the pandemic, and I have to put up with a lot of verbal harassment, and I've had people actually threaten to come inside to throw some hands, but this really takes the cake.

I'm a supervisor and took over at the window for my co-worker's break. Two customers into this line, this guy pulls up to collect his order. I kindly greet him, look at his face, repeat his order and hand him his stuff. I noticed he was having a rather hard time focusing on putting his damn card in the stupid chip reader. I was focused on him paying for his shit, so my eyes were on his card, waiting for the ""approved"" text to flash across the screen. An error appeared instead, and as I was about to ask him to try sliding the card, my eyes curiously focused in on what he was doing with his right hand.

I saw something wrinkly and shriveled up in his hand, and at first, I thought it might have been his wallet stuffed with bills, but then I realized it was his *tiny, flaccid, wrinkly, caterpillar looking ass, Jabba the Hutt looking ass penis*. He was fucking *WANKING HIMSELF* while staring into my eyes. I was shocked, disgusted, and very angry. Unfortunately for him, I'm very loud, and very vocal.

*""WHAT THE FUCK .""* I yelled. Customers in the lobby could hear me shouting, poor things. My coworkers were shocked, and confused. ""ARE YOU FUCKING *SERIOUS*, DUDE?!""

He's wearing a mask, but I could see his eyes crinkle. He smiled at me. Of *course* he was pleased by my reaction.

He quickly yanks his card away, and attempts to speed off, but gets stuck behind two other cars in the drive thru. I stick my head out the window to memorize his plate number, but realize I'm in too much of a panic to think straight, so I run to the front of the store, throw the door open, and whip out my phone to take pictures of his truck as he speeds off. 

Unfortunately for him, my phone camera takes *wonderful* pictures. The resolution was crisp and I could clearly read the plate number. I called the police, and they showed up a whopping two hours later. After some research on their end, they pulled up the owner of the car, who was a lady. They called the number, and spoke to a man who apparently was her husband. He had an alibi, but named his 18 year old son who lives with them. He was shocked and apologetic, and said he'd ""talk to his son"", whatever that means. The police officer made it clear we didn't want them returning to our location, and that he would be arrested for trespassing. 

My coworker recognized him and his car; he had come through our drive thru just two days prior to today. I have many young, female coworkers, a few who *only just* turned 18, that I don't want subjected to this kind of crap. I can't imagine how mortified and frozen with fear they would have been.

Hopefully the official police report gets finalized soon so that I can get a fucking restraining order on this dude. I'm so upset, I want to take it even further and get him put on a sex offender list. Ugh.

Why. Why?

Edit:

Since apparently *some* people think my post is fake, here's a fake collage of fake photos I took of his fake truck as he fake drove off through the fake parking lot.

Another edit:

Some people messaged concerned for my safety, so I took the pictures of the truck down. I had no idea this post would blow up. Apparently the picture is still visible, so I messaged the mods to see if it can be removed.

Another another edit:

I'm absolutely blown away by all the comments and messages I've been receiving. Thank you guys! For the awards, the kind words, the well wishes. I'm just really tired. I only got a few hours of sleep last night, I laid awake with my eyes closed for at least an hour. I'll be back later to try and respond to people as things calm down. But I hope that the victims and women out there feel just a bit more empowered to act and do something when they feel afraid of freezing up. And I hope you have people in your lives who would stick up for you, and do everything I did and more to protect you. We don't deserve this crap. ♥️ I hope you guys are having a wonderful day.",wontonbitch,t2_33p8zb9l,0.86,32782,1173
132,ycblta,2022-10-24,TwoXChromosomes,Be careful if you are homeless and on Reddit,"I am most likely going to be homeless by the end of November.

I check their profile and each one of these mens posts are about seeking a woman to have sex, bdsm posts, and worst of all “breeding”. These men want to abuse you. I just block them but I wanted to spread the word in case someone just takes them at face value and trust them.

I am going to have to uninstall my app for a few days, as I am also getting hate and I am just overwhelmed with all of the comments, and everything in my personal life.

133,c4jg1r,2019-06-24,TwoXChromosomes,I got a sexual harasser fired today,"I was walking to high school this morning, school uniform and bag on, when a guy in a parked delivery truck started banging on his window. When I turned around to see what was going on, he started blowing kisses at me and winking. YUCK. In a company vehicle, to a girl in school uniform WITH A SCHOOLBAG ON so he knew I was underage (I'm 16). Well I wasn't having it. After flipping him off, I took photos of the number plate, the truck, and that fucker's face. 

&#x200B;

When i got to school I decided to call customer service from the company truck he was in and make a complaint. To my pleasure, a woman picked up the phone and she was just as angry as I was. She told me she'd pass it on to someone above her who can deal with it. An hour later I get a phone call in the middle of class. It was the HEAD OF HR who told me that the guy in the truck wasn't affiliated with their company; they hired him as a subcontractor but THEY FIRED HIM! He no longer works for their company all thanks to my phone call. It's put me on a high all day and I am so proud of standing up for myself!

134,63i0n9,2017-04-05,TwoXChromosomes,To the guy who helped my niece tonight!,"My darling niece (18) went out tonight for a few drinks with her friends, it was her first night out without any aunties/sisters with her, she finally felt confident enough to do it.

After a few drinks and some laughs they went different ways home, 2 caught a taxi, my niece and her friends went to get the bus. Her friends bus left 10 minutes before hers usually arrived so she was happy enough to say goodbye and wait by herself, it wasn't even 10. She did her usual text to her mum and myself saying she was at the bus stop would text when on the bus.

While waiting 3 boys saw her and proceeded to chat her up. One of which moved her bag to the other side of him and blocked her from getting it. She had one on her right, one on her left and one blocking her in the front. They were trying to get her to go somewhere with them. Told her they knew a great place to get drinks, they would by them for her all night, even had a place for her to stay if she missed her bus. She told them no and asked nicely if they would leave her alone, they werent listening!

After a few minutes this lad comes up to them, takes her bag off the seat, grabs her hand and tells the boys thanks for looking after his lady and pulled her away from them.
Whole walking her down the street he tells her to walk normal, his names jake and he was going to get her home.
He asked what her name was, asked her if she could videocall someone on her phone for him.

She calls me, I answer and this sweet guy tells me his name, his age and why he was with her. He walks to his car opens the door for her then walks around his car showing my his number plate and any marks he has on his car. He also tells me to screen shot his face and his number plate.

He took her home, told her mum she was being harassed and he had to do something to help her. Anything could have happened to her but he made a decision to not let the happen. 

Thank you for showing her what a real man does, thank you for making her feel safe, thank you for making me see that some men are still raised right and thank you for asking her out on a date I'm hopeful it turns out to be as amazing as you seem to be!!

EDIT: For the people I offended by using 'real man', compared to the 3 boys who harassed her, made her uncomfortable, wouldn't leave her alone, suggested things to her, invaded her personal space, he is a real man. He made sure she was safe, he had a chance to take her out of a potentially dangerous situation and he took it. Real men help woman when they need to be helped, they don't use their size to intimidate woman, to try and pressure them. You are probably going to have a problem with this last statement but my niece is safe thats all that matters.",wishocouldremember,t2_150t8z,0.79,32407,1358

141,gzq3c9,2020-06-09,TwoXChromosomes,My experience being a woman of color in the US,"Hi all. Throwaway for privacy.

I have seen a lot of stories come forth about what life is like when you have a little extra melanin. I have a lot of friends that sympathize, but they cannot really fathom what it is like. I wanted to share mine. For reference, I grew up in a middle class area in a liberal state. If this is not the place for this, please let me know. But these are experiences that I have lived. Sorry about the length and thank you for reading. On mobile so formatting.


Age 5: My best friend was a blonde little girl. One day, we were walking out of our kindergarten class together, and her father saw us walking together. He rushed forward and put his arm around her shoulder and ushered her away from me as quickly as he could. Later in the school year, we wanted to hang out after school like little five year old girls do. Her mother called my mother and told her how my mom made her uncomfortable, and she no longer wished to have us be friends.

Age 5 on: Having people be surprised that my mom is white, and be ridiculed for it.

Age 8: Called a n***** and told to get off of someone’s property, I was told that I was allowed to play there.

Age 10: Approached by a basketball coach and forced to play(I had NO talent for basketball).

Age 14: Shopping for dresses with my best friend. As we wondered the store, the same clerk followed us. They try to hide it, they are putting away clothes. We ask my mom why we keep seeing her, and my mom tells us that we are getting the “special treatment”.

Age 15: Shopping for hair supplies at a store aimed at black hair products. The Asian owner followed us the entire time, “straightening up” right next to us. When we tried to leave after buying something, which she saw, before we could leave the store, she accused us of shoplifting. She had literally just watched us buy the item that she observed us select from her special treatment.

Age 17: My now husband and I had just gotten out of school, and we walked down the street to the Rite Aid to get some snacks. The security guard refused to allow me to inter the store with my backpack, and they made us leave it up front at the cashier. The guard proceeded to just happen to be patrolling the store in whatever area we were in.

Age 18: I realized how difficult it is to find a hair stylist, because you can 100% tell when someone is afraid to touch your hair, or how obvious it becomes that they have no idea what they’re doing. But you learn to just pay them and don’t go back.

Age 19: We decided to get married. My husband’s dad told him, “You know she’s black. Your kids will be too.” His uncle told him he couldn’t believe he was marrying a n*****. His dad still treats me like absolute shit to this day. We have gone low contact.

Age 20: Realized that when I’m not being followed while I’m shopping, when I actually want help I get treated like I’m wasting their time. Or it’s hard to even find someone that will talk to me.

Age 20: I was at in class a predominately white university. I was the only black student in the class while we were reviewing Langston Hughes, and I was asked more than anyone to give my thoughts on the experiences he talked about.

Age 21: Attempted to get a job as a 911 dispatcher. I made it all the way to the portion where you have a super long interview about your life with a sheriff. He continually asked me about my “troubled past”(There isn’t one) and he didn’t believe me when I told him that I have NEVER been in trouble for anything. He asked me if I’d ever had sex in the car, or in any public places. To this day I don’t know why that was relevant. I did not get the job.

Age 22: I got hired at my current organization because I’m black and I speak Spanish. How do I know? The manager that hired me told me, “Thank God you speak Spanish, when I saw that you were black and that you’re fluent, that’s all I needed to know!” She proceeded to try to performance manage me out, in an attempt to say “Well, we tried to hire a minority but it just didn’t work out.”

Age 23: I ran into the same dad from my age 5 recount while I was at work one day. He knew I got married because his daughter was my bridesmaid. He proceeded to tell me how he daughter had done things “the right way” by going to school and finishing first before dating/getting into a relationship, and that he was so proud of her, but was sorry that I hadn’t had the same luck.

Age 24: People are surprised at how long and “soft looking” my hair is. I get asked a lot if it’s a weave or if I’ve permed it. A lot of unsolicited touching. Can we take a second and imagine that in reverse? I’ve never had my hands in a white girl’s hair, but imagine if I walked up to a complete stranger, announced that fact, and ran my fingers through her hair. I’d probably get arrested for assault.

Age 25: I was newly pregnant. It was my third pregnancy, but I had no living babies. My previous doctor couldn’t see me, so I had to find a new one. I found an OB that would see me, and my husband came. The doctor spent the entire time(without actually examining me) telling me how this pregnancy was not viable. He would not let me leave without getting a STD test. I told him my husband and I are exclusive and we’d been together for 11 years. “Well, you never know.” He took the sample anyway during my pelvic exam. When he did the ultrasound, he happily proclaimed that he was right, my uterus was empty. He offered to redo it in 2 weeks. When I left, the nurse gave me multiple pamphlets about being a black mom, and over the next several days I got calls from social workers offering free services and items for low income minority mothers. I never asked for that. They didn’t know my income. That same baby from that non-viable pregnancy is a year and a half now.

Age 25: It was a group of us out dress shopping for my best friend’s wedding. We stopped for lunch, and we had to wait for the restaurant to open. We were first waiting at the door, but were not seated first(This restaurant does not take reservations). They proceeded to proceed and wait on 6 other tables, who had ordered and gotten their food, before we were even approached to order our meals.

Age 26: I was pregnant with my daughter and I called into the doctor’s office multiple times with alarming symptoms. My blood pressure was high, and my limbs were so swollen I couldn’t sleep because they were hot and throbbing. My symptoms were dismissed until it was almost too late. Even when I was at the ER with trouble breathing and a pain in my chest, I was almost sent home. I still thank God for the OB that ran to grab me before I got discharged and diagnosed me with pre-ecclampsia. She saved mine and my daughter’s lives.

Age 26: My daughter was in the NICU for 66 days. Any concerns I raised about her care were brushed under the rug. There was a point where I complained to multiple nurses about the mask that they pushed into her face, and they were ignored. She has a scar on her nose now that was 100% preventable.

I want everyone to just imagine for a moment. Imagine that you just got a job. You’re ecstatic. But you walk in on your first day scared out of your mind, because you know you have to prove you’re worthy to be there. There is no one else that looks like you.  Imagine going shopping. Minding your own business when you notice the same person keeps asking you for help. Imagine not knowing if your friend group looks down on you because of how you look. Imagine your health, your feelings, your LIFE not being taken seriously. Imagine being made out to be a criminal before anyone even knows you, and being told “wow, you’re not like other black girls”. Imagine being told “Wow, you’re pretty/intelligent/well-spoken for a black girl.” Imagine being questioned in your own home, or on your way home, simply because you look like someone that committed a crime.

Have you ever been pulled over by a police officer? Were you scared? What did you say? Imagine being pulled out of your car because the officer suspects you to have drugs, but you were on your way to school. You’re forced out of the car, put in cuffs and you’ve got a boot on your back while you watch the cop’s partner plant the drugs in your own car. You go to prison for it. Your life is forever changed. Or this, that you were a little tired coming home from work, and you swerved a little. The officer pulls you over and arrests you for a DUI, regardless of having a 0.0 BAC.

I luckily have not been a victim of police brutality. However, my own brother has. He approached a man and was asking for assistance. The man claimed he had a gun, which he didn’t. That was apparently all the proof the court needed to convict, and he went to prison for three years.

Please, tell me again that we are equal. Please, tell me again that we should protest peacefully. We tried that. He took a knee during the national anthem and was fired for it. Tell me again that I should just deal with how things are, and to learn my place. That I should understand that I am intimidating because of my skin tone.

No. I will not sit down. I will not make excuses anymore that this is okay. I do not want to have to explain to my daughter and son how to not get shot by a police officer, because no matter what we do, no matter how little we resist and go with the flow, we are injured. We are set up. We are jailed. We are MURDERED simply for existing. There is no more time to be quiet. Yes, all lives absolutely matter. But the problem is that black lives matter less than white lives. The system needs to change, and it starts with you.

Told his friends to leave me alone and let me talk to her (as they kept trying to keep me and her away from each other). Told my roommate that he was afraid for her and she needed to leave with me. Shook my hand and gave me a hug and told me to get home safely and then walked off with his friends, telling them they are dicks. His friends were assholes to him the whole time. Whoever you are mark, I hope you find better friends because you deserve better friends. I felt so validated and respected as a person and as a woman that he understood my uncomfortableness, understood the danger to me and my friend and helped us to get to a better situation (as at this point the guys were pressuring her to go to their place and do...

157,gox55q,2020-05-23,TwoXChromosomes,a guy i went to college with venmo’d me $106 today,"one night a weeks ago i was mindlessly scrolling through facebook when i saw a post from a former college friend that had recently started driving for door dash. he had lost his job due to the virus and he wrote about how in the wake of the pandemic, as the need for delivery began to increase rapidly, he had half a dozen people leave him $0 tip on the delivery.  

as a former waitress i was very upset seeing this. if you can’t afford at LEAST $1 on a delivery order, you shouldn’t be ordering delivery to begin with. i commented on his post, agreeing that people can really suck, and proceeded to venmo him $6. 

that week i had really been feeling helpless with the current world situation. i had donated blood, gone shopping for some elderly neighbors, venmo’d my favorite to nurse to treat her to coffee, but i was just still feeling hopeless. sending this $6 was almost instantaneous for me, and after he thanked me, i thought nothing almost nothing more of it. (i am lucky to be able to work from home now and currently have a steady job).

today i was out running and over my headphones i heard the venmo noise go off. i wasn’t in a particularly good running groove and i was surprised, so i stopped to check out what it was. it was a venmo notification for $106. when i saw his common first name along with such a nice message, i was very confused at first. i thought it was a mistake somehow. it wasn’t until i opened up the app and saw his last name that i made the connection. 

he wrote that he would never forget that i cared, and how i should continue being me and how good things will come. i messaged him out of confusion. i never expected him to pay me back let alone gift me more. he said that he started a new job, his life was back to normal and with his first paycheck he wanted to give back to me because i had shown him such kindness. 

i was speechless then, i’m still pretty speechless now. promising to pay it forward.

edit: wow! i went to bed last night and this had 11 up-votes and 4 comments. i woke up to so much more. so many nice comments about people feeling inspired to pay it forward, and so many comments about how tipping is wrong, and my comment about my friend deserving at least $1 was entitled. i stand by my comment, when you order a service here in the US you are knowingly agreeing to tip. i'm not saying the system isn't messed up. but that is how it is.

I appreciate this sub and the support and comfort it offers to women from different backgrounds, so I thought it would be a great platform for dialogue on an issue that somewhat troubles me.  


As you know, women in the Global South face immense challenges and hardships on different levels in order for them to be able to live as ""normally"" as possible that range from simple, mundane things like driving and going out to major challenges in education, marriage and careers.


I feel resentment when I see western women taking up causes such as:

* Freeing the nipple

* Showing off their menstruation blood

* Manspreading/mansplaining 


I find these causes extremely belittling and trivial when compared to women get killed, imprisoned or mutilated just because they wanted to study, or to not marry a certain man, or not be forced to adopt certain clothing. 


Example:
A woman can't show off her nipples in New York. A woman in Karachi can't show her face because it's been destroyed in an acid attack.  



Do you see how privileged and disconnected it sounds to us, on the other side? Is that truly what oppression and suffering means to the Western women taking up these causes? 


I expect angry responses. I truly am not trying to be antagonistic or undermine any group of women. It is just extremely difficult to comprehend how these issues are considered revolutionary when there are much more deeply rooted problems, particularly economic and political, that should be at the forefront? 



I do understand that causes are not mutually exclusive and one can take up a fight on multiple fronts (socio-cultural-political-economic).  


It just feels like there is an immense disconnect and lack of intersectionality between women in the Global North and in the Global South. Yes partially it is because of the difference in living standards which accordingly dictate different issues and problems, but ..just help me understand. Why are these issues important to you, and how do they make sense to you in the bigger [global] picture?

165,avh5yg,2019-02-27,TwoXChromosomes,To the guy who called 911 on me,"Thank-you. 

I think about you a lot and what you did for me that night. 

My (now-ex) was very drunk that night. I should’ve known better than to go out with him and his friends when they were that intoxicated. I should’ve stepped off the subway right away and went back home when I realized how drunk they were, but I thought things were better now. I would learn that night just how wrong I was. In hindsight, I should’ve left him entirely a long time ago. 

They started bullying me during that subway ride and so I got off at the next stop when I couldn’t take it anymore. They followed me off and he was so angry at me. He pushed me hard and I fell down. When I tried running up the stairs, he came for me again and so I punched him in the face. This only made him angrier and so he pushed me onto the stairs as I was climbing, and then picked me up and threw me down the stairs. Then they all ran away and left me there lying at the bottom. 

I pulled myself up quickly and sat on those same steps wondering how the fuck I let myself end up here. You approached me and asked me if I was okay. I recognized you, as you were sitting near us on the subway (I was looking around at everyone because I was embarrassed people were watching) . You saw the whole thing happen. You gave me a pat on the back, and walked away. Eventually I left the underground and sat just outside the station. I didn’t know what to do. What I wasn’t expecting, was for my angry ex to return to the station, angry that I didn’t follow him. I sat there while he threatened and screamed at me. If I fought him I’d have lost, he was so much stronger and there was nowhere to run. 

Out of nowhere a police car shows up and separates us. He sent my ex away and helped me call a cab to a friends house. That’s when I noticed you, standing off to the distance, watching. And when my ex finally walked away out of eyesight, you went back down into the subway tunnel. 

I didn’t realize it at the time, but I now realize it was you that called the cop. He told me someone had called. And you watched them getting aggressive with me on the subway, and followed us off to make sure I was okay. You called the police even after I told you it was okay. IDK what would’ve happened if you didn’t.

And i am not even the targeted minority here, we have legit 99.99% of rape and harrasement victims of the entire female population, 


We have such a toxic culture , where if you got raped your social life is over and you should kill yourself ""sheikhs have said that"" and that the only way out of it is marrying the bloody rapist , so girls just never tell


But in private and in a safe space everyone has over a shit ton of stories, girls get raped no matter what age or what they were , then some sheikhs come and say ""they provoked it on themselves by wearing those clothes"" 


Then u ask what clothes are ok, they go anything other than a hot short, some other will go, no anything other than hijab is wrong and worthy of rape, and some go no no it's either niqab or rape, and some go, that women getting out of their houses is enough to provoke men


They are literally  excusing actual rape, and some young sheikh with 2 million followers was asked ""what about women who wear niqab yet get raped?"" He replied "" it's because men saw earlier women wearing provocative clothing, so the pent up pressure is forced upon them""


WHAT, I don't mind horrible and dumb thinking , but not when it has this influence and has no logic or proof or sense or anything


Imagine having Christian friends in this community, if i walk with a girl in the street we get harrased together and commented on, and people walk up to is saying dumb and offensive stuff like ""get out of here we don't want sluts like you here"" ""hey prostitute come to me after him please""


And the worst part is, i am a coward, I can't stand up though i know i am right, i can't defend or help anyone because i know if i even try to do anything they will harm both me and her horribly, and it will be without purpose


I open social media to find 80% of people supporting rape culture , actual rape, because who wouldn't when you have the power, every female friend I've gotten close to has told me a story of messed up sexual harrasement, and many of them have shared suicidal thoughts 


Any woman who tries to say anything is branded an ""atheist"" and a dumb ""feminist"", if a woman walks alone , no matter what she is wearing has the chance of 99.99% of getting raped or harrased, and he can't tell anyone or defend herself or either she is a dumb atheist feminist and how dare she think she has the same rights as men to walk in the street


And why would i come whine here, is it karma whoring, or virtue signaling


No, the issue is that people that share my thoughts here are people who are already rich enough to live in upper class and have enough influence and money to stop it, never face people like this, so we have not much of any activism


I have no platform, money, followers, looks, smarts, anything


I always came to reddit to find relatable people and ignore the hell hole i live in, but it's becoming harder everyday, and i am scared and weak, I don't even know what i want


If anyone can do anything, wether awareness, support or any form of help 


Please do, i hate being a weakling but that is who i am, i hope i can reach out to someone or people that can help, save me, save us


(edit:many people have this misconception , but i am a male, and i don't promote the idea of just travelling to a safe space, though logical and should be done,the idea of giving up on my country and leaving my friends and family behind to rot is holding me back , and stop blaming islam corrupt people will use whatever people are following and twist it)
 
Going even deeper, women aren't encouraged to find a job or travel or study much, as much as they are told ""when you marry a man, you'll be free to do as you please"", newsflash ,nope

There was a story of 2 women surrounded by 200 rapists, they sat in a store and called for help, and out was standing the rapists trying to get in, the  store owner had to kick them out because they might cause his property damage, from start to finish it is recorded and it is horrifying,and media said ""it's up for debate, did you see what they wore"", literally they had to get 4 male friends fighting a crowd of gropers who laughed as they pulled them from clothes and hair as they were crying

Women get called horrible shit and bullied online, people ""sliding""into the dms with entitlement, that if women don't respond , they steal pictures and threaten them with photoshoping them on nude bodies and ruin their lives and share them, while sending horrendous comments and pictures, and that is not extreme cases it also is a the norm

People who grope in public, harras online, black mail , are considered ""cool"" people ""living the life""

People of our community are discouraged to travel and leave the country, it's considered unpatriotic, and they always go ""look at their politicial issues, the even accept gays, they are no better than us if not worse, stay in a muslim country"" ,so most people think that this is the same everywhere, so no one seeks change or asylum as much

(People on reddit are twisting my words and using them to push political views, the same issue i am against, i stated facts of what happens, that any research will prove me right, i have said my own personal experience that many in the comments share similar experiences if not worse, if i am being punished for saying what is happening and what i feel about it , then so be it)

But i never advocate they stop taking immigrants, i support it whole heartedly,and it the most reasonable choice for us, and should be accepted by all

I never said i am against islam and said my issue was never with islam, it's with corrupt people in power here who use whatever works to control people, wether comedy, religion,culture,
Plus i am a Christian hence my name, and there are Christian people using Christian faith to support this insanity, so apparently the way i see it, the issie is with culture not religion currently

People will put their fingers in their ears and say i am a puppet, or i am a blind retard who supports islam, or a puppet made to be anti islam, the the whole post is about people like you who twist words to get what they want 

I am not saying arabs are bad, i am saying we still have a long road to go, and i hope we go it , so people DMing or commenting, do some research then come with an argument, not ""he's wrong, cuz I don't want to think about this""


And if you want to do research, there is the story of the 2 girls surrounded by the 200 rapists with videos proof, there is the story of the rapist of over 100 in the auc his name is ahmed something and was only jailed because public outcry but  will be let loose in no time after the fuss is over, just like what happend last time when another controversy happened when a teen killed another teen for defending a hirl from sexual harrasement, while caught in camer, it was glossed over , and you have sheikh abdullah elroshdy , he is one of the famous radical fake sheikhs, who abuses people's lack of knowledge and uses islam as a veil for his extremist thoughts, and he has a huge following

The problem is, no one in Egypt is denying these things happened, the problem is hos they excuse it, do your research if you want, talk to any girl who lives in egypt, males here don't notice it, and won't notice it unless they get  of their own way and they excuse it in their head, i am jot cherry picking, literally ask any girl who lives in Egypt",_JohnTheAwesome_,t2_3v2dglp,0.9,29036,1409
172,7i85nr,2017-12-07,TwoXChromosomes,"I have a Yeast Infection, No Money, No Health Insurance, and I went to Planned Parenthood. My Visit and Treatment Was Covered by Their Insurance.","[Yeast infection, Planned Parenthood, Great Review]

I’ve had a really persistent yeast infection for just over a month now and I went to planned parent hood to get it checked out. I have about 2 cents in my bank account, I am a 21 year old female. I’m currently uninsured, I’m a full time student (on my own) who is also a Resident Assistant, and works for the Campus Recycling Center. Being an RA covers my college room and board, and I get a stipend of $20 bi weekly. I work 8 hours a week at the recycling center and get about $120 bi weekly. That’s a grand total of $140 every two weeks. So I’ve been avoiding going to the doctors because I really cannot afford it. I tried using Monistat ($16) because that worked the last time I was yeasty. It didn’t work this time. 

My male sexual partner has insurance so I suggested that he go to Planned Parenthood to get an STI test done just for us to be safe. He did and he came up clean, but he also went out of his way to ask about yeast infections while he was there. 

Planned Parenthood explained the complications of yeast infections and that sometimes it needs a medicine to clear it up. He also asked Planned Parenthood about payment. Based on my income, the visit AND treatment would be under $30. I can afford that easily. I made my appointment despite only have 2 cents in my bank account. 

I made my appointment online. It was so easy that I did it during my ecology lecture. It was a little weird having “Planned Parenthood” pop up on my phone screen, my professor probably thinks I’m pregnant now. But overall it took maybe 7 minutes.

I had my appointment yesterday morning and it went literally so well. My male partner brought me. Everyone working  there was female! I had two young females assist me. They spoke to me like a real person with a real issue, and they really empathized with me. (Because all vaginas have maintenance issues at one point or another). We talked about birth control, yeast, diabetes, college, and I felt zero judgement. They got their samples and ran their tests. The yeast infection was positive, and they gave me medicine right there on the spot. One for now, and one for later. The best part was I didn’t pay a dime! Since I have 2 cents in my bank account, and because I make about $130 a every two weeks, they had me fill out an insurance application, and now I will be covered by insurance for the visit. I can even go online to complete the insurance application and be insured for a longer amount of time!

It was a really great experience for me. Knowing that I can go there for some of my medical issues makes me feel empowered and in control of my finances and health.

Edit: Wow! I just wanted to share my experience. I never expected this to make the front page! Like, this is my second post ever, that's crazy to me! Thanks for everyone who commented support and care. And thanks for everyone who reached out through DM. I've read a lot of reddit posts talking about how to care and treat yeast infections, and tons more talking about the services that Planned Parenthood offers. I wanted to give more validity to those great services and I think it's great that you all have shared home remedies that have worked for you! Now other people like me can come back to the comments on this post when they may not know what else to do.

190,9s563m,2018-10-28,TwoXChromosomes,UPDATE: My husband is not bonding with our 5 week old son.,"Last night I called the firestation and talked to a firefighter about my husbands strange behavior since our son was born. With my husbands history of head trauma, he was a boxer from 12 to 28, I was concerned. They sent an ambulance.

The paramedics evaluated him and told me something wasn't right. They decided to take him to the hospital. We've been there all night while my husband was getting scanned and tested. They did all kinds of tests involving memory, they used flashcards, and mental quizzes and puzzles.

I'm in shock as to how bad my husband's mental state is. It's embarrassing I didn't notice how far he had declined. Maybe I didn't want to notice? Maybe it was a conscious decision? 

I watched him struggle name his hometown. He had lived there the first 22 years of his life. He couldn't do it. Mother's name, father's name. He struggled with answering the most basic questions.

I had noticed in recent years he talked about the past less and less. He rarely tells stories about his past anymore. I didn't know that it was because he, basically, doesn't have a past anymore. All those pictures around the house hold no real meaning for him. He doesn't remember our first kiss, when he proposed to me, or very much about our wedding. He knows these things happened, but the specifics of those events are lost to him.

A psychiatrist met with him, but she wasn't very helpful. She kept asking him about suicide. My husband isn't suicidal. She asked him misleading questions like she was trying to trick him into being suicidal. When I brought up how my husband hasn't bonded with our son she waved me off and told me she had rounds.

The neurologist is awesome. He really cares.

My husband's boss and some coworkers came this morning. They were more honest with me today than I think nthey have been in a long time. My husband hasn't been a trainer in 2 years. He used to go and get trained on all thye new JD technology and then train the other techs. It got to the point he couldn't do it anymore. He also has notebooks filled with notes and procedures he should know by heart. They're like his crutches so he can do his job. He rarely goes on field calls alone anymore, he usually takes someone with him. 

I met with a counselor that the neurology department employs to help patient's families deal with the fallout. She told me to prepare to take on more and more of the responsibilities around the house. It's a worry because my husband is the bread winner and I can't replace his income on my skills and education. She explained that patients with the trauma my husband has exist on routine. When something disrupts that routine, like a new baby, they often can't cope.

My husband is staying for a few more days. Tomorrow he meets with a different psychiatrist and then is being transferred to a more advanced neurology center 3 hours away. With a little luck I'll have a more definitive care plan and have him home by Wednesday or Thursday.

192,cud2yy,2019-08-23,TwoXChromosomes,Becoming a mother changed my views on abortion,"I grew up in a pro-life environment. I repeated the “life begins at conception” line without really understanding it. Then I got married and started trying to get pregnant and I learned a lot more about how female reproduction works. 

I struggled with low fertility, so I began researching to see if there was anything I could do to improve our chances of conceiving. I learned that sometimes it’s not a problem of getting the egg fertilized, it’s a problem getting the fertilized egg to implant. I learned about “false positives” AKA chemical pregnancy when a fertilized egg (blastocyst) implants and begins to raise the pregnancy hormones, but then is shed in the following period. Normally a woman wouldn’t even suspect that she had been briefly pregnant, but someone trying to conceive might catch it on an early response home pregnancy test. 

In the middle of all of this new information that I was trying to absorb to figure out how to have a baby, I kept coming back to the “life begins at conception” line that I’d been taught all my life. I decided that it must be wrong because if pregnancy doesn’t begin at conception (there’s an average of 6-12 days between conception and implantation which I had been previously unaware of), then life doesn’t either. So I began opening my mind to birth control that prevents implantation and accepted that that was probably a reasonable way to allow women to have some control over their fertility. (This might sound obvious, and it should be, but for someone who believes that life begins at conception, preventing implantation is still ending that life, and I was taught that the birth control pill was just another form of abortion.)

Praise the Lord, I finally got pregnant. Then a whole new nightmare awaited me. Pregnancy SUCKS!!!! In addition to the myriad physical discomforts, there’s also the mental strain. Your body no longer feels like yours. Everything becomes about the baby. Everything you eat or don’t eat (and how much!) revolves around what is best for the baby. Everything you do or don’t do has to be evaluated in the context of what is best for the baby. Then there’s the hormones. Besides the usual moodiness and volatility, I also suffered from pregnancy-related depression. I felt like a prisoner in my mind and body. 

The only thing that got me through was thinking of this precious baby that I wanted so much and had worked so hard to get.  This brought me back to the abortion question. How inhumane is it to force this on another person who doesn’t want it and doesn’t intend to keep the baby! I’d always heard it discussed as, “Don’t kill the baby! Just go through with it and give it up for adoption!” As if carrying a baby to term is no big deal. 

I began to really question whether the real purpose was to punish the woman for getting pregnant in the first place, and it didn’t take me long to decide that was definitely part of it. “If she didn’t want a baby, she shouldn’t have gotten pregnant in the first place.” “Maybe this will teach her to be more responsible.”etc.. (Disclaimer: I’ve never personally known someone who got pregnant and wanted an abortion and was prevented from getting one, though I imagine that situation is about to become much more common. These are generic comments that I’ve heard during discussions about abortion in general, rather than things I’ve heard said about a specific person.)

That was all that it took to change my mind about early abortions. I have since had another baby and I kind of agree with some arguments I’ve read that there is hardly any personhood or consciousness in a newborn baby. That doesn’t mean that I support partial birth abortion, but I have moved my goalposts from “okay in the first trimester” to “okay as long as the baby is not viable outside the womb”. I still believe that life is precious, and I believe that if a pregnancy has progressed to the point of the baby being able to survive outside the womb, then there should be every effort made to allow it to live. [Edit to clarify that I still support having the baby removed if that’s what the mother wants because it’s her body, but a viable baby should be given medical care necessary to live the same as any other pre-term baby. I’m sure this will be a relatively rare situation anyway.] What I no longer believe is that an unborn baby should have equal rights with its mother. An unborn baby is becoming a person, but it’s not yet. Actual people who have already been born should be prioritized above a person-in-progress.

Having resolved the moral aspect of it for myself, I finally began to understand and be horrified by the ways that denying a woman an abortion could impact her mental health and education and relationships and career. It is inexcusable to me to allow this disproportionate punishment to the woman when she was not alone in conceiving the baby. Add onto that the horror of some people actually arguing against allowing abortions to rape victims, and I finally feel the rage that I’ve seen in other pro-choice people. I finally understand. It’s barbaric to deny women the *right* to choose what happens to *their own bodies*!

TL/DR: Unlike others I’ve heard who say that becoming a parent made them support abortion less, becoming a parent took me from vehemently pro-life to extremely pro-choice.",StoneOfFire,t2_3idbdrdc,0.78,28022,1132
195,m1pzdl,2021-03-10,TwoXChromosomes,Piers Morgan is a public example of why women are afraid to say no to men.,"Notable observations and timeline of events:

1) **His hatred of Meghan stems from rejection.** 

According to Piers in 2018, he really liked Meghan Markle and spent time getting drinks with her one night. That same night she met Harry at a party and then ""ghosted"" Piers ever since.
 
2) **He was continuously given a platform to spew hatred about Meghan.** 

Piers spent YEARS vilifying Meghan on television and in tabloids. He more recently accused her of lying about being suicidal after she admitted the public bullying from UK tabloids negatively impacted her mental health. Yet, it took only a few SECONDS of criticism to send Piers storming off of his own show in a fit of rage.

3) **It took another man standing up for Meghan to finally get Piers off the air.** 

Despite 40,000+ complaints from viewers about Piers after his diatribe accusing Meghan and Harry of lying in their interview with Oprah, it took his male co-host confronting Piers on air to finally shut him up. His co-host defended Meghan's right to cut off contact with Piers, which angered him and sent him storming off the show. According to the network, despite the complaints and his repeated vicious behavior toward Meghan, he was still given the opportunity to step down on his own volition.

196,ccizyn,2019-07-13,TwoXChromosomes,You just don't know until it happens to you,"In February, I (32 f) was at a gas station after work and saw a guy knock his girlfriend out. He did it in front of everyone at a busy gas station in Baltimore.

Without thinking, I jumped out of my car and screamed at the guy to get the fuck away from her unconscious body. He immediately tried to pick her up and apologize, but when I started to call the cops, he swung at me. Grazed my jaw.

I got in my car and locked the doors. I tried to take video, but I couldn't while on the phone with the police. So I took as many pictures as I could.

This man dragged her body to his car, shook her awake, and made her come and tell me to stop calling the cops. I didn't. So, then, he tried to break into my passenger side door. I backed up to leave, so then he sat on the hood of my car. I managed to drive off without running him over (despite the desire).

Shocking, yes? But, wait, there's more. The majority of my call with 911 during the incident was arguing whether I was in Baltimore City or County. I lived in that neighborhood and knew it was in the city. Still, she transferred me to the county dispatch.

County police arrived and said it was city. But was able to pull his license plate info to help me identify him. After about an hour, the city police arrived, took a report, told me that I need to file charges, and said he will check out the surveillance footage.

I assumed that the state would pursue this incident automatically. I assumed my photos and the surveillance footage would be enough for the state to file charges related to assaulting his girlfriend, assaulting me, trying to break into my car, trying to intimidate me, etc. I assumed the evidence would be damning that I wouldn't have to do anything else. I assumed wrong.

I had to file an assault charge. Me. I had to show up to court as the plaintiff. Me. I had to bring up to the prosecutor the fact that he was already on probation/parole for a previous assault charge. Me. I had take 3 days off work for the district court hearing, the initial circuit court hearing, and the trial. Me. I was the sole witness because no surveillance footage was acquired (for reasons unknown). Me.

Today was the trial. And, about 30 minutes ago, I got the call from the court that he was found guilty. He will be sentenced next Friday.

I bring this all up not because I want to brag about how I put an abuser behind bars. (Ironically, my current job before I go off to law school is providing civil legal services to people who are incarcerated. And, I don't see jail or prison as the best option for many). I bring this up because I never truly understood what it meant for someone to press charges against an abuser. Until now.

It means navigating a system that is tragically overwhelmed and jaded. It means having one of the worst things that has happened to you be treated like a day at the DMV.

Going to court the first time, I had to wait in the hall alongside this man. The second time, I had to pass him twice in the hall to find out I was supposed to be across the street in a completely different building for victims and witnesses. No one told me this. The third time, I was waiting alone in the hall for my moment to testify while they were on break. And, he walked past me in the hall back into the court room.

Each of those times, I felt myself reeling. The term revictimized had a more profound meaning. Not to mention how I had to endure being cross examined by his attorney, who was trying her hardest to make my story seem as if I was the instigator in my assault.

The thing is that I was not especially injured. I did not know this man. And, I feel confident that our paths will never cross again.

But, all I could do was imagine what this experience is like for victims of rape, domestic violence, or something else more violent and personal. The courage it takes to go through all this when the stakes are even higher is underappreciated. And, the reality of not wanting to file charges and not wanting to go through all this is overzealously criticized.

To all of you out there who have had to stand up and fight, I hear you and applaud you. And, I'm sorry you had to go through it, especially if you had to do it all alone. Having someone there to hold your hand makes all the difference.

To all of you out there who did not pursue action, I hear you too. I get why people don't report or take action. And, I'm sorry our system doesn't support you better.

Edit: I'm overwhelmed with support here. Thank you! For some reason, I am not getting access to every single comment, which I am trying to read and respond to accordingly. I'm sorry to anyone I couldn't.

For those of you who have asked for a link or proof that this is the truth, I have two things to say to you:

1. I understand wanting to get more information, but if your motivation is to verify my story (as some have overtly stated), you are part of the problem. Many victims don't report because of the fear of not being believed.

2. I already feel that I have provided too much information that a reasonable person could do this on their own. In fact, I'm a little worried that this post has gotten so much attention that if someone were to find the offender's information from the case docket, they'd be harassed, which may result in further violence or harassment on my part or another.

Any advice on this would be welcome, as he is not going to be incarcerated until his sentencing date.",Drewyong,t2_221v62k5,0.89,27811,578
198,62moof,2017-03-31,TwoXChromosomes,"To the woman who made sure I was okay, even though I was perfectly fine. Thank you.","My dad and I were walking on the street. We were speaking Portuguese, we naturally speak loud but we were having a somewhat heated conversation about someone and we were probably louder than usual. I was late at night, so you might not have seen the whole scene properly, but you probably saw an older man talking to a younger women loudly in a language that you didn't understand that has a harsh sound to it. 

What made you react was probably the fact that my dad does this ""elbow"" thing when he's proving a point. He will take his elbow and ""hit"" me with it. It doesn't hurt me at all, but I was wearing high heels and lost a bit of my balance when he elbowed me since I wasn't expecting it. He apologized and caught me but you were there. 

You came in running from behind saying ""hello, excuse me."" We turned around and you looked at me straight in the eyes and told me ""You look identical to this girl I went to high school with from behind. I'm pretty sure it's you, do you remember me?"" I was a bit confused, and told her ""uh..."" Before I said more she said ""Maybe it wasn't you. I'm not sure it's dark, but she was a good friend and there is nothing I'd like more than to reconnect with her."" I smiled and said ""I don't think it's me."" She just said ""Okay, cool, well my name is Emilie, and I can leave you my phone number if ever you remember me."" As she gave me a big smile. It clicked in my head, this girl was just making sure I was okay. 

I smiled back and told her that I got it now, and thanked her. I told her that I was okay and that I was talking with my dad about something that upset both of us in Portuguese. We laughed it off and she mentioned how harsh Portuguese sounds and we went separate ways. My dad didn't understand what happened and thinks it's some girl thing. We resumed our discussion as soon as she left. 

So to that Emilie Montreal woman who made sure I was okay, you did everything right. If I was in a situation where I was being vulnerable, you gave me many ways out. You've inspired me. Thank you. ",carlinha1289,t2_5i7ml,0.76,27704,594

202,8r1xs3,2018-06-14,TwoXChromosomes,"I stashed a tampon in my bra. Later, things went horribly wrong, then horribly right.","I know the content here is generally more sober in tone, but, well, I need to tell this story.

This happened yesterday, the day of an excessively important meeting in which I needed to convince the executive team at my company that the website I manage should be the next one in line to get a redesign.

Incidentally, the ol' uterus had done me the favor of double-booking my day with the initiation of its monthly lining-purge, and for the better part of the morning I found myself wincing as it crampily complained about how pregnant I wasn't.

About an hour prior to the meeting, I felt a familiar but unpleasant sensation in my nether regions and suspected that I might have sprung a leak. I hastily excavated a tampon from my satchel and, lacking pockets, tucked it into my bra to prevent my coworkers from seeing it as I hustled to the bathroom.

It turned out to be a phantom leak, so all business proceeded as usual, and the tampon in my bra remained unused. Unfortunately, by the time I made my way back to my office, schmoozing with the occasional coworker on the way, I had entirely forgotten that it was there.

As the meeting time approached, I was feeling confident. I had done my research, assembled a glorious and stylish presentation with rock-solid data to support my argument, rehearsed my spiel, and psyched myself up with some assertive body language exercises. I had this. Immovable decision-makers, meet unstoppable go-getter.

I strutted into the meeting ready to win the day. Distributing habitually firm handshakes to the white-haired businessmen around the conference table with a jaunty joke here and there, I made my way to the front of the room and started hooking my laptop up to the projector.

To my endless dismay, that was the moment my hidden tampon decided to make an appearance. It had slipped out of my bra, and I felt it graze my belly as it plummeted toward hem of my loose-fitting shirt.

If I had been thinking, I might have let it drop to the floor and kicked it under the table where it would have most likely gone unnoticed until the end of the meeting. But no such luck.

Instead, I tried to catch it as it fell out of my shirt.

And instead of catching it, I swatted it -- an impeccable under-hand serve that sent my tampon soaring, with all the grace of a badminton birdie, directly into the center of the oak conference table, where it landed with a loud *phlatt*.

All eyes in the room descended upon it as the smalltalk came to a record-scratching halt. Then all eyes turned upon me. A years-long silence followed in which I prayed for a sudden aneurysm.

Suddenly remembering how to move, I lunged across the table and snatched it up.

In an uncharacteristic fit of charm, I grinned, raised the tampon up to the projection like a pointer, and said, ""Now that I have your undivided attention, let's get started.""

Fortunately, that was enough to make one of them chuckle. Despite the deep discomfort on some of their faces, the laugh broke the spell and allowed me to proceed with the presentation.

And all-in-all, the presentation went well, and I was approved for my redesign. So it could have been far worse.

But that won't stop my scumbag brain from kicking me with that particular memory every time I'm trying to fall asleep for the next month or so.

TL;DR Silenced a room full of my company's old male executives by flopping my tampon on the conference table.

Edit: The exec who laughed just popped into my office to ask what I'm planning to throw at them today. I'm never going to live this down.

Within seconds of me and my friend sitting down, the slimeball left. It's hard to say why, because the two of us are very small, unintimidating people. I think maybe he realized he wasn't wanted there, or that he couldn't take us four to one.

These gals were really grateful and the four of us chatted for a while until we were sure he was gone.

206,nppdaq,2021-06-01,TwoXChromosomes,I caught my worthless husband cheating and I feel great,"He’s been sexting with a coworker and they planned to meet up. He’s signed up with at least 4 dating sites. I woke up this morning with eyes so puffy they were almost swollen shut. Then I realized that I don’t have to put up with his constantly shitty mood anymore. I don’t have to do all the emotional labor. I don’t have to do jack shit for him. I feel absolutely nothing for him and all of his sobbing and snot and apologies. There is just this huge void where are my love and caring for him used to be.
I feel SO free.

I’m not sure if this is just relief or dissociation, though. So I’m gonna join a gym, eat healthy, buy some new panties and upgrade my ancient hitachi magic wand. Any advice or recommendations are appreciated!




Edit: I really can’t express how much your words mean to me. I am so sorry so many of you have gone/are going through this pain. Thank you all so much!

To touch on a few common questions, he’s slept on a recliner for two days. As much as I’d like to throw him out and serve him with divorce papers today, I really have to be cautious for now so that he’ll continue to be cooperative. I am 100% sure we’ll be divorced, though. I’m looking into therapy for myself and my two kids and contact a lawyer ASAP. I have no intention of dating anyone until all of this is over and I’ve had a shit ton of therapy.

For the handful of people who cared about his reasoning (and I sure as fuck don’t) he said he felt old and fat. He hates himself and any attention he got from these women was an ego boost. Every time we talk now he cries.  He sobs and I feel just completely emptiness in the part of me that used to care. I suspect maybe it has something to do with his diabetes, super low testosterone, and ED. But again, not my problem.

I bought the cute undies and Satisfyer 2 Pro plus. I’m looking into the other vibes mentioned. I’m sure I’m gonna have the best sex of my life with myself soon!

Edit 2: The comment about the testosterone really upset a couple guys. I never shamed him about his health problems, if anything I was too accommodating. So I’ll give you an example of how exhausting the relationship was. He never gave himself the shots. Whatever, some people don’t like needles. I’d give him the shot then he’d be cranky with me for the rest of the night because his leg hurt. He’d say I did it wrong this time. I was the one setting a reminder on my phone for every two weeks. We’d run out of syringes, he wouldn’t buy more. I’d mention it, he’d ignore me. His medicine would expire, I’d mention it, and he wouldn’t go to the doctor for a refill. On and on, over and over. He wouldn’t let me give him the shot unless he felt absolutely terrible. Now imagine the situation I mentioned repeating in every other facet of our lives. He wasn’t always like this. But this is who he is now.

Edit 3: I’m going to make an appointment for an STD check. Ugh.
The only reason I found out is because he gave me his phone to charge. It was sitting right next to my tablet in my field of vision when a message popped up. It said something about “getting chills thinking about our meeting.” I thought it was spam. But then a minute later, “are you still there?” So I asked him and he said he didn’t know. He looked at it for a minute and handed the phone back to me to charge it. I saw that he had deleted the messages. Then I just knew. So I logged into our cellphone account and saw 189 messages between them from that night. He finally admitted it. I guess he had just talked to her that night but he’s apparently been trying to cheat with women online for 4-5 weeks.",Lushmelts,t2_53cudiv4,0.84,27465,1002

She left my dad when I was 7 and let him have custody of us due to her being unable to take care of us. She never asked for anything from him except her freedom. For years he told us she didn’t love us, and how horrible a person she was. She never contacted us, at least that's what he told us so we believed him. Turns out, he gave her a bunch of ridiculous rules about being in contact with us, and because she felt so much guilt about leaving us and him raising us on his own, she wanted to respect his boundaries and rules. She emailed us many times, but he never told us about any of them (one of the rules my dad had was as long as we were minors, all contact had to be through him, she showed me the emails she sent to us through him). When I turned 18, she got in contact with me directly, and we started talking. I went to visit her and, after many long conversations, I moved in with her and her husband two months ago.

I went from a child believing my mom didn’t love me to being an adult who now understands that my father actually let me believe that because to him, his feelings were more important than mine. I'm so angry at him because he caused actual emotional and mental harm to my brother and myself by telling us our mom didn't love us. She didn't chose him, so he told us she didn't want us. He was unable to separate his relationship with her from our relationship with her as her children. He thought that the best revenge on her was to make us not love her, because he never stopped to realize that it was his children who were the ones who actually paid the price for his lies. We still loved her, we just hated ourselves.

I know he did his best. He made sure we always had a roof over our head and food in our belly; we went on vacations, never lacked for a lot, monetarily. But he still let us believe that our own mother didn't love us because she was brain damaged and mentally ill, and she wasn't capable of taking care of us financially. She believed giving him full custody was in our best interest even if it broke her heart. She didn't want us to feel like we had to choose between the two of them.

215,j7qyhv,2020-10-09,TwoXChromosomes,I'm fucking terrified of Amy Coney Barrett,"This happened nearly ten years ago when I was in high school but I came out to a pastor, He raped me, because it would supposedly make me not gay. I didn't tell anyone because I was too scared of being outed. My parents definitely would have kicked me out.

Two months later, I found out I was pregnant. I didn't know anything about abortion except that it was murder. I didn't have health insurance, and it's not exactly easy to get one as a minor anyways. I was too scared to talk to my parents about it. So I went to the internet to figure out how to force a miscarriage. It took several attempts, and I'll spare the details, but I woke up to a bloody mess that still haunts me.

That pastor is still at my family's church, preaching to vulnerable kids, claiming God loves them, that abortion is wrong, and that i would have deserved to go to hell. I haven't been back since I turned 18, but I still feel extremely guilty about the possibility he's abused anyone else.

I'm now a PhD student in a stem field. I don't think this would have happened if I was forced to have my rapist's child.

Now that RBG is gone, and Amy Coney Barrett is up to replace her, I'm terrified for other people who would have to go through what I went through to get abortions in times of crisis. I feel so hopeless. But I'm going to keep fighting because that's the legacy RBG left behind.

Beating up the masked rapist who pulled the pretty lady into the bushes, who will in turn be forever grateful and fall in love with you. Chasing off the robber who wanted to steal the nice grandma's handbag. Many versions of saving the damsel in distress. It's natural to want to see yourself like that. It's pretty cool to be the hero.

When in reality ""making women feel safe in public"" is something different 9,5 out of 10 times. It's being ""no fun"" and calling out your male buddies or other men who make misogynist jokes or make women uncomfortable. It's ""cockblocking"" a buddy who wants to take home a drunk girl. It's not hitting on women when it is inappropriate no matter how pretty you find them and how blue your balls are. It's making sure a female friend gets home safely. It's meddling. It's being a nag. Ultimately it's confronting and risking to anger or annoy other men, especially men you like or are friends with and sometimes sacrificing that friendship. It costs something. And it is not rewarded with women being so grateful they reward you with sex. And that is much harder to imagine and do than acting out white knight fantasies.

I was too scared to call out for help. If I called out for help and it didn't work, he'd be even angrier at me. This was my survival instinct kicking in.

As my husband dragged me in a headlock through the parking lot towards our car, I struggled to escape his grasp, hoping someone would notice and care. 

You noticed, and more importantly, you cared enough to do something.

My husband is a large intimidating man. You are an average, somewhat timid looking man. As you held the hand of your little son, it must have crossed your mind that intervening could be dangerous and would certainly be uncomfortable. 

""Hey! You can't do that dude"". 

Your voice stopped not only my husband in his tracks, but several other nearby patrons. My hope of rescue began to build.

""Fuck off bro, this is my wife"".

My husband quickened his pace. The car was 15 feet away. Fear sunk back into my heart. 

""I don't care who she is, you can't do that.""

My husband was extremely irritated at you. Perhaps even considering assaulting you. But then he started to feel the spotlight that was falling on him. More patrons were paying attention, some in their cars rolling down their window, some stopping in the parking lot to assess the situation.

It was enough. It was all I needed. My husband let go of me, got in the car and was gone. You went on with your day, surely unaware of the impact you just made on my life. 

What you didn't know is that I'd been trapped in the abusive relationship for years and that my husband had become absolutely unhinged in the last couple of days, showing levels of violence and anger I'd never seen in him.

What you didn't know is that for the previous 32 hours he had kept me from my phone, my computer, my car, and any contact with anyone.

The only reason he risked taking me in public was because the income tax return was in my name and he wanted me to cash it for him. I honestly expected him to kill me afterwards.

Minutes after you saved my life, I borrowed another stranger's phone and called the police and my mother. 

Finally, I am free. 

Thank you, stranger.

For context, this bill will also lessen restrictions on what formula can be accessed by WIC and other federal assistance programs recipients. From a similar post on r/feminism, "" Earlier on Wednesday, Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) sent a memo to all House GOP offices recommending that members vote against the legislation. ""  


192 Republicans voted against a bill to help feed infants. The same infants they want you, as women, to be forced to have.

Blowing off  the lack of holidays in the Congregationalist calendar (esp. compared to Catholic) as an amorphous ""Protestant work ethic"" rather than Americans just not expecting everything to shut down for St. Jewkiller's Day (but having much stronger protections for Yom Kippur) and that only being applicable to the holiday rather than vacation count was one. Another was missing the centrality of the self-employed to American narratives, as smallhold farmers can't take paid vacations (more on this later).  
More problematically, what little discussion of pre-80's European factors there is takes them as plausible factors. Somehow 1920's pensions and the NHS starting in the 1940's only started having policy implications in 1980 (and that's besides the fact that American healthcare and access only really started diverging in the 1990's and Americans are still happy with the current retirement regime). It also ignores what was going on legislatively around the period, as America was passing a ton of worker protections in the manner of antidiscrimination rules that in Europe are various mixes of later, less comprehensive/strict, or treated as between the worker and his employer. The ADA, passed in 1990, is still a real point of pride for Americans. The 1980's is also when small business and self-employment were being defined as America's unique driver of innovation and success in domestic politics.",scolfin,t2_11zjwg,0.91,1599,677

But I just wanted to stop by to remind you all of some things that I wish someone had told me growing up--","You are likely not going to find a ""soulmate"" in high school or even college, don't fret, just focus on your studies, they're more important than you believe right now.

Relationships are going to end, but that doesn't mean your life does. A boyfriend or girlfriend that doesn't work out is not the end of the world it's a learning experience. Even if it was a terrible breakup, and they cheated on you with your best friend or something (maybe even worse). Guess what, you just got the opportunity to cut TWO toxic fuckbags out of your life. FOR THE BETTER! Life goes on and I guarantee you that you will find someone that deserves your attention and effort and love. 

Which brings me to my next point, don't try to please everyone, ESPECIALLY people in the same situation as you, ie. your peers. You don't need to be the most popular kid in your school, you don't need to impress anyone. As much as it may feel like everyone is watching you, they're worried about making the same mistakes as you. So you tripped on something and some dick heads laughed at you... So what, it's not the end of the world and I can promise you that they've made the same dumb mistakes too. PEOPLE FUCK UP. Everyone does stupid stuff and everyone gets laughed at for it, sure it may bring you some embarrassment or shame, but that's easily forgotten.

And to my final point, because I feel like I'm just letting diarrhea spew out of my mouth hole at this juncture, (sorry, had a really bad day and a lot is on my mind), high-school is not your final destination. 4 years may seem like a lot, but it goes by quicker than you think and by the end of it, all of those dick heads, bullies, and horrible relationships will be stuck where they are. When you're done with school, you're done. You probably won't ever see those people again in your life, even if you're in the same town. It's amazing how big life gets after school. Don't give up, and for God's sake please don't let someone else foolish actions make you decide to end your own life. Life gets better after school because it becomes YOUR life. No more (classic) bullies, no more bullshit high-school drama filled half relationships, no teachers (professors in college are a whole different animal), and your stress level drops immensely.

My main point in this is that I keep seeing people younger and younger kill themselves over shit that really isn't as serious as it feels when you're young and your hormones are all sorts of out of whack. I've been there, I tried to kill myself several times in my life from 12 on after I lost my father, came really close twice. But I'm glad I didn't because I have an amazing daughter that makes life worth living. Life goes on, guys, and it does get better. One bad relationship, hell ten bad relationships isn't enough to end things, just breathe and believe in your future. Please don't end your life. You matter and you're important, and things get better.

Edit- hey, everyone! Thanks for reading my message, I'm glad I could help some of you out. I need to clarify somethings though, I'm not married TO kids, I'm married and I have children lol. Also, I do not subscribe to this subreddit, I find myself searching in Popular more than Home and this sub comes up CONSTANTLY.

So, without further ado, here are the three life skills I wish I’d learned before that happened.

&#x200B;

***How to manage money:***

This one is important and it can be the difference between you eating and not eating. If you find yourself on your own without a plan, an unexpected bill can really mess you up. I was hit by one not long after my 18th birthday when my car blew up and I basically didn’t have food for four days. Don’t be me, learn from my mistakes.

This is the system I came up with after that and it hasn’t failed me since:

1. Write down all your bills (other than rent) such as phone, internet, electricity, car insurance etc. These will all be billed at different intervals so break them down into weeks.

>E.g. if your internet is $40 per month, that’s roughly $10 per week.

Once all of your bills are in weeks, add them up to figure out how much money you need to put aside per week to pay them. If you are paid weekly, great! Put that amount aside in a bank account called *\_BILLS\_* as soon as you get paid. If you are paid fortnightly, double it and do the same thing. It’s not rocket science, but it works.

2. Rent! No one wants to be homeless, so this is pretty damn important. Honestly, I should move it to #1 but I’m lazy.

Same as *BILLS*, put this aside in a bank account called *RENT* as soon as you are paid. If you are paid weekly, put one week’s worth aside. If you are paid fortnightly, put two weeks worth aside. You get the picture.

Note: there is an added bonus to doing it like this. If your landlord ever tries to say you missed a payment, you have all of your dated transactions in one easily searchable account. One of my landlords once lost a week of my rent and tried to bill me for it a second time. With good records you can tell them to ~~go fuck themselves~~ take a hike.

For both *RENT* and *BILLS* use automatic transfers or direct debits where possible. They make life easier, save time, and you’ll never miss a payment.

*Money Part 2: Electric Boogaloo*

Now that you’ve done that, you have an idea of what’s left over after you get paid. We aren’t done yet though. You don’t have a savings account or an “oh fuck” account. Let’s fix that.

3. Oh, fuck: your crazy housemate pissed in the fridge, slashed your tyres, and what’s worse, drank your milk without replacing it. Jokes on them though, you pissed in the milk first. Still, what an asshole.

However it happens, sometimes shit just goes wrong. That’s when you need an *Oh, Fuck*^(TM) account.

Look at any weekly expenses you have left, these will most likely be groceries and petrol/gas plus a few other random things. Total those up and use them as a baseline to give yourself a weekly “wage”. Anything above this, put into your *Oh Fuck* account until you have enough to last a couple of months if shit really hits the fan.

Now that you’ve done that, never touch this account unless you really bloody well have to. Have it with a different bank if necessary, and definitely do not have a card linked to it. This is your lifeline, don’t waste it on a bloody sofa (or a clean one, for that matter).

4. You thought we were done? Haha, nah fam. Being an adult is long and tedious. Next up is *SAVINGS*. Once you have gotten your *Oh Fuck* account to an acceptable level start putting most of your excess here instead. This is the account you will use for new shoes & clothes (you fucking Diva) or luxuries like entertainment and other non essential items.

It’s okay to spend from this account where necessary, but for any bigger purchases wait a week or so and see if you still want it. People have shit judgement when they impulse buy, and statistically you and I are no different. Yay?

5. General Account: this is the account you get paid into, and the account you weep over as you transfer away bills, rent, savings, and *Oh Fuck* money. The only money you want in here is your weekly wage (mentioned above). If you don’t get paid weekly and tend to eat into next week’s wage, consider keeping next week’s wage in your savings account until the new week. Anything left over at the end of the pay cycle should be moved to Savings or *Oh Fuck* depending on what you’re trying to build up.

7. Bonus: this isn’t a big one, but I like it. Every time you want to order takeaway, cook instead and earmark the money you would have spent as guilt free **you** money. It adds up surprisingly quickly and you can use it to buy things that you’ll enjoy more in the long term.

&#x200B;

***How to cook (properly):***

This one should be obvious, but eating out is really expensive long term. If your parents are any good at cooking, ask them to teach you before you move out. The earlier the better, trust me. I was half decent, but I wish I’d learned a lot more.

If they aren’t, the internet is an amazing resource. I recommend buying one GOOD knife rather than a set of knives and some stainless steel pots. Treat them well and they will last you forever. Non stick are convenient, but you can say goodbye if a metal utensil even looks at them funny. Hot oil in a hot stainless steel pan = non stick anyway.

General cooking tips:-Onions and garlic are you friends, they are cheap but make things taste less poor.

* Frozen vegetables are just as nutritious as fresh ones and don’t turn into a pile of slush at the back of your fridge if you forget about them.
* Fuck instant noodles, they aren’t as cheap as you think they are. Memes aside, they aren’t worth it.
* Rice is cheap in 5kg sacks and lasts you ages. Use two cups of water for every one cup of rice. Bring it to the boil, then turn the stove off and forget about it for 20 minutes with a lid on. Bam, perfect fucking rice every fucking time.
* Eggs are a godsend. Cheap, filling, and really damn good for you. Eat when possible.
* Canned beans (eg kidney beans) are also a godsend. Cheap as hell, and you can add them to things like curries or pasta sauce to add protean and bulk them out.
* Spices are literally the spice of life. Get a whole bunch and never look back.
* You can buy big cheap bottles of pasta sauce for less than $2 and make them nice by frying some onion and garlic first and cooking some veggies and beans in them for a while.
* Make big meals and freeze the extras if you have space. It really helps on the days you’re exhausted by life.

&#x200B;

***No one cares about you (and that’s a good thing)***

Hear me out here. I was so self conscious when I first moved out of home that I was terrified of looking like an idiot. I never had a dad so I put off buying fucking shaving cream and a razor in case I got the “wrong(?)” ones and the clerk thought I was stupid or something. Speaking to my female friends, they detailed similar stories about buying feminine hygiene essentials. Plot twist: outside of a few friends and family members no one gives a shit about you. The Clerk will forget you exist after about five minutes, and if your friends give you crap you can just get better friends.

I know this one is easier said than done, but try and keep things in perspective. What’s the worst that could happen? Usually it’s actually nothing. They don’t care if you buy shaving cream or pads, and if someone thinks you look weird crawling around for a good photo, fuck em. Your photos are probably better than theirs anyway.

&#x200B;

So uh, yeah, that’s it. Those are the three things I wish I’d known before getting kicked out of home: no one cares about you, cooking is good (and might even land you a girlfriend/boyfriend), and managing money is important. Who’da thunk it.

&#x200B;

**Edits:** 

I'm really glad this seems to be reaching the people who need it, or will need it. I just came back to 300+ comments so do forgive me for answering some common questions here:

>Where are you from? 

Here I was thinking that all the swearing would have given me away. Maybe I should have said brah or cunt, but I tend to avoid the latter since it is an absolute cunt of a word. Anyway, If you ask that I'll have to hand you a Vegemite sandwich. Don't tempt me, its a national sport for us.

>Are you doing better now? 

Yes, thanks for asking! I completed my university studies mid this year whereupon I graduated into a global pandemic. Or didn't, since we weren't allowed to have graduations... Still, I'm proud of myself.

>How will cooking get me a girlfriend/boyfriend?

Worked for me. I had a housemate going through hard times so I always ""accidentally"" cooked extra so she could have some. She knew I was full of it of course, and she still does. Worst comes to worst, you can have a nice meal to cry alone over ~~just like old times~~. Basically, no warranties, guarantees or batteries included with this one.

486,exk4v7,2020-02-02,teenagers,"Well r/teenagers, it’s been a fun ride. After today I will officially be 20 years old. To celebrate the milestone, here’s 20 bits of advice I wish I had when I had just become a teenager (turning 13)","1. Being a teenager is hard as fuck; you find yourself in a state of flux where almost nobody will relate at all to you, whether they’re young or old. *This is okay.*

2. It’s gonna take a while for you to find who you really are. You probably won’t start settling on a solid persona until you hit 16-18.

3. What seems permanent right now is most likely just a phase, even though you said how much it really is you forever now.

4. That doesn’t mean resist what you want to do because it’s just a phase. Embrace the weird stuff. Listen to death metal. Watch anime. Paint your nails. Wear crazy neon colors that don’t match. Do it. And take lots of pictures when you do. It’ll be hilarious later.

5. Talk to your crush. Ask her out. It’s okay to be nervous, just don’t be weird.

6. It helps if you get to know her as a person a little bit before making your move, and at least make it *seem* like you have a sense of self-respect. Clean up after yourself, look/smell clean, and for fuck’s sake, don’t seem like you’re desperate.

7. **Make some goddamn friends.** It absolutely sucks to look back on most of your high school experience and realize that all you did was play video games, watch anime, and jerk off the entire time. All that will do is make you feel depressed and worthless. (You’re still gonna feel that way regardless, but at least you’ll have someone to talk about it with)

8. Find some people that you can relate to. If you’re a nerd who likes to talk about anime, science, and video games, try talking to the quiet kid or something.

9. Sit in the *back of every fucking class*. If you’re lucky you can snack, use your phone, and draw dicks on the table all year without the teacher noticing.

10. In a few years. you’re either gonna find a lot of formerly cool shit right to be cringy as fuck, or you’re going to *be* cringy as fuck. Try to be the first one.

11. Learn to laugh at your cringeworthy moments, and learn from your true mistakes.

12. Talk to the janitor. Learn his/her name. Use it.

13. Talk to the security guards. Find out which ones are the cool ones. Trust me, I’ve gotten out of *so much shit* just because I had a security guard cover my ass.

14. Join clubs. If you don’t like them, don’t go, but at least try a few and see if you can get involved. Same goes with after-school activities.

15. If you’re gonna fuck, **get some fucking protection.**

16. If you’re gonna smoke weed, **get some fucking snacks, and do it with people that you like.**

17. If you’re not primarily focused on academics, getting a part-time job to earn some cash is literally one of the best things you can do while still in school.

18. That doesn’t mean “get all ‘C’s and work at McDonalds”. Your academics are important and your performance in school should be a priority.

19. Getting a license and a car is **SO FUCKING WORTH IT.** Your world opens up like ten times over when you suddenly have the capability to drive anywhere you want to go. If you’re the guy/girl with a ride, it’s super easy to cement yourself as the “pack leader” for your friend group. Plus it’s going to set you up for success after you graduate.

20. More than anything, live life how you really want, on your terms. Don’t bottle yourself up and hide who you really are. You’re a special, one-of-a-kind human being and there won’t ever be another person like you ever again. You are made up of the essence of a thousand dying stars, and you have that same power to light up the world with what potential you have. Use it wisely.

504,eq7ywj,2020-01-17,teenagers,Responding to hate on the internet (my story),"Last year, I was scrolling through my Instagram feed, looking at my usual shitty memes, when I saw a comment that simply said ""Fuck the Jews, they control us all"". I didn't think much of it, since I'm used to seeing edgy 4chan shit online, but I decided to look to take a look at the account that posted it.

When I opened the account, all I saw were two kinds of posts; posts about depression and suicide, and wildly antisemitic posts. I'm a Jew, so I felt a combined sense of confusion (almost to a humorous point) and anger at what I saw. I was planning on commenting angrily on all of his antisemitic posts, but then I had an idea.

I remembered seeing a news story (still haven't found out if it's real or fake) about a black man who convinced hundreds of KKK members to leave the Klan by befriending them, and I wanted to see if I could replicate this. So, I kept the account in the back of my mind, periodically looking at his posts. One day, he put up a story asking if anyone wanted to be added to a groupchat to play Rainbow Six: Siege on PC. I decided to respond positively, so I could further my plan (and also because I really wanted to play R6 with someone).

Now, from my posts, it was pretty evident that I'm Jewish, so the first thing he replied was ""ok Jew"". I knew he wouldn't add me to a groupchat just for that reason, but surprisingly, he did. We all started playing R6 together, and this guy seemed to treat me normally, but he never called me by my name. It was always ""Good kill, Jew"" or ""Get on Discord, Jew"".

However, soon we grew closer, to the point where he shouted me out on his account, calling me ""the one good Jew to be born"". But I could tell that was always his sole impression of me. He only really identified me by my religion. I could also tell from his posts about depression that he likely suffered from it.

Then one day, at around 11:30 PM, as I was about to get off Instagram and go to sleep, I saw a new post from him. The photo was just some weird dark lo-fi art, and all the caption said was ""Killing myself, see you guys"".

Immediately, I got scared and instinctively began typing a message to him in his DMs. I thought it may all be in vain, and that he had maybe already done it. But I just couldn't stop typing. I couldn't bear to see another person die a needless death to depression, even if they didn't like my people. I don't wanna talk in specifics about what I said (it's very tough for me to write this now), but I concluded by telling him that, if his life didn't matter and nobody cared about him, why would a Jew, 300 miles away and 3 years younger (he's 19 I'm 16) even be trying to save his life.

After a rough night of sleep, I woke up and fearfully checked my DMs. All I saw from him was a photo and a message. The photo was just him smiling and doing a thumbs-up. In the message, he once again did not call me by my name. However, he didn't call me ""Jew"" either. All his message said was ""Thanks friend"".

He's now doing way better. He's since deleted all of his antisemitic posts, and we now like to discuss history and politics together (and of course play R6). He met his girlfriend soon after, who he is still with. And two days ago, he finally got his dream job: a designer for a small tabletop RPG company.

When confronted with hate on the internet, too many people let their emotions take control, and start flaming each other. Next time you see someone spreading prejudice online, even against a group that you are part of, do not fall into this habit. Instead, I challenge you to talk to them, and try to understand what they may be going through. You might change their mind, you might make a friend, and you might even save a life.

EDIT: Thank you kind stranger front page RIP inbox yadda yadda in all seriousness I love you guys and I really hope that you guys respond to hatred with kindness👍",mrprez180,t2_mxn6l,0.9,35859,1283

508,bd2hda,2019-04-14,teenagers,I’m a teacher that lurks here,"Well, as a teacher, let me tell you a little story...

I had a female student (I'm a male), who was rather attractive. Not gonna lie. But I would never pursue a student  romantically. Apparently, that feeling was not mutual. At first, things were like they usually were with stupid young girl crushing: double entendres, very subtle comments, etc. But there's a line, and she crossed it.

She wrote her number on an essay with a smiley face. This was not okay by any means. I immediately contacted an administrator so I wouldn't get in any trouble. These sorts of things are taken very seriously at pretty much any grade level these days, and I'm not interested in losing my job over some girl's hormones getting the best of her.

So a couple of days later, this administrator called a meeting with the parents. We were all in the office and the administrator was doing his spiel to the girl and her parents about appropriate behavior at school and appropriate age differences and the like (apparently this is a common enough issue that he had some training on how to have this kind of talk). She looked fairly ashamed, staring at the floor the whole time. He finished his rehearsed rant and then asked the parents if they had anything they wanted to say to the daughter. 

The father was silent, but the mother spoke up. She said something about how the girl should know better and how they taught her better than this, etc. The usual parent reprimand stuff. But teenage girls can often find ways to surprise you. The mom asked her daughter, ""And what did you even expect would come of something like this?"" My student was quiet for a moment, looking down at the floor still, but then she turned to me, and I will never forget the way she looked at me when she said it: ""About tree fiddy."" It was about this time I noticed that my student was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era. I said, ""Damn it, monsta, get out of this office! I ain't givin' you no damn tree fiddy!""",ologvinftw,t2_37co6byq,0.87,35202,807

**Update:** I’m the guy that made the Lego DNA project and posted about it here around 5 months ago.

TLDR of Original Post: Lego DNA project was running out of time, and needed support to remain alive. I posted here, and you guys helped me a lot :)

Sorry it took so long to post this update. Some things happened and I got very busy.

&#x200B;

I wanted to make this update to thank you for the awesome support you showed me that day, and for spreading the word and supporting it via the link ([https://ideas.lego.com/projects/5bd5311e-5078-4a7b-8763-e9cfd8a38c42](https://ideas.lego.com/projects/5bd5311e-5078-4a7b-8763-e9cfd8a38c42)) . Because of your help, we passed 5K before the time limit ended and the project is still alive! Thank you so so much! Now, we’re at 8.2K and we have some more time to get the last remaining 1800 supporters to get to 10K, when the project will be considered as a real Lego set!

I am very grateful to each and every single one of you. You guys gave me a huge amount of hope; in literally the last hours of the project, you helped it gain so much support. Thank you for saving 2 years’ worth of effort!

&#x200B;

As for the update: Because of you guys, there’s only 1800 supporters left for Lego DNA to reach the final goal. I would be grateful if you could help support the project and share it so we finally complete something that has been a dream of mine for a long time. This is the Lego DNA link, where there are pics as well: [https://ideas.lego.com/projects/5bd5311e-5078-4a7b-8763-e9cfd8a38c42](https://ideas.lego.com/projects/5bd5311e-5078-4a7b-8763-e9cfd8a38c42)

I know its illegal, but anything is better than homelessness.

Here's the problem, this 15 year old kid is on to me. Currently trying to make it seem like im just a racoon or some animal (although the kid would have to be very gullible, we dont have racoons in the southwest lol).

Any advice? Have any of you been in a similar situation? How can I not get cought?

518,cucxzx,2019-08-23,teenagers,I've become a god at my school.,"School has barely started and I'm already hailed as a god.

A little context. I'm not too popular. I'm always that one nerd kid, and the only time people would hear about me is if I won a math competition.

Well this year I changed that.

My school has posters up saying ""We encourage you to use your phones, tablets, and laptops."" The last one is what caught my eye. Because my school allows us to use our devices during lunch.

So I brought my laptop to school. For my first couple classes I would jokingly ask if I could use my laptop. But when lunch came around. Then things got good. I sat down at my normal lunch table and pulled out my laptop. Immediately people started eyeing me. Next I booted up my laptop. Now people were watching. Finally I got onto Minecraft and played some Hypixel Bedwars. I slowly gathered a crowd, and eventually people started chearing when I was winning.

When I won everyone went ballistic.

And that's how I became a god.

Edit: I don't have a way I can display proof. It may be on a Snapchat story or something, but I have no idea. I guess I was just at the right place at the right time. I did it kind of as a joke for my friends, but a lot more people noticed. My highschool separates the freshmen from everyone else. So it probably isn't as big of a crowd as some of you think, maybe 300 kids were at that lunch out of 1800. I can see how this can be thought of as karma farming now.

I'm sorry for ruining the general good vibes of this subreddit by hilgihting something so terrible but this really concerns all teenagers, and this is the only subreddit I know that will upvote anything. I apologize to the mods if this is not the most appropiate, but I really belive this desrves to be heard, and almost all other subreddits seem to remove this post.


I don't know where to start, this is horrifying situation. The vast majority of the 150 million people of my country has had their internet access cut off just recently. Internet speeds in Bangladesh are now [1.28KBPS](https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2018/08/04/authorities-slow-mobile-internet-to-quell-student-protests). That dot is not a typo. 1.28kbps is the actual speed.

I will make this as short as I can,

* It started when a 2 teenagers were killed by Bus who disobeyed traffic laws.
* Soon tens of thousands of  teenage and student protestors came out on the street enforcing traffic laws by thesmelves ensuring no one else has to die, all this incredibly peacefully.
* The government sent out, what I can only describe as their version of ""Hitler Youth""
* Rape, Murder, Assault by the Hitler Youth have been carried out. [very NSFL pictures here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/94ivyd/school_students_have_been_protesting_in_demand/e3ldg3t/)
*Any posts on Facebook, Youtube, that make light of these crimes against humanity seems to dissapear instantly.


[Bangladesh's Most Popular Yotuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFhws2AfBEk) (think of PewDiePie but Bangladeshi) has tried REAPEATDLY to upload videos on youtube informing people about where protests will take place, each time the videos get taken down. He attempted live streaming the video in 3 places at once, still got taken down.[Right now he's urging people NOT to protest anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUPMXCy63Cw) due the sheer violence and regard for their safety.

My freinds in Bangladesh are having their facebook posts removed, some are even being blocked and banned. HOW CAN FACBEOOK bend to GOVERNMENTS like this?

I don't know if the people in my country have access to internet or not right now. Websites reporting on this from Bangladesh are so slow right now I can't acess them. Someone please try accessing https://www.dhakatribune.com/ I can't.

I am in Singapore right now so I am able to access the internet just fine but I can't seem to contact any of my friends and families back home. It seems the government has cut off internet access to deter protest of an entire country. This is horrifying, this can not be acceptable in the modern world. They are doing this so that international media can not get a hold of the horror coming out of Bangladesh.

#Please, let the world know, because right now nothing is coming out of Bangladesh. We are silently being killed.


Our voices are being actively silenced. We need your help, whoever is reading, just know that this is going on, please let the world know about this , that young children are being mercilessly killed

All we wanted as teenagers was for people to obey some fucking traffic laws, and this is what happens.

To preface: I get that I'm somewhat at fault here, but the reason I'm pissed as hell is because it was a permanent ban.

So I got on one night to ask anybody if they had their spanish textbook since somebody ripped a page out of mine. No such luck, but I decided to wait a bit.

Someone made a comment about their time zone, and then I asked them if they were from \[insert state\]. They said yes, and then we realized we lived pretty close to each other. A mod was active, and he says, ""No meetups!"" to which the other guy says okay.

So clearly we weren't trying to meetup or anything, and then I think he makes some joke about finding me and eating me (which was very clearly a joke as he's been talking about eating for a while). And then both of us get permanently banned from the server. WHAT! WHAT THE WHAT (I'm sorry god) THE FRICKING FRICK!

Sure, we gave away some personal information by sharing what city we live in, but I don't think anyone's wellbeing was at risk! And we also SAID we weren't trying to meet up.

Anyways, I'm not trying to turn this into AITA, cuz I could go on and on about this shit, I just think it's messed up that the mod didn't give us a SINGLE warning about getting banned, he just banned us. And even if it was a 6 month ban, I would have been pissed but at least I get to come back! I did a lot of fun stuff on that server, and it even helped me with other stuff like debate, but that's all over now. Oh, and I never got that spanish page. So if any of you guys can recommend any similar fun discord servers that would be nice

I hate mods

tl;dr: I got permanently banned for ""organizing a meetup"" even though we said we weren't, and the mod didn't give us any warning.

Edit: Thanks guys for bringing this to the mods’ attention. I’m out right now, but I’ll try modmailing when I come back home :)

1) You only need exams to get you to the next step. Done your GCSEs? Great, as soon as you get a place on an A Level course they stop mattering. Once you have some proper job experience under your belt that’ll be more helpful that a Religious Education exam you did at 16.
- Obviously university degrees are different, as are some professions like going into medicine or law. But for most of us, exam results aren’t the shackles they seem to be. 

2) If you’re too drunk, water and carbohydrates can help your body to break it down better. If you’re too stoned, lemon brings you back a bit. If you’re having a bad trip, benzos can stop it completely depending on what you’ve taken. 
Be careful out there.

3) Never leave a friend behind when they wander off while wasted. Take care of them like the stupid toddlers they are.

4) Keep a 20 in your phone case for emergencies.

5) If someone much older than you is interested in you, remember there’s probably a reason that stops them from having any luck with people their own age. Chances are, when you’re the age they are now, you’ll look at people the age you were and think “WTF that’s practically a fetus wandering about”. Not worth it. 

6) If shit gets real bad, thinking “Will this matter in a week? A month? 6 months?” has helped me so much. 

7) Brush your goddamn teeth. You’re probably already on your second and final set, so take care of them.

I technically ""kissed"" a girl in the 3rd grade, but it was for 2 seconds and I dont even really remember what happened, so I dont count it. Ive had girlfriends since then, just was too much of a wuss to kiss most of them (one of my exs I tried to kiss once but was denied)
      The other night however, I went out with a girl for the night, and it went just as I always hoped it would.
We'd been hanging out, just driving around listening to music, and chatting for most of the night.
 There was an obvious attraction between us (the first time a girl has ever complemented my looks in terms of attraction)
We got back to her house, and I walked her to her door. We chatted for another minute or so, and she began to play with her hair, and bite her lip. I stepped closer, wrapping my arms around her waist as I pull her in for a long, sweet kiss.


Listen bois, if I can find a girl that finds me attractive enough to actually kiss me (I'm 5'9 and half, 310lbs),
So can you. I believe in you guys. Go get em tiger

Edit: Thank you all so much for blowing this up! 
Also, I really appreciate yalls worry about my size / weight, and I know that Im pretty big, but its not like Im some super unhealthy fat kid. Ive been at the same weight for over 2 years, and I eat a decently healthy diet. My doctor has said for the last year, that despite being on the heavy side, Im in good health. Im not diabetic, nor pre-diabetic. I played High school football for 3 years and kept in decent shape throughout that. Im not saying I dont plan on losing weight in the future, its just not my main priority right now. Again, I appreciate you're concern.",jaycetrt,t2_2gemd4b4,0.87,26531,869

542,bcnkgl,2019-04-13,teenagers,How I lost my virginity to a trap,"Let me tell you the story of how I lost my virginity to a trap.

It was 3 years ago, I was only 13. Indeed, young and innocent. Reading these first lines, I should quickly warn you that this story doesn't end good, but I need to talk about it, it's been too long since I did talk about it to someone.

So yeah, I was 13, in 7th grade. In my class, a cute girl was sitting in front of the class and I just couldn't help but look at her all the time and thinking about her. She was truely the girl of my dreams, with all the characteristics I needed. I wanted to talk to her, I knew I would only find a good person inside that wonderful body.

So that's what I did. On a 15-minute break, I found her in the hallway, all alone, listening to music. I went to see her. I asked her what kind of music she liked, only to find out she listens to the same type of music as I do. Wonderful.

It all started with the lines ""Hey, what are you listening to?""

I'm glad I started that conversation, as it lasted for the whole break before we went on to the other class. Because it was the first week of school, I made sure to sit right next to her this time, so we could talk. We truly had fun.

Now let's fast foward to a few months later. We're in December. It's near chirstmas, the whole school is decorated with christmas stuff, it's snowing outside and it's the last day of school before the two-week christmas break. All christmas, and living the dream as I'm walking down the hallway with my girlfriend.

That's right, my girlfriend. After a while, I confessed my love to her only to find out it was reciprocal.

We loved each other so much. It was magical.

Anyway, after a while in the ""christmas special period"" of the day, she asked me these exact words :

""Hey, would you like to come to my place after school? My parents are at some special office party so I would be alone""

I gladly agreed. 2 hours later, we found ourselves there.

She lives in a small, cute, cozy house. Right as we arrived we played a little bit on the PS2, then she went in her bedroom while I was waiting for her downstairs.

Then, all of a sudden, she asked all the way upstairs if I would mind coming, since she needed help for something. I was intrigued and accepted.

When I entered, I was shocked to see her wearing nothing but a bra and panties. I didn't have the time to say a word that she kissed me. I already kissed her before, but this time it was even more special,as she progressively took off all my clothes.

After a time, it was her turn to become completely naked. And so she removed her bra, to show her wonderful boobs and then... I noticed something.

A buldge. In her panties.

She removed them.

Before I could even look at what was there, she asked me something.

""Honey.... I need something.""

""What do you need?""

""I need about tree fiddy.""

It was about this time I realized that the girl was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

That goddamned Loch Ness Monster had tricked me again.

Anyways, i was dojng my schoolwork, and my parents werent home. I heard a car pull up, car door opens, car door closes. This all happens around 10:00 A.M, so still only 3rd period.

At first im like “oh its probably my mom, she probably just got back from shopping.” But my phone didnt get the life 360 notification, so i checked the app and it says she was at the store still, updated 2 mins ago.

Huh. Probably my dad, maybe he forgot something at work. No big deal. I didnt get that Life 360 notification, he was still at work. Now im a little worried, because i look out the window and ive never seen this car. 

A group of 4 gets out of the car, wearing bright red clothing. They all rush out and run to my front door. Shit. Is the door locked? Do i know these people? Do they have the key? So many questions were going through my head. I didnt risk going downstairs, i just locked my bedroom door.

I hear my front door close. They were inside. I hear them rushing up my creaky steps. I hide right beside my door, incase they got in. At the moment i am TERRIFIED. Were these my friends playing a prank on me? What was going on?

Suddenly out of nowhere. MY DOOR BUSTS DOWN. THEY BROKE DOWN MY DOOR.

You wanna know who was there? I literally never expected it at ALL.

545,aac0qw,2018-12-28,teenagers,"Soon, I will be turning 20. In my teenage years, I faced it all: drug addiction, heartbreak, depression, pregnancy, and more. Here's my advice to you.","Hi everyone. My name is Maya and I'm about to turn 20 years old. It feels weird to be posting here for probably the last time -- you may not recognize me but I joined this subreddit when I was 14. In the intervening 6 years, I've dropped out of school twice, gotten my heart broken countless times, spent time in a psychiatric facility after a suicide attempt, moved across the country 4 times, and dealt with drug addiction and teen pregnancy. I know that sounds like a lot, but right now I am 1.5 years clean, I live with my boyfriend of 1 year and our cat, I have a full-time job, a good circle of friends, and I couldn't be happier. If anyone can show you that no matter what shit goes down, you can turn it around, it's me. So here's my advice:

*  **Stop giving a fuck about what you look like.**  This has been my biggest personal change since high school. I used to spend HOURS in front of the mirror, worrying about a pimple the size of a pinhead. No one else is noticing that shit, I promise.
* **Reach out to your friends with mental illness.** Even if they never want to hang out, keep inviting them, They always say ""if you're struggling, reach out!"", but it should be the other way around as well. Check on your friends. 
*  **Condoms alone are not effective birth control.**
* **Ask for what you want.** Whether it's a promotion at your job or a date with the girl you like, you have to start asking for things. Point A is where you are now. Point B is where you want to be. The worst thing that happens if what you ask for gets turned down is you stay at Point A. 
* **Be kind to your teachers.**
* **Know the signs of an abusive relationship.** [https://au.reachout.com/articles/signs-of-an-abusive-relationship](https://au.reachout.com/articles/signs-of-an-abusive-relationship)
* **There is no age where you are required to have your life plan figured out.**
* **Always wear a helmet and close-toed shoes when riding a moped/motorcycle.**
* **Do not fucking ever do heroin.** Even if you think you won't get addicted. Even if your friends are supervising you. Even if you snort it. Do not do it.
* **If the only reason you won't do something is that you're afraid, do it.** Except for heroin lol. 
* **You will grow apart from your friends.** This is ok and nobody's fault.
*  **Don't worry too much about comparing your life to other people's.** And don't let it make you bitter. Congratulate them on their successes, and don't worry about how your accomplishments stack up next to theirs. 

and lastly,

* **Let yourself be young.** Put the right amount of pressure on yourself to succeed, but don't lose out on the years of your life where you have little to no responsibility and loads of free time! This is a time you will never get back, so make sure you're spending it doing stuff you enjoy. How you spend your days is how you spend your life. ",mayalcaulfield,t2_joxzt,0.84,25205,1032

we need to stop shaming kids for enjoying fortnite. minecraft is not superior. fortnite is not superior. they are both insanely popular and successful video games, targeted towards DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS. remember what it was like to get made fun of for playing minecraft? don’t make the younger generation hate us. let’s break the meta, and stop ostracizing kids for playing fortnite.

Edit 2: Lol to answer the 3 most common comments...

1. What game was it?
- Oh never heard of that one! It was the second level on Unraveled. Not the main story, the challenges to get new customization. It’s stupid hard. Basically had to guess when to go because it would randomly decide if you were to close or not. Good game, but I’m also trash at video games so that didn’t help. Finished it though! I went into the bathroom and sat on the floor and finished it my third try! Third level was easier.

Surprisingly really good game from EA. Really cute and unique idea. On sale for $5, highly recommended!

2. That was still rude, be more grateful of your mom.

-My mom is one of my best friends! We even have the same job and work together. She had only moved once and After I asked, she didn't move anymore. Thought she fell asleep. I don't think it's unreasonable to assume ""no meant no"" I finished the game on the bathroom floor afterwards lol.

3. PLEASE DONT STEREOTYPE WOMEN! First of all, I'm a girl, and do not do this, so obviously it's not all of us. Everyone comes from different walks of life, backgrounds and have their own interests and personalities. Putting everyone in one little box is a horrible thing to do. :(

It makes me sick how female pedophiles prey on underaged boys and Boomer and Millennial men think that it’s cool or something because sometimes the women that rape them are decent looking, statutory rape isn’t “cool”, but would you say a handsome 30 YO man fucking a 15 YO girl is “cool”? No, because it’s not cool. A sad teacher raping a child is never cool, I don’t care how attractive they are and a man getting RAPED is never good. 

On top of that, it’s always creeped me out how oddly intimidated older men are of a young man’s presence. I understand it’s nature, in our society mens worth is built on how strong and attractive they are and as you get older that fades. Older men with pot bellies and thinning hair would naturally feel intimidated by a younger more attractive man, but like DAMN men have no place treating teenage boys like they’re soldiers. Men really think that young men owe them respect just because they’re “wiser” (which most of the time they’re not) and more mature when in reality men are just clinging onto them at reasoning because they know if a young man doesn’t fear they could probably fuck them up. 

Adult men’s deep-seeded jealously towards male youth is sickening. A male friend of mine who is 16 and is very tall and muscular because he does boxing and adult men HATE him on sight when he doesn’t even do anything, and the reason why is because they are intimidated by him and are too on their high horse to admit it.

all this really got me thinking about a time not too long ago when I was contemplating suicide. it’s really strange seeing the reaction of everybody here, and how so many people were affected by their death - both by the sadness from the loss of a friend, or the guilt of thinking they could have done more. it makes me appreciate being alive right now.

if you’re depressed, or contemplating suicide, just know that there are people out there who care for you. who will miss you. you might not see it day to day, but there will always be somebody who will be saddened by your loss. if you can’t think of anyone, you need not look far.

576,hceb0p,2020-06-20,teenagers,"I Turn 20 Tomorrow, And I'd Like To Leave A Few Nuggets Of Job Advice For The Younglings","I've lurked on this sub for a long time, never posting but commenting once in a while. And from what I've seen, there's some pretty wild perspectives on life here. I come from a pretty wild place in life myself, and I've learned some very different things in the short time I've been a lawful adult. So here you go.

1. To the teens starting to work or those who haven't had a job before, there's a difference between getting ragged on by people, and getting genuinely helpful advice. If a senior at your place of employment is constantly giving you corrections and telling you to do something specific, for the sake of routine, it's not because they think you're bad at your job. It's because they want you to succeed in your job and your life. If people stop giving you advice and making corrections on your work, it's most likely because you didn't listen or improve and they have written you off. It's harsh, but that's just how it is sometimes.

2. Do NOT underestimate the power of being early or on time. Showing up to work ten minutes early is an extremely healthy example of good time management. Your employer already expects this of you, so seeing someone dedicated to this very important aspect of life is a good spot on your track record with them.

3. No matter how easy it comes or how much you want to, do not ever spread gossip or rumors. If someone is blurting out private information of other people to you, you are well within your right to straight up ignore them. The older lady who won't stop bitching about the manager she doesn't like? Ignore her. It's very easy for rumors and gossip to go back on you.
3(b). Bonus tip: The sooner you accept that no matter what you do or what you say, people will gossip about you your entire life. Most of the time it's harmless banter, but for real, the more you attach value or attention to what people say about you, the more it's going to eat at your mental health.

4. Hygiene and cleanliness go a long way. Make it a priority at home to take extra care to properly clean yourself and take care of your teeth. If you think people won't notice if you miss a shower, I can 100% guarantee that they will. Your teeth aren't necessarily a key factor in your appearance as I don't think people care that much, but if you have to think about whether your breath smells? It does.

5. I know that the opinion and view on this is very different with everyone and varies depending on the person, but you gotta toughen up a little emotionally if you're going to join the work force. If somebody makes one comment or twenty on your work or personality or appearance, nothing is more important than maintaining your composure and letting it go. Life is hard and sometimes you gotta chew a few nails. If someone is blatantly trying to aggravate you and elicit an angry or negative reaction from you? Do not hesitate to file a complaint. A lot of companies have some form of anonymous complaint hotlines, ask a co-worker you trust how to access these resources if available.

6. People teasing you doesn't always mean they don't like you or want to hurt your feelings. There's a pretty good chance that if someone suddenly stops making fun or teasing you, that's when they stop liking you. Don't take stuff too hard if you don't know what they're intentions. Better yet, ask them. If they're not upset or annoyed by you, they will give you a serious and honest answer.

7. Don't pry into personal details regardless of how good your working relationship seems to be. It is extremely unprofessional to prod for juicy personal stuff because it's pretty much guaranteed that it will somehow get out and may put their employment on the line (just a more extreme example).

8. Once you're clocked in, it is obligation and dedication until you're off the clock. You're there to earn money and make a living, but so are the people who hired you and those who are working alongside you. Respect everyone's time as you would wish yours to be, because the only obligation to you is that which follows you doing your job: a paycheck.

9. I'm sure that many of you are sick of hearing this, I was too at one point, but sometimes you gotta suck it up and stick it out. If you quit one job, there's no guarantee that the next one makes you look back on the previous one as ""not that bad"" all of a sudden.


Thank you for reading everyone, my father (63) and I (19, for now) made this list together specifically for this sub. We both hope that you all stay safe and take care of yourselves, and we also pray that life provides you with many opportunities to learn and grow with dignity and shared respect.

Edit: Wow, this is the most that any of my posts have blown up. Thanks everyone for your kind words. To those who are still lost on a few other things, I would highly recommend going into the comments and checking out some of the other really awesome bits of advice that folks like me have been offering down below. I'm sorry that I couldn't answer some of your guys' questions lol I posted this right before I went to sleep. I feel so overcome with happiness knowing so many of you are open to learning and receiving advice that many others might find bland, repetitive, or downright toxic. All of this advice came from a place of genuine care and is built on personal experiences in the workplace. Thank you everyone, again. I'm now 20, and I gotta go to work in an hour and a half, so I'll try to maybe answer some comments later tonight once I'm home.

578,ijc4b4,2020-08-30,teenagers,I’m still in the slammer for a long time but here’s an update,"This is surreal. The [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ij0q8m/goodbye_boys_its_been_a_long_one_no_im_not/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) post blew up. 

As a result two of my friends found it. The first messaged me and asked if I wanted him to manage the Reddit account. We thought about it but decided that realistically, what is there to manage? I have the password and email so I can keep it safe until I return. 

Thank you to everyone that gave me the advice (except for the people that told me to commit manslaughter). A lot of people were saying how my parents are morons and toxic. In reality they’re just har d set on their own beliefs about screens and behavior (which is funny considering they both work programming jobs). I’ll take this time to work on my relationship with them and these beliefs. 

A lot of people were worried about my gaming accounts but I have found a friend to watch over them. It seems that I may finish the CoD battle pass after all. The stuff I got from the games was free from packs or finishing free battle passes. 

I still do have my computer for school though and my dad is thinking of getting me an actual pc because “the computers the school gives out are piles of trash and should be ashamed to be called computers.” His words, not mine. Little do they know that the school computer restricts access to certain websites and if they get me my own I can watch probably any tv show or movie I want by... let’s just say becoming a really bad egg.

My parents have explained that they at least believe that my mental health is deteriorating from screens but they want to hear me out. They just want me to follow what they’ve put in place for a while.

Lastly, a lot of people put !Remindeme comments on the original post so when I do return, I’ll do an edit on these posts, and post something on my profile.

I’ll answer comments as long as I can. As far as my parents understand I’m doing something important so they let me have the phone for half the day today. 

But until then, goodbye homies and homettes.

580,fi0ke5,2020-03-13,teenagers,fuck all of you who pretend to care about mental health,"There's this kid in my school, Josh for the sake of simplicity, who clearly has something going on with him. I've seen him have meltdowns in class before, sobbing how he hates his life and wants to kill himself (this has happened maybe three times during classes I've had with him, and I know of two other times in my friends' classes) in the last three years. He stresses easily in class and he can be quite quick to anger at times.

Josh doesn't have many friends, I see him around with maybe one or two other guys every now and then (who also go through bullying mainly for associating with him, but they still stick by) and he's usually quite to himself. He's quiet, likes video games and comic, and that's about all I know about him. I don't interact with Josh much, other than the times I've invited him for group projects since no one else would, so I don't really know what he's like. But, from our limited interactions, he's nice enough when he's in a better mood and seems kinda chill.

This kid goes through so much bullying. Constantly being called a school shooter, retard, psychopath, etc. People go out of their way to ignore him, exclude him, insult him. It's gross. He doesn't deserve this. I can only imagine how this shit effects him. But these are the same people who once every few months post shit like ""mental health is important! if anyone's going through anything I'm always open to talk ♥️"" or whatever. 

These people don't care. 

If you're mental health problems aren't ""pretty"" and easily romanticised, you're a freak and a retard and are probably going to shoot up the school. If them talking to you doesn't make them look good, they couldn't give less of a fuck about you.

And you know what? Some of these shitty kids struggle with depression or anxiety or something else themselves. But that's not a valid excuse to treat others like shit.

583,ivb2y5,2020-09-18,teenagers,"Hello, r/Teenagers. Teacher here. I wanted to give you an honest accounting of which annoying parts of remote learning (turning on mics, cameras, dress code, etc.) are real and which ones are bullshit.","I've seen a lot of memes and posts complaining about the different things teachers make you do during online classes. I thought it might be helpful to tell you which ones you're completely right about (shh, don't tell them I told you) and which ones are actually important.

1. \*\*Dress codes, inappropriate attire, etc.\*\*This one is total bullshit. It doesn't matter what you wear, as long as you're wearing something. Seriously, who cares? Schools or teachers that enforce dress codes during remote learning are making a bad situation worse. You should be comfortable.

&#x200B;

2) \*\*Location. eg. laying in bed during class\*\*I don't know why anyone cares about this one either. Whether you're in bed, on your couch, at the kitchen table...who cares? It's annoying that some schools have rules about this sort of thing. Again, you should be comfortable.

&#x200B;

3) \*\*Please turn on your cameras\*\*Ok, here's where I stop pretending to be cool and make enemies. It's super important that you turn on your camera, even if it makes you more comfortable not to. You have no idea how much teachers feed off of and respond to body language. This is the main way a decent teacher can tell if you're interested, if you're confused, or even if you're bored or tired. Teaching to empty black windows feels terrible; it's like standing in front of a classroom of empty desks. There's no feedback at all, so we just flail around. Imagine doing stand-up comedy to an empty theater and you'll understand how humiliating it feels. All that I ask for is having your full head visible, so I can see your facial expression, and so that you can nod 'yes' or 'no'.

&#x200B;

4) \*\*Eyes forward\*\*This one is stupid. You don't have to be staring into the camera to be able to hear and understand. You're not always looking right at the teacher during a real class, so unless you're clearly doing something you shouldn't be, I don't really care where you're looking.

&#x200B;

5) \*\*Please turn on your mics\*\*This is the front-line in the war between teachers and students during remote learning. I understand how tempting and powerful the notion of being able to mute yourself is--a power you never had in the Before Times. However, here's what it looks like from a teacher's perspective: I ask a question to a screen full of people leaning back in their chairs/beds with their mics off. I absolutely \*know\* that nobody is going to answer it. Getting up the nerve to answer a question in class or participate in a discussion is hard enough, having to sit up, lean forward, and click a button makes it almost impossible.

A muted mic also means that nobody will \*ask\* any questions either. Asking questions is incredibly important for learning, as the smart kids are well aware. It's also important for the teachers. We screw up all the time and we rely on students to ask questions about things we forgot to mention. We even need you to correct us when we're wrong (Personally, I can't write on a board and talk at the same time, so I often end up filling the board with really weird errors).

A caveat to this is that, if you have a noisy house or a malfunctioning microphone, it's definitely better to keep it muted. You should also be free to mute when you're doing work or when it's not an active discussion or lesson.

6) \*\*Changing your background\*\*This one is fine. I don't think it's as hilarious as you do, though. So I just ignore it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

7) \*\*Petting your dog/cat\*\*Ugh, fine, I guess. As long as you're still able to write/type.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

8)\*\*Food, drink, props, etc.\*\*Again, who cares if students eat? In fact, since there's no risk of you making a mess in the classroom, it should be even more acceptable during remote learning. It's ridiculous that a kid got expelled for playing with a toy gun during online school. You're stuck at home without normal classroom interaction; anything that makes it easier for you without disrupting others is fine by me.

&#x200B;

9)\*\*Parents\*\*This one is a dealbreaker. Your parents should absolutely stay the f\*ck out of it. They shouldn't be sitting next to you during class, or walking in to check on things, or--holy shit--asking or answering questions. Can you imagine how insane it would be if your parent walked into the classroom and acted that way?? (In case you didn't already know, teachers generally hate parents. A dumb or annoying student is nothing compared to a dumb or annoying parent).

Final thoughts:I will be the first to admit it: remote learning is completely terrible. It's terrible for you; it's terrible for us. We're not able to teach effectively, and you're not able to learn effectively. You're isolated from social interaction and presented with tons of easily-available distractions. Nobody wins in this scenario.

I hope this post was somewhat enlightening. Feel free to call me out on anything you don't agree with. If there's something annoying I forgot to put on the list, ask, and I'll do my best to tell you the truth about it.  
\---------------------------

EDIT: Thanks for all of the awards and interest. I'm glad so many people found this helpful. For what it's worth, I also found it extremely helpful. I really enjoyed hearing your stories about your experiences, especially those about school systems or teachers with insane requirements. It should also go without saying that my experiences are not the same as everyone's experiences, and that we have a hugely diverse range of schools, classes, and students in the comments.

A lot of people have commented or messaged me asking questions, which I'll try to answer here briefly.  


\-I teach high school juniors and seniors. My classes are not typical HS classes, but I teach way more total students per semester than a normal teacher, but for less time. My class includes grammar, math, writing, science, and other stuff. I understand that things are different for elementary-aged students in remote learning--honestly, online elementary-school is a terrifying hellscape that makes teaching teenagers seem like a dream vacation.

  
\-If there's loud background noise or feedback, I definitely ask students to mute their mics. In my experience, this is pretty rare, but I guess it's very common for others.   


\-Based on discussion in the comments, we may have discovered that there's a particular type of anxiety that comes with being on camera, especially when one's own camera feed is visible, that doesn't compare with being looked at in real life. We should probably tell psychologists about this if we can't go back to in-person school.  


\-I may have been hyperbolic when I said that teachers hate parents. But parents can be unbelievably annoying. Like really, really annoying. Actually, for a lot of teachers, what I said is true.  


\-For those of you asking if I can be your teacher--actually, I could be, sort of, since I'm doing online tutoring these days. However, there are so many trolls among you that I'd have to be an idiot to give you contact info  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ ",Lord_Bronte,t2_x0s0z,0.96,20437,750
584,nj7qgs,2021-05-23,teenagers,"So our principal decided to cancel some of our final exams, and what my SS teacher posted on Google Classroom after that almost made me cry",""" You probably have heard by now that there will be no social studies final exams.  I want you to know two things: 1) I have given all of you 40 out of 40 points for the studying you have done for your social studies exam already.  You worked hard this year, I think we covered very meaningful info and thinking this past week, and I appreciate your efforts.  2) I have loved learning with each of you all this year! Through the hard times, and the more light-hearted.  I consider this to be the job of my lifetime.  May you go forth and shine, and know that I will always help you.  Always.""

Edit: No the teacher isn't a Nazi goddamit

Edit 2: For some of you who are complaining about ""gRaDe InFlAtIoN"", 2 things.

1. This class is intense, and the way that it is taught is very different from the way other schools teach social studies. Plus, people in this class are very hard-working, so this automatic full mark probably ""saved"" nobody's grade. And most of the class probably would've gotten close to that grade anyways. And we have been studying for this exam as a class together for a few weeks in class now, so we all know we have been studying well. That is in addition to the studying we do at home. So no, there's nothing about this that inflates our grade.
2. (This is copied from a reply I made to somebody who said the teacher is a 1/10)  This teacher teaches all of high school and middle school. Around 100 kids, which isn't a lot, but when you think about the fact that she needs to teach around 10 different classes with different curriculums across 7 different grade levels then yeah it becomes a lot. And she pours her heart and soul into every class. She has never once assigned a worksheet from online, but always makes her own assignments and spends ages discussing them with us. And she grades every single one in due time and gives us constructive feedback on each assignment. For 100 students, in 10 classes, across 7 different grade levels. So yes, she's a 10/10 teacher, and her being kind and considerate by automatically giving us a full mark on our 10% final does not make her a 1/10.

It started with small things like pens, couple dollars and then a couple days ago, a condom i had lying in my drawer. Apparently, my brother took this condom i had and beat off into it while my family and i where out of the house. When we came back we heard him scrambling and quickly running into his room. Later that day my mom was shouting at my dad very loudly and calling him unfaithful. My mom found a used condom stuffed in between the couch cushions. My mom basically thinks my dad is having an affair. I was super confused and then my brother fessed up to me, but he doesn't have the courage to tell my mom. I felt like stopping this situation right in its tracks but for some reason my father is not denying the claims. So i think my brother just lit the match on my parents marriage. I am starting to believe my dad really might have had a broad over because this is not passed his character. I told my brother if guilt eats at him he can fess up, but im out of the house in a couple months anyways, and i know my mom had suspicion of my dad previously. My dad is probably like ""fuck, i knew i got rid of that thing""...

Edit- if people are wondering why i wasn't the one questioned about the condom its because I've been settling into an apartment. i just turned 18 in March.

My problem was, i cut class because it was fun. The rebellion was what I was after. 

If i had known how deeply it would have hurt me to lose my education, I wouldn't have done it. I thought, I'm smart! I'll make it anyway.

Then I graduated, with no hopes of college. I got the highest paying jobs i could find, which meant working way harder than everyone else and still making less money. 

My friends have high rise apartments, great paying jobs, and don't have to worry much about their lives. 

I am going back to school at 25, to maybe catch up. 

Don't skip school. Please.

I'm reading every comment, and I want to make one thing very clear...

I do not advocate for teenage cannabis usage. Please don't smoke it up heavy. Most adults don't do that, it will not make you look or be more grown.

That being said, i would much rather see people smoking weed than drinking. So if you must numb yourself, please don't turn to a bottle, either.

Not like ""dont do drugs"" ever meant shit to the kids that actually were being affected by it, so really all I got here is, learn moderation as soon as you can. Much love.

When I smoke and lay in bed my creativity blasts and I become a professional engineer. I thought I could take a break from the regular old beating of meat and try something else. I took a glove, wrapped a towel around it, pulled the hole of the hole over the towel, and taped it together, and lubed that thing up. Boom bootleg pocket pussy. The thing felt like what I imagine it’d feel like to fuck Tiffany from Chucky. I was again smacked to all hell and it did it’s job. I went to clean up and heard my mom open my door. She’s an innocent old Indian woman with no understanding of sex as far as I know or at least hope to god is true. She sees the thing and asks me what it is and starts inspecting it. I took it from her before my wasted children could fall out and told her it was a knife cleaner. 
   She becomes so proud of me and acts like I’m Albert Einstein if he took steroids instead of aderall. I disposed of the glove (easy cleaning. Like I said, fucking engineer.) and went on with my day like nothing happened. Fast forward 3 days and she calls me down and asks me to show her how to use the knife cleaner. So I assembled a pocket pussy in front of my poor mother and my older brother looks in horror. I pretend that I have no idea what he’s freaking out about. I lubed that thing up with dish soap, stuck a knife in that thing, and started to jack it slowly to not cut myself and scrub the curry off of it. 
   She looks in awe and asks me to make her one to keep inside the cabinet and to buy more gloves when I’m coming home from the gym. Why does my teenage years have to do shit like this to me all the time. 
 

TLDR: mom found my homemade pocket pussy and thinks it’s to clean knifes with. Wants me to make her one and show her how to make one and wants to use it all the time.

616,f1evl4,2020-02-09,teenagers,Peeing with a boner is more difficult that giving birth.,"Peeing with a boner is more difficult than giving birth.

I am being 100 percent serious when I say this. This shouldn't even be an unpopular opinion, people just don't think about what the word ""difficult"" actually means.

Peeing with a boner is more difficult than giving birth. Giving birth is definitely more painful, but pain by itself does not make something difficult. For example, putting my hand in a fire is not difficult, but it would hurt a lot. In order for something to be difficult, there has to be some chance of failure due to lack of skill, practice, or technique. Peeing with a boner often requires creative problem solving skills, especially in small spaces. There is no creative problem solving aspect of giving birth. Additionally, the way humans have evolved for these two actions supports my point. Giving birth is a natural process, which humans have evolved to be able to do. The female body is literally designed so that it can give birth with the lowest possible chance of error. The only real error that can happen is a miscarriage, which is also a natural occurrence, not a failure that occurs due to a lack of skill in giving birth. The male body, on the other hand, has evolved specifically so that peeing with a boner is very difficult. The only purpose for having a boner is to impregnate a woman, so the male body evolved to prevent urination during sex. On top of the difficulty in simply getting the pee to flow, there's the issue of actually positioning yourself so that the boner is pointing into the toilet bowl (urinals are much easier, but not always an option). In the past, I have had to give up and wait until my boner goes away because it was simply too difficult to actually pee in the toilet. There has never been a case where a woman has tried to give birth after being pregnant for nine months, not been able to do it, and said ""fuck it"" and waited 3 more months to try again because it would be easier the second try. Giving birth happens, every single time, because it's a natural process - peeing with a boner is the opposite. 

In conclusion, peeing with a boner is hard.

Putting a few counter arguments in here:

1. Peeing with a boner doesn't kill babies, so of course we put more medical effort into giving birth. Also, I'm talking about the actual act of pushing the baby out, not doctors trying to save someone else's baby from dying due to a NATURALLY OCCURRING error, not a woman not having enough skill to successfully deliver the baby. Oh, and don't forget that giving birth has been around way longer than doctors. We don't need them, they just decrease the natural rate of failure that comes with creating an entire new human. As another user said in this comment section, we used to give birth in caves wearing loincloths.  

  

2. You obviously have very little understanding of how evolution works. Humans have not reached some perfect form where all of our bodily functions are flawless. And yes, it is 100 percent true that we have evolved to be able to give birth. If you don't think that's true, you know nothing about evolution and should probably just stop using it as an argument. Evolution makes us more likely to pass on our DNA, and giving birth is literally a process in which we pass on our DNA to a new human. Small random changes over time, as well as natural selection through probability have both made it more and more likely for babies to survive childbirth. But since the human body has many purposes besides giving birth, it cannot possibly be a perfect birth-giving machine. There at inevitable natural errors that happen, and that's just the way it is. Again, I'm also only talking about the act of actually pushing the baby out, not the doctors who help out. Standing in the shower to pee? Since when were there showers in gas station bathrooms?  
  
  



3. When I wait for the boner to go away, I'm avoiding peeing with a boner. Read that sentence again. **IT MEANS I'M NOT FUCKING PEEING WITH A BONER.** Peeing *with a boner* is the hard part, not just peeing. And just because giving birth requires effort does not mean it is difficult. It happens every time. I think you're ignoring the ways we've evolved mentally to be able to give birth. Yet another way in which you misunderstand what evolution is. It is natural instinct for a woman to do what is required to give birth. Everything she *needs* is there from the moment she hits puberty, in both the physical and mental categories, as well as the chemicals that are produced in the brain. As for the pain? Evolution isn't meant to make you happy, it's meant to make you survive. The point of pain is to make people safer. It's meant to make you think twice about doing something that might cause you to feel pain. Maybe if there was no pain I giving birth, humans in the past would've had way too many kids and would've been worse off because their instincts would be to protect all of them, which would be a burden.  

   


4. As I said above, the purpose of waiting until the boner goes away is so that you don't have to pee with a boner, because it's difficult. I guess I shouldn't have assumed that the people reading this post would be smart enough to figure that out.  


Finally, giving birth is...  


#INEVITABLE.  


Therefore it never doesn't happen due to a lack of skill from the birth-giver. Peeing with a boner does. The point I'm trying to make with this post is that peeing with a boner is like a 3 on the difficulty scale (varies based on dick size and bathroom size) and giving birth is inapplicable to the definition of ""difficult.""",effitidc,t2_4axd2wwh,0.76,18093,919

as much as i disagree on his viewpoint on BLM, he’s right. in pursuit of equality, society has put certain ethnicities and minorities, especially black people, on a pedestal. and naturally, being on the forefront of the public eye, we’re both constantly mocked, and overly praised. 

I don’t wanna be a *dangerous* black dude to somebody i never met. I don’t wanna be a *poor, mistreated black dude* to someone either. i just wanna be a dude. 

and i don’t really like the entire “i don’t see color”, you definently do, but the counter argument of “don’t ignore color that’s like ignoring culture” is equally unlikeable. they’re both well-intentioned, but my color isn’t a personality trait. see it, acknowledge it, move on.

620,bkt18y,2019-05-05,teenagers,my principal read my erotic fan fiction,"this happened a long time ago but i completely forgot about it until now.

ok so back when i was in the seventh grade i was obsessed with one direction and i used to write fan fiction about the members being together. 

my friends loved to read the stories because they were all horny thirteen year olds so i would write them during class (which is totally not why i almost failed math). my one friend at the time was obsessed with the walking dead, so she asked me if i’d write a dirty fanfic about one of the characters for her and i agreed. 

cut to the next day we were all outside for recess and the story was being passed around while everyone giggled and gasped.

my principal was walking around and talking to different students. he came over and asked us what was so funny and my friend told him that it was just a story i wrote. he asked if he could read it and i quickly said no. i guess this made him suspicious because he demanded we hand it over. 

and then i had to stand there as my principal read the dirty story i had wrote, dick sucking and fucking included, right in front of me. i was ready to cry, i swear to god i thought i was gonna be in huge trouble.

but no, he finished the story, and then he told me that it was inappropriate and i shouldn’t write something like that during school again. and then he walked away. he never did give the story back so my friends and i used to joke that he liked it so much he hung it on the wall in his office so he could always read it.

he left the school not too long after but it doesn’t end there. two yrs later i auditioned for creative writing at this arts high school, WHICH HE JUST SO HAPPENED TO BE THE PRINCIPAL AT, and when he saw me he asked what i was auditioning for. i told him and he smiled and was like “i’m sure you’ll get in, you were always a really good writer” and then i proceeded to melt into the ground because HE REMEMBERED.

624,ciwdm4,2019-07-28,teenagers,31 pieces of advice that I have learned during my time as a teenager (19 now).,"Being 19 I sometimes feel sooooo old on this sub. Being a teenager senior citizen, I just wanted to use my elderly experience to help out some of you youngsters before yelling at you to get off my lawn. 

&#x200B;

I am not an expert and a lot of this advice might not be shit, however this is what I have personally learned from my experience as a teenager. If you have any other additional advice please comment it and I might add it to the list.

&#x200B;

* **Go out and do stuff**. I currently work with kids ages 11-15 and I see so many being forced to go out and be social by their parents and hating it. I know it might push you out of your comfort zone, but go out there and have fun. Its hard at first but looking back on it now I wish I had done more. A lot of your loneliness and depression struggles will be solved just by doing this.
* **Don't feel like you HAVE to be in a relationship.** 2 of my 3 relationships ended horribly and the 3rd one (1st one chronologically) was so meaningless that we never technically broke up; we just kinda stopped talking to each other...Now that I think about it we technically are still dating so I should probably get her a 7 year anniversary present. The majority of my great memories happened when I was with my friends (boys and girls) rather than with a partner. I know it might feel like you have to get a girlfriend or boyfriend but unless you really like someone, its not always worth it.
* **That being said, if you do like someone just go for it.** Yeah, there's a good 50% chance that you'll get rejected but chances are no ones going to care about it later. Just go up to him/her and go for it. Obviously you'll need some build up by flirting, but don't be afraid.  One thing that I've noticed is that chances are if you are feeling things about someone, he/she is feeling the same way about you.
* **Sometimes the best way to get someone to like you is to simply tell them.** Ive had this happen both ways for me. Ive had girls that I've never thought about tell me that they like me thus resulting with me liking them and Ive also had it happen where I've subtly told girls that I like them which resulted with them liking me back. Its an odd phenomenon but it does happen. Maybe don't go in their face and go ""HEY GIRL I HAVE A HUGE CRUSH ON YOU"" but just tell them that they're cute or something small (just dont be creepy about it and work it into the conversation).
* **When you apply to college do not slack off.** I fucked up real bad and didn't prepare myself very well and did a lot of things last minute. This ended with me getting rejected from some serious schools that my grades were competitive in.
* **1 grade does matter.** This one daily goes out to those trying to get into difficult colleges. A lot of people will tell you that ""oh, just one D won't hurt you"", but let me tell you, it will. This usually only matters if it is in the subject are that you are planning on studying in though. I had a C+ during my first semester of precalculus, and despite getting an A during second semester and an A during both semesters Calculus a few schools that rejected told me that it was because of that one C+. I know a lot of you aren't going for super prestigious schools, but for the handful that are PLEEEEEEAAAASSEEE take your grades seriously.
* **Get a job that you love.** I HATED my parents when they forced me to get a job during my summer after my freshman year. I ended up getting a job at a grocery store as a bagger. I worked there for literally a grand total of 4 days before quitting. After that I got a job somewhere else (Not going to say exactly where because I don't want to be identified) and I ended up loving it. Literally had some of the best memories of my life there and I wouldn't trade it for the world. Yeah, I could have made more money working as a waiter but it didn't even feel like I was working where I worked.
* **Get social media!!** (instagram, facebook, snapchat...). I used to be like a lot of you guys. I hated social media and I didn't want anything to do with it. I never even set up an instagram or facebook account until my senior year. The reason why I say this is because even though Ive only just graduated, I am already quickly losing contact with a lot of friends. I wish I started my social media accounts sooner to make it less awkward to connect with them later on.
* **Adulthood hits you like a truck so enjoy being a child.** It's so weird because it legitimately just feels like one day your suddenly an adult and you no longer have the protections of a child. Everyone kinda has this ""oh shit"" moment when they realize it. For me it was when I was going to a friends school to bring them something. I forgot to check in with the office and the secretary chased me down yelling ""Sir, you need to check in at the office"". It was the first time that I was ever addressed as Sir and not as a child.
* **Drugs and alcohol are fun, but they are not worth it.** During spring break you do not want to be the kid who has to call their friends parents to tell them that he has passed away because he OD on drugs. It is horrible and it is impossible to get over. Just do not do it. Even the things that seem harmless aren't worth it because it never stops there.
* **Connect with your teachers.** They are resources that you can use both in school and years later. I had a teacher write me a letter of recommendation that literally almost made me cry it was so good. I haven't started my first year of college yet, but I also been told by friends the they constantly email their old teachers asking them for help. Your teachers are not just there for you during the school year, but they are there for you for your life. If you have a question just ask them.
* **Join a team.** It doesn't have to be a sports team. Joining a team will help build skills that will be useful for your entire life. I also made my best friends this way.
* **Just because other people are doing it doesn't make it right.** This is something that has fucked me sooooooo many times. I am a pretty innocent person which has led me to be taken advantage of many many times. If someone, even your best friend, tells you to do something think about the consequences prior to doing it. Im not going to go into details about this, but my life was almost ruined because someone peer pressured me into doing something.
* **Adults are (usually) not out to get you.** They (usually) just want what is best for you. During my junior year we had something happen at our school that a lot of people thought that the staff mishandled. We had students complaining about it for weeks afterwards and putting blame on the staff and criticizing them for not doing their job right. Sometimes this is hard to understand, especially as a teenager when you want to be an adult so badly, but 90% of the time those who are in charge of you just wants what is best for you. In the case that I am referring too, the situation was extremely bizarre and the staff didn't want to cause panic. They did what they did not because they wanted to withhold information from us but because they wanted to protect us.
* **Look at things from the other persons perspective.** This goes off of the last one. Before getting mad because someone did something that hurt you just try to understand the reasons as to why they did that. I know that this is hard sometimes, but it will help you as a person. As I have said before, 90% of the time people are not out to get you and its usually just a misunderstanding.
* **Start a resume early.** This is pretty self explanatory, but its easy to write about an event when it initially happens. Maybe dont even start a resume but just start portfolio that documents events in your life.
* **TAKE PICTURES.** I fucking HATED people taking pictures of me so much that there are almost no pictures of me from the last 4 years. In the future you are going to want to look back at events and have good memories. Even if it hurts you now, having pictures of events will bring you joy in the future.
* **Being cool is not worth missing out.** This is something that I have always struggled with. I always wanted to be the cool kid. Fuck whatever is popular and fuck adults amiright? Wrong. Do what you want to do (within legal bounds) without worrying about how it will affect your social status.
* **Take care of your body,** you'll appreciate it later. Specifically your back (proper lifting). Before eating that giant greasy hamburger think if its really worth it. If its what you've been craving all day then go ahead and eat it, but if you're okay with passing and taking a salad instead then don't go for it.
* **Play an instrument**. There is nothing more beautiful in this world than music. When I say play an instrument I dont mean play an instrument in concert band or orchestra, I mean actually play music the you love on your own time. It helps you express creativity and helps with your emotions. Even if its just strumming a few chords on the guitar it is still worth it.
* **Always have extra cash on you.** It rarely happens, but theres going to be one time where you are forced to use cash and you won't have it.
* **Tell people how much you appreciate them**. To this day this is something that I struggle with. I know that its sometimes hard or awkward, but one day you're going to lose someone out of nowhere and you will regret it if you never tell them how much you appreciate them.
* **Don't go out with someone just because you want to have sex with them.** I know a lot of you guys want to lose it ASAP, but its not worth it if its not with someone that you truly love.
* **Don't feel obligated to have sex with someone:** This goes off of the last one. If you aren't ready you aren't ready. It's your body. If you don't want to do it don't do it.
* **Do an all nighter at least once.** Im sure 90% of you have already done this but you reach a form of enlightenment at 4 am when you and your friends are high af (Hey, sometimes I don't listen to my own rules) and sleep deprived.
* **Do not text and drive.** I saw a car flip once because the person was texting while driving I, a 17 year old at the time, was the person that pulled the injured and bloody person out of the car. I have no idea how he didn't die. I also got hit once from behind by someone texting while driving and that was not fun so for the sake of everyone else, turn your phone off if you can't keep away from it.
* **Don't just like something because its popular**: Go be your own person. Whether its music, a video game, a sport, or whatever the hell your into, sometimes the most popular options aren't what is for you. Go and explore a little before settling on what is popular.
* **Choose your friends wisely:**  I know that it's hard to cut off a life long friend, but sometimes the person's toxicity is not worth it. I had to do it with someone that I was friends with since I was 5 a few years ago, and you know where he is now? prison. Sometimes it's just not worth sticking with someone.
* **Learn self control:** Sometimes you just feel  like you just want to punch a wall because you're so mad (ive done it and broken a bone because of it), or you just want to lose your mind and get lit af, or maybe you just want to go spend your life savings on a new guitar because it looks cool. Sometimes this stuff is okay, sometimes it's not. Just learn to control yourself before you ruin yourself. Ive done all of the above and regretted doing all of the above.
* **Do not hesitate to ask for help:** To this day I still struggle to ask for help and I know that I am hypocritical saying this. Use your resources to help you out. A lot of times it might feel like you're abandoned on an island but there are people out there for you. Whether it is a teacher for educational help, a counselor for emotional help, or a friend for social help there is always someone willing to help you out.
* **If you are feeling sick go to the doctor:** I know someone who had a cough for 9 months and refused to go to the doctor because it was just a nuisance and nothing major. Turns out she had cancer in her throat. I know it may feel stupid going to the doctor for some things, but it's better to be safe than sorry.

625,i26k1u,2020-08-02,teenagers,My mother laughed at my uncle's suicide,"So my uncle died a couple months ago, I was pretty upset, but I got over it. Earlier today I heard my mom trying to sell his van over the phone to her friend. Her friend asked how he died and she jokingly said ""he threw himself in front of a train"" and started laughing.

This is fucking disgusting. I cant believe I live with this woman. I had no idea it was a suicide so the fact that she has the audacity to joke about it is so fucked up.

Edit: My dad's yelling at me to go to bed I'll respond to your comments in the morning

Edit 2: wow holy fuck I did not expect that much support! Thank you so much guys, I appreciate every single one of you, and I cant back to all of your comments, but I see them all :)

Edit 3: the are some frequent questions/misconceptions than keep arising. I'm going to answer these when I get the chance in another update.

Edit 4: An FAQ of sorts 

Some of you guys are skeptical about my moms reaction, which is completely justified. I'm glad you are, instead of blindly following me, so I'll clear some things up.

Q: Was your uncle on your mother or father's side of the family?
A: he was on my father's side.

Q: Were your mother and uncle close?
A: No, my mother was not close with anyone on my father's side of the family. She hasn't been to a gathering in years, and always blames it on her stomach but I find it hard to believe that every single time we have a reunion (even during Christmas) she has some sort of excuse. She didnt even show up to the funeral 

Q: was your uncle a bad person?
A: absolutely not. He was one of the nicest, kindest people I have ever met. He was recently diagnosed with bipolar, but he was never violent or aggressive like people tend to believe.

Q: was the suicide real?
A: though I have never been directly told, I am almost sure of it. He was diagnosed with bipolar, and was kicked out of his apartment. He spent maybe 6 months or more looking for one, which burned down a couple weeks later. That was the last I heard from him until he died. He had plenty of reasons to end his life, and it answers a lot of questions.

Q:Could she just be laughing because she is grieving?
A: I have seen her grieve before, and I seriously doubt it. Her reaction to my uncle's death was a lot less sincere than other close family members. I understand that some people use humor as a coping mechanism but this time I seriously doubt this is the case.

“Hey, stick your dick in me”

And I was like 

“Fuck it”

And she was like

“Exactly”

So I did and it was ok but then I get this call from her a month later like 

“Hey I’m worried ”

So I was like

“Hey worried, I’m dad”

And she was like 

“How did you know?”

So now I kinda gotta hold down a job while in school and my parents won’t look me in the eye, I think they’re mad but idk.

So I guess this is just a warning, stick your dick in other stuff but women are kinda a no go, it costs a lot of money and it’s not that great.

I finally had enough when she grabbed my crotch (I'm a dude) and tried to overpower me. I hit her and told her to fuck off and the next day I finally opened up to my counselor about her assaulting me and she seemed concerned at first until she talked to my abuser who played the victim and said ""he swore at me and hit me"" which pretty much got her off the hook but got me in a lot of trouble for ""violence"" even though I was defending myself. Even my own parents said ""when teenage girls act out sexually it Usually means they're being abused so its not her fault"" I was so mad when even my own parents weren't on my side. Everyone said I made it up to get attention and she would never do that. and to this day my abuser is a really popular girl at my school and it kills me that she's going to get away with abusing me for the rest of her life.

629,bi7abq,2019-04-28,teenagers,Adios /r/teenagers,"/r/teenagers, you guys are awesome. For the past ~3yrs you’ve provided me with encouragement when I needed it, support during my shittiest of days,and waaaay too many memories to name. This subreddit has always been my favorite community, my favorite to browse, my favorite to participate in, and my favorite to moderate. 

In fact the only reason I ever wanted to mod this place was because of how much I absolutely love it here. I wanted to help this place keep whatever stupid magic it has that enables it to consistently have such a kickass group of /new/ users. Even when one group of users find that the sub no longer appeals to them, another group of lovely people come to take their place. You’d think a sub full of teens would be a mess and well...it is, ngl. But it’s the good kind of mess that always works out in the end. Never have a seen a sub back each other up so much, seen people stand up for each other, look out for each other, and all around be great human beings to one another. You’d hope to see those things all over reddit, but it just isn’t like that.

The sub has changed A LOT over the time I’ve been an active user here. I think when I started coming here we were at 100k subscribers and now we’re over a million. I rebelled during the zero content policy back in 2016, I posted (way too many) selfies in selfie threads, posted my kik in dozens of kik threads (tbt awildjoeyappeared), and made friends who are complete idiots (/u/dullember is forever blacklisted for liking palkia more than dialga). But the core values of this ~~hellhole~~ great place have stayed the same. 

So I leave you with this - Stop posting ama number threads for fucks sake. Or at least if you do, copy and paste the number threads into the body of a post and let *everyone* participate you selfish fucks. Stop posting “screenshot and repost” memes, y’all ain't funny. And when the next big movie comes out, *don’t spoil it* for those who are excited to see it. 

Be nice to the ~~nazis~~ mods. They’re all genuinely great people who I’m so happy I’ve been able to get to know. S/o to /u/Elite_Jackelope, best /r/teenagers mod **EVER**. *ily.* /u/satanslimpdick pls remember to subscribe to pewdiepie. And you’re a great community director, don’t stress over this place too much. You’re doing great. /u/strawberry-sunshine, hiya. All you other slaves, get back to work. <3

I could leave y’all with some cheesy advice rn but this is already long af. I’ve always said that my PM’s are always open to anyone who wants to talk and that will never change. I’m a great emotional punching bag, alright conversationalist, okay advice giver, and if all starts going south then I have a large album of animal pictures that I can spam you with to make you smile.

Hello love-seekers, welcome to my guide.

&#x200B;

1. It takes patience, talk to them everyday, and don't let the conversation die down (But don't push it too much, it can lead to failure, requested by u/NorthStar6-4 ) , let it be talking in IRL, on call or in texts.
2. Complement them. But only say honest things: for example ""You look great today"" if she took extra effort to get ready that day, or ""Your hair is really nice and soft"" if you can see that she takes care of her hair. Also compliment not only her physical traits but also her personality, for example: ""You are very smart, hardworking, kind"" (Personality contribution by u/WonszykReczny
3. Be funny. I understand this may not be easy for some idiots on here that just say ""haha get rick rolled noob funny poopy"",  but try to make smart jokes. Look on r/cardsagainsthumanity for some real funny shit. But make the jokes at the right time, like if her grandmother died, don't say: ""Well, you have another one"".
4. Listen to them. Really listen to what they have to say, pay attention to what they tell you. And reply to it with your real opinion, you want them to like you for who you are, not for some fake personality.
5. Talk to them about personal things. If you have any family problems, (Ok I can't think of anything personal but just pretend I did)
6. Don't rush it. Take your time, it won't just happen 2 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes and 21 seconds after you start talking to her. I was talking to this girl for months on end, and it looked like nothing was going to happen
7. Give physical and emotional support. If they are sad, hug them and try to help their problem, they will really appreciate it!
8. Treat them like a human being, don't treat them like a goddess, they are not.  (By u/ i lost the person pls send me a message)
9. If they aren't meeting you half way save yourself the emotional embarrassment and leave them. Obviously at first it'll be one sided but if it doesn't quickly turn into equal care it's not worth it.  (By u/ i lost the person pls send me a message)
10. Love yourself before you love a partner, getting in a relationship when you can't even bare your own personality *WILL* lead to a trainwreck. (By u/ i lost the person pls send me a message)

TLDR: Read the whole post you lazy bugger

Ok thank you for coming to my TED Talk, now you have what it takes to get a girlfriend. This might work on genetically modified sheep but it is not confirmed!

Edit: Feel free to write any suggested modification to this text down below!

Edit 2: Don't do self pity, for example: ""Oh I can never get a girlfriend!"" (Suggested by u/between_3_and20 )

They ask if you can show them, so you dig out your ancient 2024 gaming pc and boot it up. The windows 11 theme brings a tear to your eye. you open up chrome and type in 'reddit'. An archived site, long abandoned appears. Posting is disabled, but as with all social media sites that were archived, it was still possible to log in an access your old account. 

You type in your username and password. Its incorrect. Of course, you forgot to capitalize the 'o's. You try again and you are brought to the now defunct frontpage, displaying the top posts of all time in the ugly reddit 2021 redesign. You click your profile, leading your family through this internet time machine. You were last here 35 years ago...

You remember how you began to grow older, and your usage of reddit became more sporadic with time. You decide to avoid all the newer stuff about school and uni and jobs, and skip back to when you were 16. You search for the last comment you made on r/teenagers, the last time you were free from responsibility. Here it is. Your family sit quiet as a mouse. They look upon the screen, and see these words written in an age long gone:

""r/emojipolice, put your hands where I can see them!!!""

They bring a tear to your eye as you imagine how much this comment must've meant to the recipient. The silence is broken by a clap. And another, and another. Slowly the whole room fills with applause. You look around and see your grandkids crying. A man from the government walks in, gifting you a medal of honour. 

You tear up. You had done it. You are a real hero.

Today we are celebrating with my gf our first month together, so we planned to spend all the day in her house. I arrived at her house at 8 a.m, when her dad was working already. So long story short, we were in her bed in her bedroom, when all of a sudden we heard that the door of her bedroom opened and the domestic employee was standing in there. The three of us looked very amazed and confused and she said ""Oh, sorry, I didn't know that there was anyone in the house"" and she left the room. In that moment my gf dressed up and told me to stay in her bed while she was going to talk to the employee.
So I started browsing Reddit to kill the boredom. While I was doing that, I heard a new voice in the house, her dad. Immediately I got dressed up and hid under her bed, waiting for her to come.
When she got to the room, she told me to hid in her closet and stay quiet till her dad left the house.
So I'm here now, hiding in a small closet while her dad is in the house. 
Wish me luck.

UPDATE OF THE SITUATION: I could escape and go back to her bed, but the story didn't end there, because her dad came AGAIN to the house, so I had to hid again in the closet totally nude.  In one moment, he entered the room and opened one door of the closet I was in, but he couldn't see me. I'm shaking right now because it just happened.

647,dqlc3p,2019-11-02,teenagers,My home is being destroyed.,"I am a teen born and raised in Hong Kong. Where it used to be a free and safe place, at least before June, where the majority of people here were nice and peaceful. I had faith in those who work to protect the city, making my home secure from damger. it was my pride to be a Hongkonger. But one summer changed the whole city, the government lied to us, forces attacked us, brainwashed people turning their backs to their community, organizing terror attacks. The protests were no longer focusing on political issue but injustice.



Those who joined the police force and swore to protect and keep hk safe betrayed their city. Teaming with thugs beating up protesters who were only seeking for their rightful freedom and justice. Humiliating detainees, raping, murdering are all on their list, done without consequnces. Hiding the truth, misleading the public, giving excuses to their unnecessary violent actions. I can't even think of any words to decribe their evilness.



And yet I can't do anything to stop them, I am powerless. As all I could do is to join assembly and boycott certain pro ccp stores. Everyday i wake up, only to see innocent people being attacked by armed police using violent forces. Including breaking the arm of a first aider, arresting the parents of a boy for unlawful assembly(there were barely 10 people there), leaving the child behind crying alone, beating up protestors until his spine broke....... I've never felt so much fear, not fearing the protestors but the police who is jeopardizing the future of hk, the future of the next generation. It feels like I'm being tied onto a chair while helplessly watching my house burning down into pieces. I fear for tomorrow. Will I be arrested for joining anti-government assembly, then get beaten up til im covered in blood or they kill me and fake my suicide. I can't even remember the last time I felt happiness and calmness in my city. 



The suppression from the totalitarian government is indeed scary. And I hate to see my fellow people being repressed, basic human rights being snatched away, while some overpowered and misled people cheer and celebrate such tradgedy. These days you could be arrested for doing anything, bring a laser pen, gas masks or even passing by protests.

Yes, sometimes I can be annoyed with the things that come out of this sub but overall I am happy and proud of you all. 

Before I forever transition out of being a teenager I wanted to leave you all with some advice that I have learned as I have gone through life. (I apologize for any typos. Typing as an American all of these things might not apply) I do not have the handbook for life, not everything will apply 100% to you or those around you.  My life isn’t yours. It I have watched and learned from people and life and found that these things may help

**Intentionally cultivate your interests** . As you try to navigate life the only thing you truly have is yourself. If you spend your time doing things arbitrarily, when rubber meets the road you will be left behind, and it will not feel good, and you will know it. This will help you become valuable to the world in terms of jobs, friendships, intrinsic confidence, dating, and long term joy.  Well trained and cared for animals and being able to cook good food make you appealing in the dating world and keep life interesting. If you can, learn a language and try out music. I promise life with those two things is so much more fulfilling. Work hard, work with a goal in mind, work intelligently and work well. Know you value, you are a person, not a capitalist number. You work to live, not vice versa. Don’t worry about being a part of the latest trend of popular things. Be yourself because only you have to live life being you.

**Emotions** - as a teenager your emotions and logic are bound to be like a frantic squirrel bouncing around a cage. This makes it difficult for anyone to instill any sort of logic/ discipline into you, especially if you are a younger teenager. Listen carefully even when you feel you are being wronged or like no one understands you. It could be the difference between you having to learn the hurtful way, and succeeding. Do not quarrel unnecessarily. Do not be easily offended. Learn to not take things personally and understand you are not the most important person in the world. Understand that people believe in different things and this doesn’t make them bad, even if they offend you. It makes the world what it is, dynamic, and diverse. Learn to objectively view your emotions, and write them down. It will help you analyze them and push forward in life. It it won’t matter in a year or so don’t fret over it. Be confident in yourself. If you have confident issues act like you own the place. Never let your emotions make you act in ways that can be deemed foolish. Never take your own life. No matter how upset you are. Emotions are fluid and they will pass. Grief is aweful but it does get better. So are hard and good times. Never let “love” make you do stupid things. I write this as an incredibly stressed and somewhat depressed young man. My mind is enveloped in my feelings and I feel like it won’t end. It will, and life will become joyful again. Something I live by is “if you feel like your going through hell act like you own the place”. It is best to stay away from all substances regardless of how “natural” they are. I have learned that every single person I have watched used any sort of substances, especially to help regulate emotions/or remove them from the pain of reality has either died, or destroyed their life by themselves or with others. 

**Respect**- give everyone the respect they don’t deserve. Reddit doesnt give me enough room to express how much this has not only saved my butt from bad situations, but elevated me above my peers even when I don’t deserve it. From that insignificant person at the gas station to the principal of your school, give them the same respect you would if your life was in their hands. From potential legal trouble, to getting recommended by the teachers I despised, my dedication to loving my neighbor has helped me win more than I should have. Do not let anyone walk over you. Remove yourself from bad situations respectfully, always know your worth, always keep your cool and make sure you are not taken advantage of. Stand up for those who need help. Do not gossip, speak well of others and avoid those who don’t. Respect everyone regardless of their beliefs, life choices, physical or mental attributes, sexuality, religion, nationality, origin, political leaning etc even if they make you uncomfortable. The actions of most people disagree, however I can attest that people have an amazing ability to rally around and help those who are different than them, if they they feel that person makes an effort to be good to them. Reputation is everything, you come into this world with nothing, and leave with only that. Listen more than you speak

**You live by cancel culture you WILL die by cancel culture** No one lives to escape its devious grasps. Give grace to those even if you don’t think they deserve it. We all have our skeletons in the closet

**Fighting** - avoid fights at all costs. Unless you are backed into a corner and your safety is on the line avoid them. Remember this one saying, “most people don’t want to fight you, they want to hit you”- Joe Rogan. Choose your battles and carefully and keep this in mind. Being considered a wimp as a teenager matters as much as a fart in a field. Fights are dangerous and leave people maimed and dead regularly. People don’t care these days and they like to see others hurt. They are not worth the legal trouble or loss of reputation. If you must fight to avoid bullying make sure it is 10000% unavoidable and worth it. I personally have fought bullies and almost been arrested. My bullies stopped and I avoided legal trouble bc my administration knew me as highly respectful. Unfortunately, you are not in your parents' time. The poor choices you make now will be seared into society’s memories and follow you for eternity. If you must fight, fight justly, with unavoidable reason and with confidence. Swing with a closed fist, thumb closed up and resting underneath your palm(NOT STICKING OUT), using the bottom of your palm/wrist to strike will also work, protect your chin, DO NOT FIGHT ON HARD SURFACES, ladies ball up your hair. Don’t go to the ground unless you know how. Your punches will feel like jelly but that is your adrenaline helping you not feel as much pain. Jiu jitsu and Muay Thai kick boxing are often revered as the most practical and most worth your money for training. I can attest to this as well.

(If you live in an environment that forces you to fight often, you know better than I do, and my best advice is to fight with good fundamentals. Use discernment and avoid bad situations.) 

**Discipline**- discipline is the difference between those who succeed vs those who fail in life. Master your urges so that you do not need to itch them. Including and especially sexual urges even if it is difficult. They will take you further than you wanna go and can lead to many bad things in life including wasted time and medical problems. Rid yourself of your vices. Do not be reckless, have fun, live is too short to be reserved by calculate your choices. Despite what people might say, do not chase sex with droves of people even in your young years, enjoy it with the one person who matter most. Those who are guided by sex, I have typically watched, ruin their lives legally, socially, and they begin to sexualization everything. It makes them repulsive to everyone, even if those around them don’t mention it. Life is way better when you aren’t looking at everything and everyone through horny eyes. Wake up at a reasonable time and get life started, even if its reading or working out. Eat well and exercise to the best of your abilities, this will pay off later. Stop making excuses, make a change. Schedule your life in a writing and budget. Living arbitrarily leads to forgetfulness, failure and mistakes. Your death and the life remembered will likely be a 100% reflection of your life. Your habits almost always control your destiny and your death.

**Quality over quantity**- this applies to everything in life. This is most included in friendships. Do not chase the “popular kid” life. They typically flop after highschool or college. Find a few good friends in life who aim to help you succeed. Do not align yourself with fringe online ideologies. If you need help with dating, or life in general , find a wise older person/mentor in your life to give you quality wisdom, not a comment section filled with tons of ideas unspecific to your life and reality. Cultivate your relationships. People are here for a season. Nothing is permanent. Tell your people you love them and always keep them in your heart. When the world rejects you or the heat turns up, all you have are close family and friends. Quality over quantity.

**Your future** I live in a western world where college is pushed on young people. I do not know what it is like for those not in a western nation so I apologize if this is unrelatable. Do not allow yourself to be force fed into the school to college machine, unless you are more than certain it is for you. Overall, when planning your future it can be scary. It can be hard to try and do risk assessment. It is for this reason that it is crucial to have the wisdom of those whose lives speak with actions. They can help you, no one can do it alone, not even you. If it helps, when making decisions try to think long term. See which option has the best long term results, and then research how badly it would affect your life if that option failed. Weigh them. Use the wise opinions of others with lives that prove their value. The world and their opinion is constantly changing. It is best to have a stable moral compass that can survive the fluidity of the world’s right and wrong. Many people find religion to be helpful in this manner. Me personally a Christ follower. But to each his own

Also, it helps learn how to be handy and fix things. Learn how they work so repairmen can’t scam you

**Edit: I think I’ll add my two cents on dating after some requests**
This all depends on culture, place of origin, sexuality and desires but I have found this relatively true. I am a straight male in a western world so and this is what I have learned. Nothing comes from a place of hurt or intention to offend

**Assuming you are a straight guy** I’d advise you to see what attracts women. Women are the queens of what women want. However what they often say may be slightly different from what their beliefs in practice say. Take this with a grain of salt. Make friends with women and it will help you learn from them. They, like anyone can be ridiculous at times so being around them will help you get first hand experience. Regardless of what the “I’m so woke and kind and I love everyone and everything is love” fake people tell you, the vast majority of women have strong preferences. Although all are not the same the vast majority like relatively in shape men who can provide and protect to some extent along with making her feel loved and appreciated. Low self esteem gets you nowhere with them. **THEY ARE PEOPLE NOT OBJECTS. They are daughters and mothers etc. Do not use them for sex or gratification. They will know and never trust you if you do this. A big fuck you to those who use women for their own pleasure** Douchebags tend to use “alpha a beta” when describing men. Women tend to be more sensitive than men so keep this in mind. (Look up spaghetti girls, waffle guys. It may give you some insight) Some combo of all this. Build yourself up in these areas. so remember don’t focus your life around getting laid or else it may come back to bite you in the butt, badly. My personal preference is to wait until marriage. If that’s not for you I won’t force it on you but I’ve learned it’s best to keep your body count as low as possible, even women don’t like man hoes. In practice even the most modern and feminist women like traditionalist men who ask women out and pay for dates. Avoid the virtue signaling new age stuff and stick to what is tried and true. As Kanye West once said, “one good girl is worth a thousand bitches”, that is absolute facts. **DO NOT ATTACH YOURSELF TO FRINGE DATING IDEOLOGIES LIKE MGTOW, INCEL, ETC**. Bad people exist just like good people. Yes I will generalize and tell you that it will make you despise women and see them as a scourge on the Earth, they are not your enemy, they are your friends and partners. If you dislike or generalize the other sex, you have failed, miserably at life itself. **Use a mentor to help you navigate. I’m barely older than you and a older women or man’s advice may better suit you!** 

**For my straight western ladies**
Men typically like fit and friendly women who are happy. We do not care if you have a PHD or a college. We want a good companion who will help us along in life. We are simple and don’t think as complicated as you all. The world is tough on us and being able to have a loving companion who lets us be vulnerable secretly means the world to us. Do not let the rampant porn culture than is plaguing men make you insecure about your bodies. Find a man who is invested in you, not women on a screen. Never settle but don’t have unrealistic expectations and standards. No one is intimated by a strong woman or man for that matter. If you say this you have already failed. It is likely your disposition. Same goes for men. Sometimes men get uncomfortable rejecting you and it comes off as fearful. Men are the Kings of what men want, NOT WOMEN. Many western women think it’s their place to convince men to like what they believe they should like. Investing your energy in building yourself according to reality, not Twitter belief systems, this is how you move to the front of the line. Genuine apologies mean the world to us as many of us are taught to take BS from women without resisting. We won’t be vulnerable around you unless we trust you. If you go behind our backs with our deep feelings we will never forget, even if we forgive.  The best way to know what men want is to be around men and learn from them. Securing women’s rights is your right as a human, however, I feel confident in generalizing to say avoid or be cautious around any 3rd and later wave of feminism. Many parts of it will convince you to despise men. Men are your partners in life, not enemies. Bad people are bad, good are good. If you despise or generalize one gender if people you have failed miserably at life. An older wise mentor will give better more specific vice than I can. Message me if you need anything else. Good luck 

Good luck to you all, I love you all and hope you win at this wild and wondrous game we all call life.",bigbutterdawg,t2_aobknoxw,0.95,16204,386
652,o2p3o6,2021-06-18,teenagers,A girl harassed my best friend and I snapped at her.,"Today was the last day of school where I live, I was at the recess with my best friend while we waited for the bell to ring.

A girl from my class came up to us, she was usually nice to us so we didn't mind it that much.

That is, until she started ""jokingly"" touching his nipples with a bit of strength while saying that his ""Man-tits"" were nice and big. 

At the first or second time, he laughed it off, but after she did it more and more times, I started to notice his discomfort.

I've known the dude for 9 years now, when he's forcing himself to not cry his face goes totally serious, his mouth closes pretty hard and he just stares away from the problem while his body just balances left to right. 

Lo and behold, he was meeting all of the above.

I said: ""I think you should stop, he isn't liking that at all, that's harassment, you know?""

Then, she said: ""I don't care!""

Then she did it once more, he tried to back away, but he was right on the wall, so she ended up hitting him again.

When she went to touch him once more, I realize that he was almost at the point of crying.

FYI, he gets scared of crying in public, he fears that people will laugh at him, so that's why he tries to force a straight face.

Knowing that, I snapped, grabbed her arm by the wrist and pulled it away from him, hurting her a bit, I think.

She got angry and shouted: ""What the fuck! I wasn't messing with you!""

And then I shouted back: ""You were hurting him, so yes, you were messing with me!""

She then went away (She stayed angry at me for the whole day) and I started tearing up.

I don't like using brute force to do anything.

I hate to hurt anyone, but i just had to help my friend after seeing him being treated like that.

Please, women harassing men is not something that can be ignored.

If you know anyone that's going through this shit, please, help them in any way possible.

Edit: Hello, thanks a lot to everyone supporting me and my friend on here, be it through comments or awards, even though I'm thankful, I do not think you should be calling me a King nor awarding me with awards, I did not make this post for those, I've hurt someone physically, a thing I regret doing when I could have done better.

I made this post to *maybe* inspire someone that reads it to help their own friends if ever needed

If you want to show that you think that i did a good thing, please, do this yourselves, protect someone in need, be them Man, Woman or Non-Binary.

Sexual harassment happens to any gender, so please, help other people in need.

Again, I thank you a lot for the kind words and awards *(Even if I think it isn't necessary)* , I've spoken to my friend via discord after I got home, he's well now, for those asking.

Again, please, just do the right thing and protect other person, even if you don't know them.",GravitateOG,t2_3ds3t30l,0.93,16179,842

655,m3f0ue,2021-03-12,teenagers,"ANALYSIS: op claims 14 year old girls got teacher fired, but only gives his side of story","#context

post is in hot right now, op claims 14 year old girls reported 70 year old male teacher for absolutely no reason,

comments are going absolutely insane wishing death, bullying and general harassment towards the 14 year old girls

but they have only seen ops side of the story, which needs more context that is not there

we don't know why they reported the teacher, even op has no idea


#from op's own words:

""I don’t know why, they just didn’t like him. The only instance I recall was when one of them was wearing fishnets and twerking and so he said to stop because it could distract boys or something, and she complained to admin that he called her a whore""

why did they ""just not like him""?  why would someone hate on a teacher for no reason? op claims the teacher was a great mentor so why would someone hate this great mentor for no reason?? there is another side to this story


#here's what i think of it:

a teacher getting fired must mean they did something pretty bad to get fired

op, a guy, claims that The teacher was great and taught him well,

however as we can see the teacher gets angry at a 14 year old girl wearing fishnets, which are an acceptable clothing item by modern standards, ok i understand that if she was twerking he has a right to stop her, but listen to exactly what he said....

the teacher tells her to ""stop distracting the boys""

and he is also a 70 year old man

now i dont like jumping on conclusions, but op has absolutely zero idea why he was actually fired, for all we know he could be a great teacher to the boys and a sexist towards the girls, which is why the girls reported him?

op also claims they ""lied and bribed the administration""? there is no evidence of such things, op is saying that for no reason as far as i can see


#conclusion:

im not supporting the girls, and im not supporting the op either, im just trying to do an analysis of this strange situation... and this is just my own personal opinion which you have a right to argue and disagree with 👍



this is not the first time an old teacher has turned out to be a sexist and treating boys and girls differently

and redditors love hating on teenage girls, lets not forget that


#edit 3 hours later

the original post has been deleted

sorting by controversial comments, it's really horrible to see all the hate, death threats, bullying, name calling towards some teenage girls 

some want to beat them, some want to shoot them or throw them in jail, someone said that he wants to ""suffocate those girls"" and someone said they should ""get their alt asses beat till they're blue"", another person said that we all should get together and take this to the media and put the pictures of those girls on posters, someone said that this is why ""bitches don't deserve rights""



#this is literally why girls (and boys) are afraid to report abusers, these people are the exact reason why




#edit 2:

just before deleting the post, op has posted a series of transphobic comments.... i think we all know the truth about op now....

664,fr1izb,2020-03-29,teenagers,My friend died today.,"I don't know where else to post this. One of my best friends, george, died this morning. He was found in his room, unresponsive. They say the cause of death is unknown. He had a whole life ahead of him. In July, he was going to join the Marines. He was a smart guy, he was the kindest person I have ever known. He was goofy, funny and in general a very fun person. I found out about 4 hours ago.  I can't even imagine what it's like for his parents, and his brother and two sisters. All of my thoughts and prayers are going out to them right now. They are such a nice family and they don't deserve this. George didn't deserve this. George was gonna graduate this year. It was too soon. Way too soon.

Edit: I want to respond to you all, but theres too many, so I guess I'll answer some of the most asked questions here. I don't  know how he died. And if I find out, I'm not going to update it here. I think it would be disrespectful. No, this is not a fake post. I wish it was. I really wish this was fake, but it's not.

Also, fuck all of you downvote farmers, and the guy who gave me the ""I'm deceased"" award. I lost a friend and you didn't even have the decency to respect him, so you turn it into a joke.

I hope you will follow them, or at least learn from them, thats all I want, you all deserve to be happy

1 - Listen to your parents, I know it sounds stupid, but in most cases they will be right - but don't forget you must listen to yourself also, take your parents' advice, they are there to help you in life

2 - If you feel a friend has bad influence on you - just let them go, memories last, sometimes forever, but being in a toxic company is way worse, I've been forced to do things mainly because others in my company were thinking it's ''cool''

3 - Take relationships seriously, since I am a guy, I can talk about guys, don't break girls' hearts, be good, if you get hurt, don't become ''that guy'', you know what I talk about, remember the nice things and move on

4 - Music will be your friend, don't ever be ashamed to listen to music you enjoy just because others hate on it

5 - Live life to it's fullest, time flies, I remember the times when me and my friends were playing Minecraft all night long, sleeping late for school because of that our friend died in the cave and we had to find his items

6 - If you believe you got some kind of mental illness, talk to your parents, if they do not take you seriously in first place, take your time to make the conversation serious, your mental health is a priority!!

7 - Don't compare to others, you are unique

8 - This is a really important one - DON'T DO DRUGS, especially hard ones (since a lot of people asked me about drugs in the comments - if you wanna try, be responsible and take care! Remove any sharp objects nearby, choose a nice company, enjoy the moment, don't overdo it - it wont end up in anything good, take care everyone!)

9 - Sadly, the chances of you still being friends with the people you are friends with now - are very low, I am in contact with about 5-6, 1 or 2 of which I can trust my life

10 - Stop obsessing with what you look on the outside, yea, I know, we all got that facial feature we hate, most people do not even notice

11 - If a friend of yours seems sad or depressed, talk to them, sometimes a few nice words can save a life!!

12 - USE CONDOMS!! Not only about pregnancy, there are tons of others who got STDs, keep yourself save

13 - Just don't smoke, it's not cool, you smell like ashtray - save up those money and learn investing

14 - Workout, fitness is great, it builds not only muscles, also your character and discipline

15 - Be responsible, you must realize that words/actions may affect someone's life heavily - also yours

16 - Play Minecraft from time to time, especially if you can invite friends in the server, this will build your friendship!

17 - My favorite number, also fav year, when I was 17 my life literally changed''360 degrees no scope''  (this means it whooped me and made me rethink the way I live) - thats for those who do not understand why I used it that way- You need to understand that, life won't always be easy and happy, there will be days you will cry to be over, keep pushing, never give up!

18 - Be responsible when driving, at 18 most of you will get their driving license, don't speed.. take your time to learn, practice is a must

and last one

19 - School is not teaching you the things you must know in life, to some point makes you stupid, I said it, same for university, it also kills artists and people with real talent, studying is important, but improving your skills outside of school is absolutely a must!If you ask a tiger and a fish to climb a tree, the fish will live it's life thinking it's worthless and stupid!! Same on the other side if you ask a tiger to swim in the deep ocean, find what you are good at, get better at it and rock life, also try to make some cash on the way to the top!

A player who previously got falsely accused and ejected striked a conversation with- ""welcome to the club"". We started chatting and both became good buddies in the game and she then mentioned that she's a girl. We both promised that we will not leave that game. We played for a while and were really enjoying each other's company.

But,

when a new game started she was'nt there . I don't know what actually happened, but I felt bad. I looked through random public servers for 15 mins in hopes to find her, but i failed. 

So, yeah i'm pretty sad right now.

I was playing with the name 'big pp'. So if you see this, white girl, then dm me.

>SO we can afford this but not Medicare for All? Okay. Yeah, thanks.

Pretty basic distinction here, this action was undertaken by the Federal Reserve, which is *not* the same thing as the federal government. The Federal Reserve does not need to raise money from taxpayers, they have the authority to create new money for these operations.

Also, the Federal Reserve does not handle healthcare policy.

>Nothing cause the dumb fuckers listened to Trump and dropped the rate twice before this shit even hit just trying to eek out a bit more money for greedy mother fuckers. There is zero reason the rates should have been anywhere below 5% before this when our economy and stocks were booming.

Suggesting that interest rates should of been above 5% is ridiculous. The Federal Reserve does not control the natural rate of interest, they merely accommodate it. The Fed doesn't just set interest rates at whatever number they think sounds nice. The natural rate of interest pre-COVID-19 was surely not above 5%. The [Laubach-Williams model](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar) estimates the real natural rate of interest was around 0.5-1 percent in the time period leading up the COVID-19 shock. This would of put the nominal natural interest rate at 2.5 to 3 percent (assuming about 2% inflation). In any case, this is significantly below 5%.

Now perhaps this person was agreeing with economists like Larry Summers that think the inflation target should be increased so we could lift the nominal interest rate further from the zero-lower bound. Somehow though, I do not think that was the case.

>US Government can afford anything they want

That is *not* what QE is. QE is the Fed conducting a large-scale purchase of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities to attempt to push down longer-term interest rates.

The Federal Reserve is not giving money to the government. This person seems to be describing a helicopter money/debt monetization scenario, which is entirely different (and also not what the Federal Reserve is doing right now).

671,l7gi70,2021-01-29,badeconomics,"Financial Econ 101, or: Link this in bad Reddit threads about GME","I am going to explain, as I have several times over the past few days, what the hell is happening with GME. I will edit in a link to literally half the internet if someone asks, but everyone should know at this point that most of the descriptions of what is happening are transparently wrong.

Let us start with an overview of how shorts work. You own a security. You loan that security to your broker. Your broker loans that security to a short seller. The short seller sells the loaned security at the current market price to a short buyer and plans to buy it back at a later date at the market price then. Their profit is (sale price - buy price) - interest. 

Here's the first bit of bad economics. GME's short interest - the proportion of shares sold short relative to outstanding shares on the market - is (or, as of the latest info, was) above 1. That means that more shares were shorted than exist. Some people are claiming that this has literally anything to do with a naked short. This is not true. A naked short is when, instead of borrowing a security, the short seller just... says they have the security and sells something they don't have. This is very illegal, unless you're a market maker. This is also very detectable, as the buyer *does not receive any shares*.

Now, you may ask, ""how can more shares be shorted than exist?"" The answer is simple. The short buyer now has a long position on the equity. The short buyer's broker can than borrow those stocks and loan them to a new short seller - or, maybe, the same short seller. An unlimited number of short sales can be performed on a single stock, and none of these shorts will be naked.

Furthermore you may ask, ""why does a short squeeze happen?"" A short squeeze happens because the short seller is required by the broker to keep a certain amount of money in their margin account, so that the broker can be reasonably sure they won't get fucked if the share price goes to the moon and the short seller can't afford to buy back the stock. If the price goes up and margin requirements increase, the short sellers will be forced to either dump more money in or to close their short positions by buying back the stock. Because the price has gone up, the second alternative means the short sellers will lose money. When the short interest is above 1, this means that if the price goes up *at all*, there's a decent change it will trigger a buying frenzy, since the amount of stock all the short sellers have to buy to cover their position is greater than the number of stocks that are out there. To be very clear: the inflated share price of GME is a bubble. Everyone involved should be **very** aware that it is a bubble. The price is going up because, right now, everyone would like to buy GME. That means that eventually the price will explosively deflate when the short interest drops enough and there isn't so much pressure to buy.

I should note here that margin calls - when the broker asks someone to pony up, or they'll seize their margin account and close out their positions - are very, very bad for the person getting margin called. The broker can do this when the short seller's maintenance margin falls below a threshold without their input or consent. They don't give a fuck. They want the stock that the short seller promised to give back to them, so that they can give it to you, the person who loaned it to them. This means that if any of the institutional investors can't meet a margin call, the price is going to explode because the broker will sell as much of the fund's assets as it needs to in order to buy the stock back.

Now that we understand what a short squeeze actually is, we can talk about who's getting fucked here, which is the second bit of bad economics.

To start with, retail longs are not getting fucked. They loaned their stocks to the broker, and brokers have more than enough money to deal with even some very large short accounts failing to be able to give them back the stock they borrowed.

The brokers are getting a little fucked. They do, however, charge interest on the stock loans, which means that some amount of defaulting is priced in, and this is not where most of their money comes from. It could be painful but not terrible.

The short sellers, in this case hedge funds, are getting very fucked. Every dollar the stock climbs is 50 cents per share they need to scrounge up for the margin account, or else the brokers set off the bomb. They can try to raise this cash by diluting shares or borrowing money, but they're carrying boatloads of toxic assets and they'll get terms that reflect that.

The retail investors who bought recently and don't have an exit strategy aren't *as* fucked, since all they can lose is what they originally put in, but unless they're smart about their exit strategy, they'll get at least a little fucked. Stonks go down after the bubble pops, and this is a bubble. When enough shorts unwind (see above), the demand will go down and so will the price.

Now, what are the distributional impacts here?

If institutions - not the funds getting fucked, but other institutions - are front-running retail, they'll make out like bandits. If the bomb does go off, exiting before GME crashes will be like catching a falling knife while wearing a fursuit.

Any retail investors who develop an exit strategy and execute before the price starts to fall will make even more money than the HFT guys front-running the detonation.

Any retail investors who got in at $400 and get out at $60 will... lose exactly that much money.

The hedge funds will go insolvent if the bomb goes off. This is likely to make the people that run them unemployed, but is unlikely to make them, personally, poor. Their clients, though, could lose everything.

So, the mega-rich will get richer, a few WSB experts will get filthy stinking rich, and most of the people bandwagoning over the last day will be fucked, but only out of what they put in. The Gamestop investors who have been holding since last year and haven't taken any profits will have come out fine on the other side of the ride of their lives. The global financial system won't collapse, unless some systemic deleveraging happens because this shit is 3spooky5wall street.

Now, is this market manipulation? Almost certainly not. The dynamics of the short squeeze don't depend on privileged information and fraudulent claims are not being made.

672,musne8,2021-04-20,badeconomics,Disproving the vacant homes myth,"Some on the left (and right!-it's a problem across the political spectrum) use the existence of vacant housing as justification for opposing building more homes.  This is, unfortunately, a frequent occurrence, whether you're a [socialist politician in SF](https://twitter.com/DeanPreston/status/1301006701244473344) or a [random twitter person](https://twitter.com/stevanzetti/status/1377833525639004160?s=20) but for this post I'll focus on yesterday's semi-viral tweet from TYT producer Ana Kasparian:

>[""America is short of homes"" is a strange focus when foreign capital and private equity funds are snatching up all available housing for their portfolios. I'm sick of hearing about the ""shortage of housing"" as homes owned by people who don't even live in the US sit empty.](https://twitter.com/AnaKasparian/status/1384144782428033024)

Here's the R1 with all the reasons that using vacancies as a justification for not building more homes is wrong:


* **Most vacancies aren’t where people want to live**

As seen in [this map](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ex_XDgrUUAAz6V7?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) constructed from US Census data, the highest vacancy rates are in low-demand places: primarily rural areas with few good job opportunities. On the other hand, you can see that **the lowest vacancy rates are in high-demand areas on the West Coast and Northeast**. 

*Telling someone who works in the Bay Area that there’s an abandoned home in Detroit or Lubbock that they can move into isn’t a solution.*


* **Vacancies are not all the same**

According to census data, half of vacancies in a housing-constrained city like LA are “market vacancies”, which are *[“the inevitable gaps in tenancy that occur when a lease is ended, a home goes on the market to be resold, or a new building opens and hasn’t yet leased or sold all its units”](https://www.lewis.ucla.edu/research/does-the-los-angeles-region-have-too-many-vacant-homes/).* Unless you think it’s possible for new housing to be 100% sold the day it is built, and that each tenant that moves out is instantly replaced by one who moves in, these vacancies are to be expected.

For the rest of vacancies (non-market vacancies), there are a wide range of reasons including renovations, foreclosures, and condemned properties. **The number of homes that are intentionally left vacant due to market speculation is quite low, and it makes sense — the way that landlords make money is by renting out homes, so keeping them vacant means foregone income.**


* **Higher vacancy rates = downwards pressure on rents**

Landlords love low vacancy rates because it gives them more market power. This makes sense — landlords have a monopoly on existing housing, and the last thing they want is to face more competition. But don’t take my word for it, here’s Blackstone (a massive private equity firm) [admitting in their annual report that high vacancy rates reduce their profit margins](https://twitter.com/IDoTheThinking/status/1378737834824060931?s=20). 

This could be seen in [data from SF during the pandemic, as vacancy rates skyrocketed and rents fell significantly](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/S-F-renters-gain-rare-leverage-in-pandemic-with-15754770.php). I even personally experienced this firsthand during the pandemic: our upstairs neighbors left and our landlord had to lower the rent to find a new tenant. We used the new lower rent for the upstairs unit along with the wide range of cheaper apartments on the market as leverage, and received a 10% rent reduction.


* **A vacancy rate of zero is… not a good thing**

Housing is like a sliding puzzle — zero vacancies would prevent people from moving anywhere.  **Imagine a world with no housing vacancies.** Like, actually try to envision it. The only way you could move is by finding someone else to swap houses with. Immigration? Forget about it. Want your kids to move out of the house? Sorry, you’re out of luck.

Our country is growing, and we should try to welcome all of those who want to live here. Furthermore, many marginalized communities view left-leaning cities like SF as a mecca where they can escape persecution. *We shouldn’t let a lack of homes shut people out and prevent them from living where they want.*
And what’s the worst thing that happens if we end up building too many homes? Landlords will be tripping over each other to lower rent and compete for tenants — sounds pretty good to me!


* **Vacancy taxes can be somewhat effective, but they’re far from a silver bullet**

Vancouver actually implemented a vacancy tax in 2017 and it went… okay. The tax was 1% of the property value for each year in which the property was left unoccupied a majority of the time. The next year, the number of vacancies fell from 1,085 to 922. Yes, it was a significant 15% drop, but it was also *only 163 homes that were returned to the market.*  (more data can be found on page 14 here: https://escholarship.org/content/qt87r4543q/qt87r4543q.pdf?t=q5c4jp) 

In Vancouver, a city with 310K homes and a severe housing shortage, 163 homes is great, but pales in comparison to the tens of thousands of homes that are needed. Furthermore, the tax raised ~$20–$35M/year, enough to subsidize ~100 affordable homes.

Ironically, **the benefits from a vacancy tax (more homes on the market, including more affordable homes) could be achieved at far greater scale by simply… legalizing more housing.**
So yes, there are plenty of left-YIMBYs who support vacancy taxes (I’m one of them), but we can’t let it distract us from the broader housing shortage. Rather, vacancy taxes are, at best, a small-scale, incremental tweak around the edges for an issue that requires big, bold solutions.


**P.S.**: While I think vacancy trutherism is the most pervasive left-NIMBY myth, **I wrote a long medium effortpost making the affirmative case for YIMBYism from a progressive perspective** that you may find interesting if you've made it this far through the post! https://medium.com/@samdeutsch/housing-for-all-the-case-for-progressive-yimbyism-e41531bb40ec",samdman,t2_49ov3,0.97,1114,206

Who cares, because the commenters don't.","Reddit post: https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/e1fmtm/economists_say_forgiving_student_debt_would_boost/

Original article: https://news.wgcu.org/post/economists-say-forgiving-student-debt-would-boost-economy

Headline:

> Economists Say Forgiving Student Debt Would Boost Economy

This was flaired with ""site altered headline"", since the original site headline is now slightly different:

> Forgiving Student Debt Would Boost Economy, Economists Say

The comment section of /r/politics is frothing at this news: *of course it would.  More spending money for ~~me~~ college graduates means more money spent in the economy = better economy.  Airtight.*  The comment section of the thread, sorted by top, is filled with these replies reiterating this point in many different ways, from more respectable but incomplete arguments that the transfer of wealth would be a net good, to individual anecdotes, down to the usual lopsided caricatures of reality.  Unfortunately, the article's headline is incredibly misleading.

I'm going to preface this with saying that I'm not an economist, so I'd appreciate any correction or addition to this.  I tried to avoid making strong blanket statements on certain topics, particularly the notion of home ownership and tax rates, because I don't want to open myself up for criticism on a point not relevant to the badecon taking place here.

***

The first problem with the article's headline is the ""economists"" themselves.  When I saw the headline, I thought ""interesting.  Which economists?""  Anyone with this attitude is, by now, used to disappointment; the article cites only two people.  One is [Lawrence Yun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Yun), currently the National Association of Realtors chief economist, and the other is [William Foster](https://events.moodys.io/moodys-speakers/foster-william-en), vice president of Moody's Investor Service, a credit rating agency.

Yun's talking points, at least as stated in the article, revolve entirely around how student loans affect home ownership.  Surprise: higher student loans means lower home ownership.  He also states that homeowners have a much higher net worth than renters.  *Shocking.*

The idea that owning a home builds wealth is pretty common, but observe that Yun's statements in the article don't touch anything not related to home ownership.  It's to be expected - he is representing a realtor's organization, so of course his concern is home ownership - but this needs to be kept in mind when discussing the issue of student loan forgiveness.  More important than all this, however, is the following tidbit (emphasis mine):

> **He's not endorsing any particular plan**, but he estimates that broad loan forgiveness would push up the number of home sales quite a bit.

He didn't even endorse the plans being lauded by the commenters of the article.  Who knows what statements he made about the downsides of student loan forgiveness, since the article isn't talking about them.  Yun's non-endorsement is touched on in one subordinate clause, but his points about the upsides of loan forgiveness span multiple paragraphs.  I tried googling his name and ""student loan forgiveness"" to find what his position might be on it more specifically, but all I found was the exact same article posted to at least 5 different outlets, with literally no changes between them.

Foster's points in the article about student loan forgiveness have a much larger breadth; he discusses how forgiving student loans would result in a massive boost in GDP.  He also states that forgiving student loans would let college graduates buy homes, and that owning a home is ""the most powerful way for most working and middle class people to build wealth.""

First, I want to take a moment to appreciate a large bit of irony: when I found this article on /r/all, I found it at the number 2 spot with about 18 and a half thousand upvotes.  Right above it, with over 21 thousand, was [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/e1gtlk/everything_is_not_fine_nobel_economist_calls_on/) article, with the usual sensationalist ""we need to rework the entire global economy"" comments.  Both those articles have almost doubled in upvote count since I found them, read the article, took a shower, and started typing this R1.  Go ahead and let that one sink in.  GDP is useless, until its growth is associated with something I like, in which case now it's a good thing.  I'm sure ""Reddit is not one person"" is a natural reply a lot of people have, but honestly at this point it's obvious that many Redditors latch to ideas they like first and bring the reasoning later.

Foster's first point is almost a tautology.  Of course forgiving student loans would increase GDP.  Debt payments from students don't count as an increase in GDP, but most likely whatever they would spend it on otherwise would.  GDP is not a perfect measurement (as Joseph Stiglitz, an actual Nobel economist, said in the other aforementioned article), and maximizing it without regards to whether what is being done to maximize it is not productive or useful.  Even worse is maximizing short term GDP without regards to long term GDP.  If forgiving student debt increases consumer spending now, but the taxes levied to make up the difference results in an end reduction in investment, will the GDP stay unaffected?  His second point about housing is a pretty common idea, but it's still a narrow view of the issue.  But Foster's apprehensions about student loan forgiveness aren't listed until the very end of the article, where he talks about, you know, the huge downsides to student loan forgiveness.  I'll go over this more in a bit.

The biggest takeaway anyone reading this should have is that when an article says ""experts say X"", there is a huge leeway as to who the experts are, what their focus is, and what they're actually saying.  In this case, they referred to two economists with arguably biased interests/perspectives, selectively took claims and quotes from them, and used them to imply that those people were making a point they weren't.  What should be represented as ""these two guys with some good insight believe that X plan has Y upsides but Z downsides, so be cautious"" was instead interpreted by tens of thousands of Redditors as ""pretty much all the experts agree that X is a fantastic plan and only the bad guys in the world don't want it so they can keep twirling their evil mustaches"".  I'm not an economist, so I'm not claiming that Yun or Foster are committing bad econ; I'm reserving my criticism for the article's author, its publishers, and the Reddit commenters going all in on the headline.

***

Now I want to talk more about the general idea of student loan forgiveness and its downsides.  Where should I begin?

Student loans aren't particularly special in their regards to increase GDP; almost **any** loan forgiveness is going to increase GDP, as long as the money that would otherwise be spent on those loans is spent in areas that are measured by GDP (e.g. consumer spending).  Forgiving (or buying, then forgiving) credit card debt, mortgages, car loans, loans for medical bills, business loans, or literally any other form of debt would increase GDP.  That doesn't automatically make it a good thing.  What does make student loan debt different is the sort of person who has it: college graduates make much higher income than non-graduates.  I mean, I can give you [1](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2017/high-school-graduates-who-work-full-time-had-median-weekly-earnings-of-718-in-second-quarter.htm) [2](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/) [3](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/research-summaries/education-earnings.html) sources for this, but honestly why bother.  This is common knowledge; people who graduate from college make more than those who don't.  A wealth transfer towards some of America's highest earners is not really necessary; if you're so concerned with stopping the robber barons and billionaire class from exploiting the poor, why not cancel credit card debt instead?  People choose to go into debt to go to college as opposed to working right out of high school or going to trade school, but often times people in credit card debt were in unfortunate scenarios in life where they felt they had no other option.  Cancelling car loans would probably help millions of people who rely on it to get to their job, with some of those people living paycheck to paycheck.  It's quite likely that, if you're so concerned with increasing GDP, the people who would benefit from these earn less money, and these people have a higher [marginal propensity to consume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_propensity_to_consume).  College graduates with a sudden extra amount of income are more likely to invest it.  These sorts of investments, ironically, are painted as unproductive or even exploitative in the comment section of the article.

There are a number of potential replies to this, so I'd like to touch on them:

* *There aren't big downsides to student loan forgiveness.  Creditors are wealthy already, and don't need the money; college graduates do.*

 Student loans are a source of income for the government and are an asset owned.  [There is over $1.5 trillion of federal student debt](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=SLOAS,#0); if you were to forgive this whole amount in one go, you would greatly increase the deficit.  Even if the government can print money and levy taxes, it cannot do so without consequences: you can't ignore the deficit with the reasoning that ""it's the government, so it's OK"".  Is it different?  Certainly, but that doesn't mean you can just flat out not care.  If you're thinking that we should tax the rich to pay for it or that college should be free anyway, see the points below.

* *College should be free in the first place.*

 * Education does not grow on trees - it is expensive for a reason.  Educating someone is resource intensive.  If you make something like that free, the resource becomes over-utilized.  Imagine if the government paid everyone's gas bill.  You know what would happen?  Cars would pack the roads, we'd run out of gas, and ironically, people not well off enough to afford a car gain nothing from it.  Massive forgiveness of student loans encourage more people to take out student loans, and making college free encourages everyone to go, even if they don't need to or shouldn't.  Not everyone needs to be college educated.

 * Something being paid for by the government isn't free with no asterisks - it has to be paid for somehow.  The methods of paying for it would all require, in one form or another, much higher taxes, and while those taxes can be distributed in a number of ways, there isn't a way of doing it without negative consequences.  The question becomes whether the tax combined with free college is a net good or not.

 Observe that neither of these points is a rejection of the idea that the government should subsidize education, college or otherwise.  It's just stating the fact that it is not free, and trying to reduce the cost too far will result in over-utilization.

**EDIT**: I'm way late with this, but I should say this particular bullet point was not thought out well.  There are countries that have free higher education and make it work, so my implication that free college is economically bad was mistaken.  I will leave it unedited, though, as the main point wasn't so much about tuition-free college as about what ""free"" means and the potential consequences.  I apologize for this - especially the vague claim about ""over-utilization"" - but I think the point of this section, as well as the rest of the R1, still stands.


* *The super-wealthy should be taxed to pay for universal college.*

 Progressive tax rates are a pretty common idea, but like anything it can go overboard.  The richest Americans don't store their income in giant piles of cash that sit around and collect dust; they're stored in assets and investments.  If the wealthy are taxed too much, it reduces the investment made in the economy and consequently reduces job and economic opportunities - or alternatively, it leads to them simply moving abroad.  I understand that this sounds eerily similar to ""trickle down economics"", which is not what I'm advocating - higher income brackets should certainly have higher tax rates.  But that doesn't make them an infinite pile of cash just waiting to be taxed for whatever you'd like.  Budget plans still need to be grounded in reality.

***

The biggest irony in this whole situation is that the middle class and above are the ones who have to gain from this sort of policy, and not America's poorest.  Think about the sort of person saddled with car payments or credit card debt.  Some of them, naturally, might just be people who had money but made poor decisions.  However, a lot of those people are lower class workers who need their cars to go to work, or needed to go into debt to put food on the table.  Why not buy this debt from creditors and forgive that instead?  You could argue it would result in better off people taking advantage of it, but how couldn't this argument be given to the stereotypical liberal arts major, who got a degree before thinking about how they would pay for it?  At the end of the day, it's rent seeking, plain and simple.  It's a transfer of wealth from taxpayers to a specific group that already has higher income prospects.

Many of these people might justify themselves by proclaiming that they support a UBI or universal healthcare as well, but that just adds to the question as to how on Earth they intend to pay for those on top of this program.  Do you really think everyone richer than you is just a giant bag of money that can be mined through the government with no consequence?

I'd like to go through some of the comments on the article now, to see how this headline was discussed.  It's mostly just a repetition of the above ideas, strung together.  The [top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/e1fmtm/economists_say_forgiving_student_debt_would_boost/f8ord4m/):

> The middle class having more money means they will spend more money.  The super rich having more money means they will have a bigger balance in their savings account...

Again, they don't have giant savings accounts just sitting with gold coins to swim through.  They invest them, which are converted to job opportunities or economic enterprises.  Besides, you want more spending money in the economy, lower class Americans have a higher MPS - you should favor a program that benefits them and not college graduates.  The [top reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/e1fmtm/economists_say_forgiving_student_debt_would_boost/f8osis4/) to this comment is even worse:

> It’s really worse than that if you think about it.  Middle and lower income people will recirculate the money.  Rich people use the money to buy more of our collective resources and then profit off of them. It actually makes the problem worse every time we do this. They’re not “hoarding the money,” they’re hoarding what they buy with the money, which is the means of production.

This person is trying to conflate middle and lower income earners as much as possible.  Beyond this, wasn't one of the article's biggest arguments for debt forgiveness to promote home ownership?  You know, to build wealth over time?  What was that called again?  ""We don't want the super rich investing because it's just going to lead them to steal from our labor - *we* should be the investors instead.""  And if you genuinely believe that the concept of an investment as a whole is a scam that should be done away with by way of dismantling the entire economy and basing it on one that has failed every time it's been tried, I'm afraid the refutation of this is outside of the scope of this R1.

Here's another [broken window](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/e1fmtm/economists_say_forgiving_student_debt_would_boost/f8os04t/):

 I do notice a trend.  You'd use the money you now have to hire people for luxury services like cleaning and lawn mowing that might otherwise be hired by someone else instead.  But it's fine, because it's *you* who gets to have the nice things.

------------------------------

It's something awesome to live through one of the great bubbles of history. You get to see in real time some of the great speculative mania stories, like [people paying millions for something conferring no legal claim to anything][1] or the classic ""[yoga instructor selling her house to go all in on speculation][2]""

But what caused this cryptocurrency bubble? Today we're going to dive into a core driver, and likely **the largest Ponzi scheme in history**.

# What's Tether?

USDT is a ""stablecoin"" -- a cryptocurrency whose price is supposed to be pegged to the US dollar -- managed by a company called tether.

Initially tether said they enforced the peg by having each USDT be backed by a USD in a bank account. Then tether ran into all sorts of hilarious hijinks over the years, many of which we only found out because they [were made public in NYAG litigation][3], including:

*   Having all of tether's money in their lawyer's personal bank account (May 2017)

*   Not having any bank account anywhere in the world for 6 monthsto receive money in. Yet still emitting $400m new tethers in that period. Their lawyer's personal account had, at most, $60m at any point. Bitfinex had two institutional deposits in that whole period, neither of whom purchased USDT.

*   Failing to complete an audit and settling on an attestation (An audit verifies where money comes from. An attestation is just an accoutnant saying ""there was money in a bank account on that date"") for ""transparency"". The morning of the attestation, tether moved $380m from sister company bitfinex into a bank account the morning of the day of the attestation.

*   Losing $900M to their money launderer, and covering those losses by commingling bitfinex customer funds with tether reserve funds (2018)

*   Finding the last bank on earth, [Deltec Bank from Bahamas][4] willing to do business with them after Wells Fargo and HSBC fired them as clients. Remember HSBC has the kind of risk tolerance leaving them to [willingly deals with drug cartels][5]. No bank wants tether as a client.

Just read section 2 and 3 of the NYAG settlement. It's a blast. The best recap on the tether saga is by [Amy Castor][6], but [Patrick McKenzie][7] also has a good write up. Note that Patrick's piece is quaint now -- it was written back in 2019 when tether's balance sheet was $2B. Tether now has over [$58B on their balance sheet](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.28.53-PM-1024x585.png)

As far as we know, there was no point in history at which USDT in circulation were backed 1-to-1 by USD in a bank account. At this point, they stopped even pretending -- each tether in circulation is backed by... [tether's ""reserves"".][8]

# The ""Reserves""

For a long time, tether's ""reserves"" were a mystery. As found in the NYAG investigation, tether likely never had a dollar in a bank account for each USDT, at any point, ever. They're now forced to reveal the makeup in May 2021 as per the NYAG settlement. Tether found a 5-person accounting firm in the Cayman islands willing to do an [attestation][9], which states they have 0.36% more assets than liabilities.

In anticipation for their forced public disclosure, tether recently posted this [glorious pie chart](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/glorious_pie_chart-1024x769.png)

Which [has][11] [prompted][12] [many][13] [more][14] [questions][15]. First, we can view the actual debt in this form, as [broken Intel Jackal][16] ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/piechart.png))

Almost all of the reserves are in some form of loan to a commercial company (corporate bonds, commercial paper, secured loans). Only around 5% are in assets whose value we know (cash, T-Bills).

### Inconsistencies

Tether's general counsel, Stuart Hoegner, posted a [highly unusual blog post][17] in which he claims this is good debt by any standard. This raises many inconsistencies, which are easy to see given the magnitude of the numbers at hand.

*   Stuart claims they don't hold Treasury Bills because the interest rate is close to 0%. If they hold this risky debt as reserves because it pays higher interest, **why does tether only have 0.36% more assets than liabilities?** Either thether's management is looting the interest rates on the assets and leaving USDT holders with the debt's risk, or we're being lied to.

*   With $20B in commercial paper at the time of the attestation, and 50% more USDT on the market since, tether presumably has **$30B in commercial paper** at time of writing. The [entire commercial paper market][18] in the US is around $1T per year.

We're supposed to believe that **tether somehow holds 3% of the US commercial paper market** at time of writing, and that they *apparently bought 1% of the entire market in the last month alone*.

*   The asset allocation strategy in the reserves seems to be [copied from][19] an investment fund at tether's bank, Deltec. This investment fund apparently manages $425M, rather than $60B.

*   If the reserves are such regular financial assets, how come respectable accounting firms won't even touch it for a simple attestation?

We know that some of the money used for USDT come from Chinese money laundering because a tether shareholder [was recently charged][20]. But we see no mention of frozen accounts in the reserves. Moreover, this amounts to less than $0.5B, and the perpetrator was nicknamed the ""Chinese OTC King"" -- so even in the charitable case where USDT are fully backed by money laundering, this raises inconsistencies.

### Reminder: non-USD reserves for a stablecoin are a problem

As noted by [Frances Coppola][21], it's dangerous to guarantee to clients that something is worth $1 when your assets backing it are not dollars. The value of the USD changes very little. The value of crypto changes a lot.

If you want to enforce a market price of $1 for something backed by not-dollars, then the quantity of reserves needs to go up and down with the asset price changes. Otherwise, you'll eventually become insolvent, when asset prices become lower than what you bought them for.

# Who are these loan to?

Tether has lost the privilege of the benefit of doubt a long time ago. Here is how tether's Ponzi scheme likely works:

*   All their commercial debt is to the related exchanges (Binance, FTX, Bitfinex - see below) or their affiliated shell companies.

*   Tether make new USDT out of thin air and send them against a dollar-denominated loan to these affiliates

*   The affiliates use the new USDT to put market buy-orders for crypto, putting them on the new USDT on market

*   Crypto goes up in value becaue of the new demand pressure. This overcollateralizes the affiliated loans, justifying more loans.

*   Rinse, repeat.

We can track who new USDT go to directly by looking at their [TRON][22], [ethereum][23], [OMNI][24] and [Solana][25] blockchain addresses. By matching the blockchain addresses new USDT are sent to to known parties, we can track who are the ones sending [new USDT on the market:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether-to-exchanges-1024x530.png)

The counterparties are largely Binance, FTX, Bitfinex, and other exchanges. The commercial paper is presumably to affiliated shell companies. I wouldn't put those companies debt at a dollar-to-dollar valuation; for instance [Binance is currently under investigation by the DOJ and IRS][26].

# But how does the $1 peg hold?

This is an easy one. [FTX happily admits to enforcing the dollar peg][27] ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.12.17-PM-861x1024.png))

You can easily enforce the dollar peg by wash-trading around the $1 price and arbitraging on exchanges who don't.

FTX don't even need to be complicit to the scheme for this to make financial sense: if FTX can get new USDT for $1 on an infinite loan margin from tether, it's perfectly sensible to buy USDT when it's below $1 and shortsell USDT when it's above.

# The Mississippi bubble, 2021 style

The cryptocurrency ecosystem is conceptually simple. Money comes in from new investors buying, and the same money comes out to pay those cashing out. It would be a zero-sum ecosystem, except for the fact that miners have to pay their [bills in dollars](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_simple.png)

This is why ""bitcoin investors"" feel an immediate urge to tell everyone else to invest in bitcoin -- if no new money comes in, the financial structure eventually collapses under the miner's sell pressure.

Note how this is different than buying a company's stock. People buy and sell stocks on a stock exchange, but the companies independently have money coming in (from their clients). The stock of a profitable company is a positive-sum ecosystem. If somehow no one wants to buy the stock, a profitable company will be happy to buy it back itself.

When tether comes in with their scheme, they put demand pressure on BTC then add a supply constraint on BTC (also driving up the price!) by reducing the total supply of BTC to [hoard in their reserves](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_usdt.png)

Notice that even though bitcoin prices are higher, **no additional money entered the ecosystem** in the tether pump. Like a Ponzi scheme, we *cannot pay everyone off at the inflated price* using the pool of money that's in the crypto ecosystem (More specifically, the pool of money in the crypto exchange's customer fund bank accounts) When enough money starts looking for the exit door, a $60B hole gets torn into the ecosystem, and [someone has to pay for it.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/masterpiece.gif)

# The danger zone happens when BTC drops below $18,500

Assuming that each new USDT is used to instantly buy BTC at market prices (This is a lower bound estimate, since USDT are issued on the market between mint periods, where price is increasing), we can track where the BTC ""price of no return"" is -- where reserve BTC were paid for [more overall than they're now worth.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether_insolvency_point.png)

We can play around with parameters (they might buy ETH or Dogecoin rather than BTC, etc.) but most calculations land the death zone in the $17k-$20k range -- prices we were at around December 2020.

The scheme can easily collapse above this point. Bernie Madoff's customer deposits was around $18B against a $65B promised liabilities, but his scheme collapsed way before $40B in funds were withdrawn, because fraudsters tend to mismanage and embezzle some of the money for themselves.

Notice that the last point in time where BTC price went significantly below the death zone is the March 2020 COVID price crash -- which is also the point where USDT were started to be minted at a parabolic rate.

### The DeFi boom started with the USDT flood

This is a sidenote to this story, but the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) boom started because of USDT flooding the market. DeFi is not a new invention: it's existed since the 2017 bubble. No one picked it up because it's a fairly useless idea: lock up more collateral for a crypto loan than the loan's value and use the loan.

DeFi is exclusively used to leverage trading - eg. lock up BTC, keep the BTC exposure, and use the loan to buy more BTC. You can't buy a house or start a business on a DeFi loan -- the point of normal loans is to use personal creditworthiness and **under**collateralization to move future cashflows into the present. For these reasons, [no one picked it up for years](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.16.05-PM-1024x497.png)

But notice something happened around the same time as USDT exploded. We can track what happened to DeFi by getting historical borrowing rates and matching them to total money in DeFi (TVL), USDT in [DeFi and total USDT](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/defirates-1024x512.png)

A clear story emerges:

No one used DeFi until tether joined the Ethereum blockchain in April 2019. Then a ton of new tethers, with no particular place to go, found themselves emitting DeFi loans. This floored the borrowing rates for DeFi, especially so in April 2020, after tether started printing themselves out of insolvency.

Once borrowing rates were appealing, DeFi started taking off.

Eventually, the DeFi ecosystem tried to distance itself from USDT, but the coin is still around 45% of the entire space.

USDT DeFi loans are generally USDT-denominated. If the USDT peg breaks significantly, these USDT DeFi loans will go into margin call one way or another.

# The noose is tightening

At the time of writing, BTC crashed from a high of $64k to around $41k. But more importantly, for the first time in months, we're starting to see **significant backflows** into tether addresses, largely from Binance. Here are the outflows and inflows (excluding newly minted USDT) into the tether address [on Tron, for example](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/death-1024x567.png)

The orange lines are USDT coming out onto market. The blue lines are USDT coming back into tether's blockchain address.

This is means people are recently withdrawing, a lot. The music could stop at any moment now. It could take hours, or it could take months.

678,fsskb4,2020-04-01,badeconomics,Incel theory is internally inconsistent and can be disproven using reverse game theory,"#Introduction: 

I was talking to a friend of mine before econ class, and somehow the topic turned to [incels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incel). So we're talking about them, then he says these words:

""Incels are just dudes with no game.""

Writing it out mathematically, the statement becomes, ""If you are an incel, you are a dude with no game"", so the [contrapositive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraposition) implies that if you could somehow give ""game"" to an incel, the incel would cease to be an incel. But I wager that if even if you somehow found a large number of [Hitches](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386588/) to give them ""game"", it would be completely ineffective, as the incel mindset is, at its core, anti-woman. At the basis of the ideology is a fundamental objectification of women, simply turning them into objects of use, and hence an incel would likely use that ""game"" to commit harm against women.

So we can't use ""game"", but still, how can we help incels, or at least prevent other people from believing their ideology and becoming incels themselves?

*Teach all people reverse game theory, also known as mechanism design.* 

#Background: 

Immediately, the question is why teaching people mechanism design will help with the incel problem. This is because incel theory has a huge mechanism design flaw. 

See, according to incel theory, [women](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/ffel57/nature_has_not_destined_them_as_the_weaker_sex_to/) [constantly](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/e306om/they_are_lying_with_their_mouth_but_their_actions/) [lie](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/ennpri/she_lied_to_me_twice_she_said_ive_seen_many/) [to](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/f0k5qa/women_are_unconscious_liars_who_dont_even/) [men](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/au6rph/redditor_claims_that_all_women_lie_and_manipulate/), [putting](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/b7vp7d/they_often_lie_about_how_looks_attracts_them_to_a/) [on](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/bs5lwe/youre_lying/) [a](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/cto4qj/women_are_driven_to_rely_not_on_force_but_on/) [show](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/cvilte/women_cant_be_interesting_if_one_seems/) that they're good people, when they [actually](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/fh3htn/i_got_tired_of_lying_and_told_him_the_truth_he/) just want to use men for various things. If a man is ""trapped"" in a relationship with them, women reveal that they're actually hideous [beasts](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/c6ko96/caring_supporting_and_loving_women_dont_exist_and/) simply out to use and harm men.

That is bad economics, specifically bad mechanism design. Using the aforementioned assumptions, we will prove that incel theory is internally inconsistent.

#The Model: 

Let's create the setting. We have one lady, whom we will denote as W. There are N guys who are attracted to her, and want to become her boyfriend. She will only have one boyfriend. 

The key thing to note is that *each guy does not know how much he actually values a relationship a relationship with W*. This is because W may seem great in public, but in private and in a relationship she may be completely different. Maybe she's just putting on an act, like incel theory states.

So the guys don't know their exact values (V) of a relationship with W, but they have expected values (E(V)), which are dependent on a signal (S) they each receive about W. Maybe the signal is a rumor they heard about her, an Instagram post, whatnot.

We will assume that signals are positively correlated with values. In other words, a high/low signal means it's more likely that a guy's true value of a relationship with W will be high/low. Furthermore, we will assume that each guy's signals and values are ""affiliated"" with the others'. In other words, the higher other guys' signals/values are, the more likely you will have a high signal/value. We can say that in this model, values are interdependent and not independent. Furthermore, signals are drawn from the same distribution for each guy. Finally, every guy is risk-neutral.

Let's take the point of view of one guy who likes W, and there are N-1 other guys. We will let S denote the signal of this guy and Y_i denote the i-th highest signal of the other N-1 guys. So Y_1 is the highest signal of the others, Y_2 is the 2nd-highest, and so on, until Y_{N-1} is the N-1 highest of the others, i.e. the lowest.

Now let's use the incel assumptions to construct the mechanism that decides who becomes W's boyfriend. Accordingly, W is purely materialistic, shallow, and in general a bad person. She only cares about what the guys can do for her, be it buying her food, clothes, and whatnot. Hence, she will only enter a relationship with the guy who is willing to spend the most money on her (maybe there are other things she wants too, but if so let's just take the [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)) to combine those things into one value). This means that each guy will keep trying to do the others in terms of how much they spend on her (assuming that budget constraints do not bind). As each guy declares how much money he will spend on W, this ""raises the cost"" of a relationship with W. Eventually, there will come a point where the expected utility from being in a relationship with W will be negative; this occurs for a guy when the cost is too high. And so he drops out. More and more guys drop out, until there are only 2 guys left in this spending game. Finally, one of the guys will raise the cost just too high for the other guy, and so the other guy drops out, and thus the guy who raised the cost becomes W's boyfriend. The cost to W's boyfriend is thus the point at which the second-to-last guy dropped out.

You may notice that this mechanism sounds almost exactly like W setting up an [English auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_auction). And since this is an English auction, we know from [Vickrey (1961)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1961.tb02789.x) that this is equivalent to a [second-price sealed bid auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction) in equilibrium for independent private values; specifically, the equilibrium cost at which a winner wins is the same across both auctions. However, values here are interdependent, so equilibrium is not exactly the same. However, I will examine the second-price case, because the qualitative result is the same, and it's also easier. Just for robustness though, we'll discuss how the final qualitative result holds when analyzing the English auction perspective.

Now, return to the guy whose POV we are taking. Let [this](https://imgur.com/a/6ygJbiU) be his expected value of a relationship, condition on his signal equaling some $x$, and all the other guys' signals being whatever they are. 

However, remember the setting! If this guy wins, he pays the cost at which the last person among the others dropped out. Furthermore, signals and values are correlated, and due to the symmetry assumption from above, we have that the highest signal equals the highest expected value of a relationship. This means that our specific guy only cares about the signal of the person with the highest signal among the others, because the cost at which that guy drops out is the cost our guy pays. So we can rewrite the condition expected value [in this manner](https://imgur.com/a/N5Bir6i), for some signal y.

Finally, we will let b^*(x) denote the cost one pays if he becomes W's boyfriend, given that his signal is x. So in the second-price sealed bid auction setting, since we are assuming risk neutrality here, [expected utility is like so](https://imgur.com/a/T2GVIMR). Let's draw a graph!

[Cost is on the vertical axis, and the highest signal among the other guys is on the horizontal axis](https://imgur.com/a/YQgQi0J).

Let's suppose our guy shares that signal. Then his cost function will [look something like this](https://imgur.com/a/k3Cdq0K).

Next, we'll graph the expected value of a relationship, [fixing our guy's signal at some positive value x](https://imgur.com/a/IJ2jCgN). Notice that this doesn't start at 0, since one's own signal is positive, so even if others' signals are 0, one will have positive expected value. Right now we won't prove why the slope is less than that of the b function; we'll shiow that later. But the intuition, I think, is clear: your own signal has a higher effect on you than others' signals, and while your own signal is constant in the expected value function, it changes with y in the b function. So the b function has a greater slope.

Now, remember that all the guys are risk neutral, meaning our guy only wants to win when expected value is greater than or equal to cost, or lose when expected value is less than cost. [So we add these labels to our graph, for convenience](https://imgur.com/a/ioSvgBX).

[Now observe that b(y) is another way of writing one's expected value given that your signal, and the highest signal among the others, is y](https://imgur.com/a/PML5fOT). This shows that the slope of the b function is greater than that of the expected value function when S = x.

Anyways, because of the previous observation, [we can characterize the reservation cost, i.e. the cost at which one is indifferent between winning and losing, as b^*(x)](https://imgur.com/a/OUM9Srl).

[And this occurs when one's signal is x](https://imgur.com/a/3Xx3wzx). So, what is the ramification?

Well, because of everything we have shown in the graph's thus far, we can define b^*(x) in terms of condition expected value: [it is the expected value of a relationship, given that highest signal among the others is the same as yours](https://imgur.com/a/nD4NIrK). In other words, for each guy, it is an optimal strategy to act as though everyone else has the same signal as he does, so as to guarantee that he drops out when the cost goes too high, but stays in when it hasn't reached that point yet!

#Proving the Internal Inconsistency of Incel Theory: 

Supposedly, it is in W's interest to lie and hide her true nature from the guys. But does that actually hold, assuming [W is rational and intelligent in the Myersonian, game-theoretic sense](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeegamebe/v_3a3_3ay_3a1991_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a387-391.htm)?

Let's say that W will also get a signal about herself. She can commit to one of two plans: Plan A is to reveal the signal, and Plan B is to not reveal the signal. Remember, her goal is to extract the largest cost out of the guys as possible. So given this objective, which plan is optimal?

Well, let's define new variables. Let X_i define the i-th highest signal overall. So for example, if we take the perspective of the guy with the highest signal, then his signal is X_1, but Y_1 is the next-highest signal, i.e. Y_1 = X_2 in this case.

Let us also define S_W to be the signal that W can choose to revealing or not revealing. Suppose that S_W = w. Then if she chooses to reveal it, a guy with signal x will act according to the above, while also taking into account W's signal, [in this manner](https://imgur.com/a/PHXHKsh).

Incel theory dictates that W's optimal strategy is to commit to not reveal her signal. Now, you may know of the [Linkage Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_principle), as proven by [Milgrom and Weber (1982)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1911865?origin=crossref&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents), which will tell you whether or not incel theory is correct. But we will do a direct proof here. spoiler: incel theory is wrong, and it is actually W's optimal strategy to commit to revealing her signal.

Now we know that W's benefit comes from the cost at which the guy with the second-highest signal drops out. So let us take the perspective of the guy with the second-highest signal.

[We begin with the identity between cost and expected value that was proved earlier](https://imgur.com/a/NYFtIIf).

Next, we will use the [Law of Iterated Expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_expectation). Using the LIE, we get [this next line here](https://imgur.com/a/1aHdcH5).

Next, since the outside conditions have your signal and the highest among the others equal to x, [we will fix those conditions for the inside as well](https://imgur.com/a/qmYEtt8).

[This next line follows from the identity between the b function and conditional expected value](https://imgur.com/a/ypFD6q0).

Next, we know that we are looking from the perspective of the person with the second-highest signal, [and as such S = X_2](https://imgur.com/a/KV50rDN).

Now we shake things up. Suppose that the highest signal of the others is greater than or equal to x. Since all the guys' signals and values are affiliated, it means that now, [the expected cost is greater than or equal to what it was before](https://imgur.com/a/Du12V8g).

Next, [we can simplify the expression like so](https://imgur.com/a/lJiN70F), since S = X_2 = x already implies that the highest signal among the others' is greater than or equal to x.

Finally, we know we're looking at the guy with the second-highest signal, so [we can get rid of the S](https://imgur.com/a/Lo65LNw).

What did we just prove? Remember that the cost W gets from her boyfriend is the cost at which the guy with the second-highest signal dropped out, i.e. his reservation cost. Hence, this proof shows that the reservation cost of the guy with the second-highest signal [is less than or equal to his expected reservation cost, given that W chose to reveal S_W](https://imgur.com/a/qAbLOxL)! QED.

**In other words, it is optimal for W to commit to revealing her signal, which proves that incel theory is internally inconsistent with its assumptions!**

#Discussion: 

The intuition is that the second-highest reservation cost underestimates the true value to that guy of a relationship with W, since the guy with the second-highest signal operates under the assumption that the highest signal among the others equals his. This is false, though, as the highest of the other signals is greater than his, and if he knew that, then his expected value would increase. Hence, by committing to revealing S_W, W corrects for this underestimate and raises, on average, the second-highest reservation cost. This is because her signal is affiliated with the highest other signal.

Now let's loop back to the English perspective. Using the Linkage Principle, it can be proved that English case has an expected cost greater than or equal to the second-price case. Furthermore, W revealing her signal yields the same qualitative result: this is more beneficial to her than hiding her signal.

Hence, teaching people mechanism design will showcase this internal inconsistency in incel theory.

***- The Red Book of Westmarch***

[https://imgur.com/a/Hqeqe3O](https://imgur.com/a/Hqeqe3O)

Confession time. I have never read Lord of the Rings. I’ve tried. It’s boring as hell. I simply cannot bring myself to care about the various Hobbits, Bobbits, Vishtarwë the Maleficents, Gandalf the Eggshell Off-White’s and so on. 

I like fantasy books, I really do! I even adore the Hobbit, but LOTR just utterly fails to capture my interest with its overly detailed lore, meandering exposition, and total disjointedness from the Hobbit. Seriously, imagine if 20 years later the authors of Winnie the Pooh came back with a trilogy of books about how Piglet and Rooh were dragged into a world-ending contest of good versus evil that gave them PTSD and then they got on a boat to heaven-America with a bunch of heffalumps. That’s how LOTR feels to me. 

There’s also one other question that bothers me:

*When Gandalf is imprisoned on the pinnacle of Orthanc, why doesn’t he just pull out his Remington 870 pump action shotgun and just start unloading into the Oruk-Hai?* 

“What a stupid question,” you say, “This is just a work of fiction, it doesn’t need to conform to your standards of ‘realism’ and, even if it did, it’s set during the equivalent of the middle ages, of course they don’t have guns.” Well, smart ass, first of all everything absolutely does have to conform to my unnecessary standards, you philistine. Second, you *would* think it’s the middle ages, but human society has actually been around in Middle Earth about as long as it has in ours.^(1) Weird right?

And so I present: *an investigation into the most minute details of the world-building of The Lord of the Rings, by someone who’s never finished the books (but has seen the extended edition movies!) and is really just using it as a way to externally motivate himself to do some reading.*

But first, let me be specific. My question isn’t just why Gandalf doesn’t own any sort of firearm. Any pansy from like \~1200 A.D. onwards could get their hand on a tube that shoots out some metal bits.^(2) I want to know why Gandalf, wielder of some of the most elite weaponry in Middle Earth, doesn’t own a top of the line 5.56mm M16A2 with an adjustable stock.^(3) I want to know why Gandalf, premier purveyor of magical explosives, hasn’t got his hands on an FGM-148 Javelin Missile Anti-Tank Weapons System.^(4)

[https://imgur.com/a/ly1ny59](https://imgur.com/a/ly1ny59)

In other words, why hasn’t Middle Earth had an *industrial revolution,* where technology and the economy have advanced to a point where Gandalf can get his hands on the sort of weapons that would make Sting and Glamdring look like expensive box cutters? 

Like I touched on before, from the dawn of the second age to the point that Gandalf is seized in Orthanc there was a 6459 year gap. From the dawn of Elven civilization (which seems to have begun at a much higher level of technology than our world did) during the first age to his imprisonment ,something like 11,000 years have passed.^(5) For comparison, both Sumerian Mesopotamia and Egyptian civilization developed approximately 6,000 years ago.^(6) ^(7) And even that second number of >11,000 years is being generous to Tolkien! If you really wanted to stack the deck against him, some form of intelligent organized civilization that is invested in discovery and creation has been on Middle Earth for over 45,000 years. 

Obviously, it’s not the case that all configurations of the world teleologically approach industrialization, but this much time having passed suggests that it’s not just that Middle Earth is at an earlier point on the same path to development that we were on, but rather that something is fundamentally different about their technological and economic progress.

This leaves open two possibilities: 1. Tolkein is a bad world builder and vastly overrated or 2. There are different structural conditions and historically contingent factors that put Middle Earth on a very different path of economic development from our world such that the Industrial Revolution wouldn’t have occurred. 

My plan for these posts is to go step by step and look at various theories for the cause of industrialization with two questions in mind. First, is the theory actually a good or reasonable explanation for why the Industrial Revolution happened and, second, are conditions such in Middle Earth that we would expect to see similar outcomes. 

But, first:

**II.  Preempting the pedants, did the Industrial Revolution even happen?**

>*He bitterly regretted his foolishness, and reproached himself for weakness of will; for he now perceived that in \[disagreeing with the premise of this post\] he obeyed not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies.*  
**-The Red Book of Westmarch**

“But wait!” you say, in that nasally voice reserved for someone who thinks they are about to make a very clever point. “Aren’t you presuming that there is such a discrete entity as the Industrial Revolution? I think you’ll find that there is widespread academic disagreement about what and when the Industrial Revolution was.” 

First, I’m sorry you didn’t get invited to parties in college.

Second, yes I think it’s broadly correct to dispute that there is a clear demarcation of what the Industrial Revolution was and even if it actually happened. 

The sort of model of the IR that we get taught in high school goes something like. “Life sucked, then the steam engine was invented, this let us make a lot of things. Life doesn’t suck now.” For high schoolers, that’s probably a reasonable way of explaining it, but it is definitely over simplifying. 

There’s very reasonable disagreement about the initial impact of changes in manufacturing technology on living standards, overall economic output, etc.^(8 9) It’s also right to point out that Britain may have been experiencing (low levels of) sustained growth prior to what is classically demarcated as the Industrial Revolution.^(10 11) Furthermore, it neglects other changes in other parts of the economy such as massive improvements in agriculture, trade, and government policy. Yet, I don’t think that means we can’t talk about the Industrial Revolution.

Even if we accept that there is a lot of ambiguity about specifics, we might broadly think of the Industrial Revolution as what happened here^(12): [https://imgur.com/a/iKtFoSm](https://imgur.com/a/iKtFoSm)

Like I said, that’s a lot of things! The 18th and 19th century saw improvements in agriculture, technology, trade, political policies etc. As the critique above pointed out, these may historically embedded changes that were dependent on prior developments in earlier time periods, but they were still large changes nonetheless.

And as much as the IR that I am describing was a collection of many things affecting each other in a network of causality, it’s also just one thing: the takeoff of sustained exponential economic growth. To that end, the latter broader understanding of the IR is what I mean when I say “Industrial Revolution” in the rest of this post. As to what caused what, I’m going to remain generally agnostic, as that will vary from theory to theory that I’ll examine. So, to put the puzzle yet another way: did Middle Earth have the right conditions to achieve the takeoff of sustained economic growth (sufficient for Gandalf to own a technical)? [https://imgur.com/a/rSaKP9Z](https://imgur.com/a/rSaKP9Z)

**III. Raw Materials**

>*You asked me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and I chose Mr. Baggins. Just let any one say I chose the wrong man or the wrong house, and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you like, or go back to digging coal.""*  
**- Gandalf the Grey**

The first place a defender of Tolkien is likely to protest his innocence of the crime of unrealistic worldbuilding is to say that Middle Earth simply didn’t have the right raw materials and resources to experience an Industrial Revolution. 

As theories of the industrial revolution go, this is pretty basic. The argument, put simpliciter, is that certain materials and resources are necessary for industrialization and without them historical industrialization couldn’t have happened. 

The best case for a single necessary material is probably coal. Coal is incredibly energy dense at 24 megajoules per Kg, making it extraordinarily useful for powering industrial machines.^(13) Indeed, basically all steam engine models used it for power. That coal is a necessary condition for industrialization is, as I understand it, one of Kenneth Pomeranz’s main claims in *The Great Divergence**^(14)**.* A slightly more recent version of the claim is made by E.A. Wrigley^(15):

>The possibility of bringing about an industrial revolution depended on gaining access to a different source of energy. Mining coal provided the solution to this problem. It enabled societies to escape from what Jevons termed ‘the laborious poverty of early times’.

So, have we solved why Middle Earth hasn’t industrialized? Is it just that they don’t have coal? Well, there are a couple issues.

First, Middle Earth actually has coal! Something I was kinda surprised to discover. As mentioned in the quote introing this section, the Dwarves are explicitly described as mining coal in The Hobbit. There’s no direct evidence that anyone else mines it, but I think it can probably be inferred that other races and kingdoms that have mines or quarries have come across it (Orcs, Hobbits, Humans, and some elf clans). Furthermore, we know that at least some Dwarves are forced to engage in trade with other places (because they don’t produce their own food) and so other races probably could get their hands on coal indirectly^(16). 

The existence of coal raises a a secondary question. Coal, as you know, is the compacted flesh of ancient entities from days long gone by unearthed to power dark and terrible rituals but at unimaginable and unforeseen cost. Or, to put it another way, coal is the product of prehistoric biomass used to power steam engines that did a bit of an oopsie on the climate.^(17)

But uh, *prehistoric biomass,* raises a bit of an issue. We have the entire history of Middle Earth written down and I… didn’t notice the part where Tolkien mentioned dinosaurs?^(18)  More problematically, coal apparently takes millions of years to form, which is, roughly 900,000 years longer than Middle Earth has been around?^(19)

I think there are a few ways to square this circle. First, coal exists, but that doesn’t mean coal comes into being the same way in Middle Earth. For all we know, coal pops into existence whenever a Balrog dies. There is no indication that the same process applies. Second, maybe dinosaurs (and therefore likely prehistoric plants) did exist?

Tolkien tells us of the mounts of the Nazgul that:

>*The great shadow descended like a falling cloud. And behold! it was a winged creature: if bird, then greater than all other birds, and it was naked, and neither quill nor feather did it bear, and its vast pinions were as webs of hide between horned fingers; and it stank.* ***A creature of an older world maybe it was, whose kind, fingering in forgotten mountains cold beneath the Moon, outstayed their day, and in hideous eyrie bred this last untimely brood, apt to evil. And the Dark Lord took it, and nursed it with fell meats, until it grew beyond the measure of all other things that fly; and he gave it to his servant to be his steed.****Down, down it came, and then, folding its fingered webs, it gave a croaking cry, and settled upon the body of Snowmane, digging in its claws, stooping its long naked neck.*  
*The Lord of the Rings - Book V, Chapter 6 - ""The Battle of the Pelennor Fields""*

He confirmed in a later letter that:

>*“Pterodactyl. Yes and no. I did not intend the steed of the Witch-King to be what is now called a 'pterodactyl', and often is drawn (with rather less shadowy evidence than lies behind many monsters of the new and fascinating semi-scientific mythology of the 'Prehistoric'). But obviously it is pterodactylic and owes much to the new mythology, and its description even provides a sort of way in which it could be a last survivor of older geological eras.”*  
(*The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien*: Letter 211 To Rhona Beare.)

So, maybe Middle earth did actually have a prehistoric era in which peet could have slowly condensed and formed into coal.^(20)

Finally, I think we may have recourse to simply stipulate that Middle Earth has coal and any other natural resource that the actual industrial revolution had. Middle Earth is framed, explicitly, as an account of the history of *our* world. That is, the world of the Lord of the Rings is one and the same as our world, just at a very different point in its history. Thus, while Middle Earth may possess resources that we do not, such as Mithril, unless the resources of our world were deposited later, they must have been available to the people of Middle Earth. 

So, Middle Earth had coal, but did it *need* coal? I don’t think so. Remember, the reason we said coal was a necessary condition for industrialization was that it could be considered a unique source of energy that could power machines that, under some interpretations, were the beginning of the IR. This can be decomposed into two questions. First, is coal necessary as an energy source for the set of machines we are interested in? Second, is that set of machines necessary for the industrial revolution?

Clarks and Jack (2007) look at both of these questions around coal and the IR and make several findings that are relevant to us.^(21) First, they look at the historical evidence and suggest that the main area where the IR gave us productivity gains was actually in textile production, which has relatively low energy costs. That is, while the steam engine, the coal guzzling invention that it was, was the poster child of the industrial revolution, the action, at least early on, was in the Spinning Jenny: [https://imgur.com/a/GXswfEJ](https://imgur.com/a/GXswfEJ)

The Spinning Jenny and its ilk were machines that greatly enhanced the productivity of laborers making fabrics and clothing, by augmenting the laborers ability to manipulate fabrics. These were complicated machines no doubt, but not machines that relied a great deal on external energy as an input. These machines, according to the data set Clark and Jacks use, were actually what drove a lot of the initial economic change in Britain in the early years of the IR. So, at least initially, coal may not have been required to get the IR off of the ground.^(22)

The second finding that Clark and Jacks make that I think is relevant is the relative cost of coal compared to other sources of energy. While coal was certainly cheaper and easier than burning wood or constructing a water wheel, the latter were available options. Clark and Jacks put their estimate of what the costs of using this more inefficient energy sources would have been to Britain at around 6% of GDP. Expensive to switch? Absolutely. Impossible? I don’t think so. Therefore, even if you don’t buy any of my explanation about coal being present in Middle Earth, it may not have been necessary.

Lastly, this idea of using non-coal based sources of course raises further questions about the availability of wood supplies and sources of water power in Middle Earth(some of which I address in the next section), but I think the general point has been made that there doesn’t seem to be any resource that is A. Totally unavailable on Middle Earth and B. An absolutely necessary component for historical industrialization. So, the reason Middle Earth hasn’t industrialized is not because some resource is entirely missing.

**IV. Factor Prices**

>*After that we went away, and we have had to earn our livings as best we could up and down the lands, often enough sinking as low as blacksmith-work or even coalmining. But we have never forgotten our stolen treasure. And even now, when I will allow we have a good bit laid by and are not so badly off…we still mean to get it back, and to bring our curses home to Smaug if we can.*  
**- King Under The Mountain, Thorin II “Oakenshield”**

The natural next theory to examine after looking at binary Yes/No facts about the presence of resources is a theory about the relative abundance and price of resources. Specifically, I think it’s worth examining Robert Allen’s “Relative Factor Prices” explanation of the Industrial Revolution.^(23)

To do that, we need to talk about something which I have, perhaps surprisingly, not really discussed thus far: invention*.* It’s common, at least when thinking historically, to run together the ideas of *science* (discovering some facts about the world) and the ideas of *invention* (creating a novel machine or device). They seem to conjure up the same image of a lone genius toiling away to advance the frontier of human knowledge and achievement. There is some evidence that we should think this conflation is erroneous (More to come on the contribution of science to the IR in the next post). 

First of all, the technological wonders of the industrial revolution, the Spinning Jenny, the Steam Engine, etc, did obviously require knowledge of certain facts about the physical world (for instance, certain facts about the nature of a vacuum are necessary for a steam engine), but it wasn’t like the factor preventing their invention was lack of knowledge. Indeed, while these machines came around in the late 18th to early 19th century, Allen argues that the scientific discoveries necessary for their creation were made before 1700.^(24) That is, the discovery of facts necessary for inventing machinery and the actual invention of that machinery were largely separate distinct events. 

So, if it’s not just knowledge of the facts that underpin the machine, what else is necessary for invention? Under Allen’s explanation: profit motive. Inventions such as the steam engine took teams of people years to complete, they weren’t the sort of thing that could be made by a hobbyist in their backyard.^(25) To make a modern comparison, we don’t think of the newest iphone as the sort of thing that could be made and brought to market by a lone individual. Similarly, the inventions of the Industrial Revolution were worked on by teams of inventors and financiers mainly out of the hope of profit. Both Newcomen and Watt, the inventors of both major types of steam engine, were motivated explicitly by profit and received venture capital investment in exchange for future profits.^(26) These R&D processes took years and required the persistent hope of economic returns at the end.

So, what determines if investment in an invention will be profitable: *factor prices.* 

Think of it like this. For any given amount of textiles, I could either employ a lot of labor to make them or I could invest capital into making a machine that will allow me to replace a fair amount of that labor with the use of coal and machines. Whether that is worth it or not depends mostly on two things: the price of coal and the price of labor.

That coal’s price was low and labor's price was high in Britain is basically Allen’s account of why the IR happened there and not anywhere else.^(27)

[https://imgur.com/a/A1OO4UU](https://imgur.com/a/A1OO4UU)

Given the data above: a plausible explanation about why Britain was willing to spend the time and money inventing machines seems to emerge. But, before we get to evaluating whether Middle Earth has the right factor prices for industrialization, it’s asking the other question I suggested was relevant: is this actually a good theory of why the industrial revolution happened?

I dunno, maybe? 

There are a couple of ways that we can push back on the “high wage, low coal cost” thesis. First, there’s some dispute as to whether British laborers were actually earning higher wages than their continental equivalent.^(28 29) I’m not really equipped to weigh in on the detailed parsing of historical documents going on here, some I’m just going to leave it at “Smart people disagree”.

A second way to push back is to point out that the cost of paying a workers daily wage is not the same thing as the cost of *labor.* What do I mean by this? Well, British wages may have reflected the fact that the average worker in Britain was more productive than a worker on the continent. So, it’s not that *labor* thought of as something like dollar price to have something done was more expensive, it’s more like, fewer people needed to be hired to do the same work, so each of them earned more. 

A point like this is made by Kelly, Moky, and O’Grada (2014) who look at various sources of contemporaneous commentary on the relative efficacy of British and French labor.^(30) French labor is consistently described as being lower quality and less effective than British labor, providing some evidence for the idea that higher wages reflected higher efficiency levels. They also find some empirical evidence of this by looking at heights of workers (as height is correlated with worker efficiency) and finding that the British were taller on average than French workers.^(31)

So, factor prices don’t seem to be a perfect explanation. That said, I don’t think the evidence against it *definitively* busts the idea, so it’s worth taking a look at how Middle Earth stacks up.

To recap, the incentive to industrialize (under Allen’s theory) is determined by the following equation:

[https://imgur.com/a/50Uq1X7](https://imgur.com/a/50Uq1X7)

As this ratio goes down, it becomes less and less profitable to invent industrial machines.

**IV.A Labor Supply of Middle Earth**

First, let’s try and estimate the labor supply of Middle Earth. In other words, we need to get at least a rough estimate of the population.^(32)

Now, as he is want to do, Tolkien says very little about this. So, we need to try and estimate it somehow. Importantly, I don’t think the normal methodology people seem to use to estimate fantastical population will work here. Often times what I see people do is grab a similar seeming historical example where we have the population numbers and then suggest that because they share some underlying characteristics (usually geographically), the population will be at least around the same magnitude. This doesn’t really work as an approach in this instance. We are explicitly trying to compare Middle Earth to our world, if we just substitute in real world values of course we are going to conclude that they are the same!

I don’t think we are at an absolute dead end here. Instead, what we need to do is find some general rule about the relationship of a population to some other variable of interest that Tolkien *does* mention and work backwards. An interesting attempt at this sort of manuever has been made using the size of armies. There is (apparently, this isn’t really my area at all) a pretty solid and consistent relationship between the size of armies and the size of the population that fields them in feudal settings. The logic operating here is that for each and every troop in the field, a certain amount of additional members of support are necessary. Therefore, the ratio of troops/civilians seemed to stay relatively constant across population size. 

Here is a set of (very, very, very, very rough) estimates people have made using this sort of process^(33 34):

Rohan: 400,000-600,000

Gondor: 1.6-2.6 million

The Shire: 60,000-140,000

For comparison, the population of Britain was about 6.5 million in 1680, just before the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.^(35) Now obviously these locations are all of different geographic size, so we need to convert our numbers into people/miles. This gives us the following (Using the middle value of the ranges)^(36):

England in 1680: \~129 people per square mile

Rohan: \~12 people per square mile

Gondor: \~24 people per square mile

The Shire: \~6 people per square mile.

That’s much lower! This suggests that, at least prima facie, labor should be much more expensive in Middle Earth.

**IV.B Labor Productivity**

Now, if we remember back to one of the objections to the *factor-price* explanation, the cost of labor isn’t just determined by the quantity of the population, but is also set by the quality of the population. This is where we run into problems with a real lack of evidence. I tried to make a similar analysis to what Kelly, Mokyr, and O’Grada did regarding height information, but I think this runs into issues.

As I see it there are really two problems preventing us from drawing conclusions about the relationship of height to productivity when looking at Middle Earth. First, almost every single person whose height we are told in Middle Earth is of wealthy birth. This significantly skews our sample as nobility and high born are going to have access to many more calories at an early age, allowing for development and growth rather than stunting. And this leads into our second problem, which is that the relationship between height and labor productivity is complicated and will vary across data sets. 

I think the easiest way to explain this point is to really dig into what height is telling us about labor productivity. Simplifying somewhat, height of a peasant can tell us two things about how productive their labor was: *physically* how productive they were and *mentally* how productive they were. The first, physical difference, is pretty self explanatory. The taller and bigger you are, the better you are going to be at moving stuff around. Graphically, something like this: [https://imgur.com/a/Symt4bX](https://imgur.com/a/Symt4bX)

The second relationship is a little more complicated. Height is, in part, determined by whether you were developmentally stunted. That is, if you received enough calories as a child. Stunting also has a mental component, where malnourishment results in lower cognitive ability. Importantly, malnourishment as a determinant of height and cognitive ability is *bounded.* That is, receiving fewer calories as a child will decrease your height and cognitive ability, but increasing them past what is nutritionally needed will not increase your intelligence or height. This means that past a certain threshold, height is not indicative of cognitive ability. 

In other words, low height levels had an additional factor affecting labor productivity that high height levels did not. Isolating just the *mental* component, we might think it looks something like this graphically: [https://imgur.com/a/FML8L7d](https://imgur.com/a/FML8L7d)

If we combine these two together, we get a relationship between height and productivity like this:

[https://imgur.com/a/k5g77ZT](https://imgur.com/a/k5g77ZT)

Okay, so what’s the problem here? Think of it like this, that one peasant was much taller than another was probably a fairly good indicator of their being higher productivity, it was picking up on both physical and mental differences. That someone in Denmark (the tallest country in the world) is taller than someone in Japan (a relatively short country where that likely isn’t from malnutrition) is probably not as good a predictor of productivity, it might tell us that the Dane will be slightly more physically productive but it certainly isn’t telling us anything about *mental ability* or whether the Japanese person was malnourished. The problem here is that we are picking from two different populations with two different natural height rates (i.e. assuming perfect nutrition in both cases, they would have had different levels of height anyway). Fundamentally, we are dealing with two different relationships between height and productivity. Think of this as the **X** nutrition point in the height graph being located in a different spot for the different populations. That a hobbit is at a height that suggests severe malnutrition for a human gives us no information about whether they were malnourished

So, we can’t just use variation from modern day height to gauge malnutrition, *because we don’t know which heights give us evidence of malnutrition.* The labor force is composed of a variety of *species* each with its own physical traits and baselines that we would need to adjust for, and for which we have no data. Okay, you say, but couldn’t we just do an apples to apples comparison of humans to humans and just drop the dwarves and elves and whatnot? Unfortunately, I don’t think so. The problem here is that I don’t think Tolkien’s humans are biologically the same as us. Here are some of the heights we get for humans in the LOTR (again, acknowledging these are unrepresentative nobles).^(37)

Aragorn: *6 foot 6 inches*

Boromir: *6 foot 6 inches*

Faramir: *Tall, probably the same as Boromir*

They are all freakishly tall! Why is this? Partly perhaps because we are selecting on the dependent variables and freakishly tall people are more want to become combat-focused adventurers. Partly, because a lot of these people aren’t actually 100% “Human”. That is, a lot of them are partially descended from elves.^(38) The introduction of possible elf “genes” into the population of humans (Genes, I guess, is the right way of putting it? Do elves have genes? Do they have DNA?) into our analysis means that we don’t know how many calories are needed to avoid malnuitrition, making it near impossible to estimate height’s relationship with productivity. 

If I had to guess, and I mean this is an absolute spitball, the average worker in Middle Earth is slightly more productive than a historical British Peasant? I don’t really have any proof of this, but it just sort of intuitively feels correct? Like, I have a hard time imagine the introduction of elven heritage makes you *worse* at being a farmer and I think there’s a non-zero chance it makes you better at least if these heights are anything to go by.

**IV.C Coal Prices**

Finally, how do coal prices compare to industrializing Britain? Well, it’s hard to know for certain, but I think they were likely higher. 

Coal isn’t mentioned a great deal in the books, mostly as backstory for the dwarves in The Hobbit or as a description e.g. “Coal-black eyes”. I think we can infer a few things about coal production. One, Dwarves seem to be highly valued for their ability to produce coal. If there is a Dwarven monopoly on coal mining this is probably going to raise prices as A. they will be able to upcharge customers and B. They seem to really detest coal mining, so probably would need high pay to do so. 

However, I don’t want to treat the fact that only Dwarves are mentioned as mining coal as definitive evidence of coals scarcity in Middle Earth, after all, absence of evidence =/= evidence of absence. 

So, what other means do we have to estimate the availability of coal in Middle Earth? Well, it turns out Tolkien made a fair amount of illustrations of Middle Earth^(39)

[https://imgur.com/a/BEBnxmr](https://imgur.com/a/BEBnxmr)

Now, if you look at the above picture, do you see anything missing? 

**Chimneys.** I went through every sketch of his I could find and this is one of the only of Tolkien’s sketches with chimneys on the buildings, and they are still relatively infrequent. Importantly, I think they are also the wrong type of chimney. 

When London made the switch from using wood to using coal for indoor heating, this required the development of a different type of chimney or coal-smoke would fill the home. As Allen (2009) puts it^(40): 

>An enclosed fire place or metal chamber was necessary to confine the coal for high temperature combustion. The coal had to sit on a grate so a draft could pass through. A tall, narrow chimney (rather than the wide chimney used with wood fires) was needed to induce a draft through the burning coal.

These do not look like narrow chimneys to me. I think both the relative infrequency of chimneys and the fact that the ones we do see are more broad and square rather than tapered in is indicative of lower rates of coal usage for heating in Middle Earth. In contrast, in London before the IR the use of coal as a heat source was ubiquitous as a function of it’s widespread availability and low cost.^(41)

Thus, on the basis of some Pepe Silvia-level staring at sketches of houses, I’m going to rule the prevalence of coal in Middle Earth as likely lower than that of 17th century England. 

What about alternative energy sources? Maybe Middle Earth had very cheap water power or wood supply? I couldn’t find any great evidence regarding the number of rivers, so I’m going to assume that remains roughly equivalent. As for wood, we, uh, pretty explicitly get evidence that if you start chopping down tree’s that’s going to end fairly poorly for you:

>*We go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door; For bole and bough are burning now, the furnace roars – we go to war!*  
*To land of gloom with tramp of doom, with roll of drum, wecome, we come;*  
**- The Ents, shortly before ruining Saruman’s day**

So, I’m going to suggest that wood is looking even worse than coal as an industrial fuel source.

**IV.D. Summary**

So, where does that put the potential profitability of industrialization in Middle Earth relative to our world? It’s ambiguous, without some estimate of the effect size, we can’t know if the lower (and therefore more expensive) supply of labor is outweighed by the much higher price of coal. Additionally, it’s hard to know how much more productive elf blood would have made laborers. In general, I would guess that the coal side of things outweighs the more expensive labor (partly because I imagine labor markets aren’t that well functioning in Middle Earth), but I don’t want to make a definitive statement.

**V. Conclusion of Part I**

So, we’ve looked at the availability of various resources in Middle Earth and found that Middle Earth definitely had at least some of the things that we think are necessary, but that it’s ambiguous if it had the right arrangement of prices to make industrialization profitable. Overall, I’m going to call this one a draw between me and Tolkien. After all, I haven’t proven he is bad at worldbuilding, but it’s not like he’s proven he’s *good* at it. So who can really say which view is right.

Make sure to tune in next time where I take a swing at Tolkien over science and human capital in Middle Earth by asking the question: Hobbits, do they know things? What do they know? Let’s find out.

680,vij9oq,2022-06-23,badeconomics,Joe Biden's Proposed Gas Tax Suspension is Bad Economics,"President Biden has [recently called on Congress to suspend the Federal Gas Tax](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-congress-gas-tax-holiday-3-months) of 18 cents until September. This move comes as the United States -- and many parts of the rest of the world -- have seen dramatic spikes in gas prices, driven in large part by energy shortages resulting from the war in Ukraine and subsequent Russian sanctions.

So is a suspension of the gas tax a good way to get relief to drivers? The stupid R1 is that the US gas tax is tiny; 18 cents is minuscule when gas is over $5 a gallon so this policy can't do much good or bad. But suppose the US had a meaningful gas tax, would suspending the tax to give drivers relief be sound economic policy? Absolutely not. 

First, we have little reason the believe that a suspension of the gas tax would lead to meaningfully lower prices. This is because the statutory incidence of a tax cut is not necessarily the same as the economic incidence. In this case, just because you suspended a tax on gasoline at the pump, that doesn't mean that consumers will be the ones who benefit. Those eighteen cents of relief will be split between consumers and producers based on the relative elasticities of supply and demand. In the case of a tax cut, the more relatively inelastic supply is, the more producers will benefit, and the more relatively inelastic demand is the more producers will benefit. For traditionalists, [here is a shitty MS Paint graph of what's going on](https://imgur.com/a/vvnMMHW). For others, the intuition here is that 

1.  In the short term, [supply is constrained](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/global-refiners-falter-efforts-keep-up-with-demand-2022-05-31/) and demand for gas is [relatively elastic](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2020/0616) 
2. Because demand is somewhat elastic, a lowering of the gas tax causes people to want to consume more gas
3. But supply is constrained so this movement along the demand curve just leads to prices going up without much supply increase.
4. This means that it's likely that most of the benefit of a gas tax will be captured by producers and not consumers and we shouldn't see much of a price decrease.
5. Fun PS: if you think oil companies have substantial market power that has exacerbated gas price growth, why would you think they wouldn't also capture this tax cut?

Given this, we have little reason to believe that a suspension of a gas tax would lead to much relief for drivers. That alone makes this poor policy unless you really want to subsidize those poor oil companies. But this policy is also (mildly) inflationary in an environment where the Fed is already having to do substantial rate hikes in an effort to curb it. 

In summary, subsidizing demand during a shortage is bad economics unless you have a really strong desire to give oil companies more money! If Biden wants to provide relief from high gas prices he should try to increase refinery capacity, reduce demand (maybe by subsidizing transit, particularly in dense cities with existing transit infrastructure), or if you had to give people money you should do it in lump sump payments not by subsidizing the exact thing that's currently experiencing a shortage!",flavorless_beef,t2_6g7e1abu,0.97,819,112

Jordan Peterson thinks that women joining the workforce effectively cuts wages in two, heroically engaging in a lump of labor fallacy of the crudest kind. On the contrary, it seems [""every 10 percent increase in female labor force participation rates is associated with an increase in real wages of nearly 5 percent.""](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jors.12336). Even a decrease of 5% sounds reasonable compared to Peterson's 50%.

Because women have access to the birth control pill now and can compete in the same domains as men roughly speaking there is a real practical problem here. It's partly an economic problem now because **when I was roughly your age, it was still possible for a one-income family to exist. Well you know that wages have been flat except in the upper 1% since 1973. Why? Well, it's easy. What happens when you double the labor force? What happens? You halve the value of the labor. So now we're in a situation where it takes two people to make as much as one did before. So we went from a situation where women's career opportunities were relatively limited to where there they were relatively unlimited and there were two incomes (and so women could work) to a situation where women have to work and they only make half as much as they would have otherwise.** Now we're going to go in a situation—this is the next step—where women will work because men won't. And that's what's coming now. There was an Economist article showing that 50% now of boys in school are having trouble with their basic subject. Look around you in universities—you can see this happening. I've watched it over decades. I would say 90% of the people in my personality class are now women. There won't be a damn man left in university in ten years except in the STEM fields. And it's a complete bloody catastrophe. And it's a catastrophe for women because I don't know where the hell you're gonna find someone to, you know, marry and have a family with if this keeps happening. ...

682,x0u8ff,2022-08-29,badeconomics,Twitter discovers a study from 1986 demolishing capitalism,"One of the more improbable memes that have attained virality on Twitter is a study from 1986 titled ""[Capitalism, Socialism, and the Physical Quality of Life](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.2190/AD12-7RYT-XVAR-3R2U)"" by Ceresto and [Waitzkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Waitzkin). If you've never heard of this groundbreaking work in comparative economic systems, that might be because it was published not in any economics journal but in the *International Journal of Health Services*, the *American Journal of Public Health*, and *Medical Anthropology*, where it was reviewed by the finest minds in the field of medicine. In the paper, the authors conclude that socialist societies enjoy a higher quality of life when measured against comparably wealthy capitalist societies across a wide range of metrics.

>In 30 of 36 comparisons between countries at similar levels of economic development, socialist countries showed more favorable PQL outcomes (p < .05 by two-tailed t-test). This work with the World Bank's raw data included cross-tabulations, analysis of variance, and regression techniques, which all confirmed the same conclusions. The data indicated that the socialist countries generally have achieved better PQL outcomes than the capitalist countries at equivalent levels of economic development.

This stunning indictment of capitalism languished in obscurity for nearly thirty years until it was rescued from oblivion thanks to the power of the Internet. It was especially publicized by [Jason Hickel](https://nitter.kavin.rocks/i/status/1528326657500758016), an economic anthropologist committed to the degrowth movement, who noted its findings in a series of Tweets. (Hickel, incidentally, [claims inspiration](https://nitter.kavin.rocks/jasonhickel/status/1293574692192706560) from [Samir Amin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samir_Amin#Cambodia), best known for his work on the degrowth movement in Cambodia.) Now that a new generation of young thinkers has been introduced to this empirical confirmation of socialism's superiority, this study has become one of the most widely cited works in the unending online debates on the merits of capitalism versus socialism.

***

The methodology of the study is simple. Using data from the World Bank's [*World Development Report 1983*](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/5966/WDR%201983%20-%20English.pdf), the study groups countries into one of five income categories.

* low-income
* lower-middle-income
* upper-middle-income
* high-income
* high-income oil-exporting

Then it groups countries into one of three political categories:

* capitalist
* socialist
* recent postrevolutionary (i.e., experienced a revolution within the last twenty years)

Then it compares the average outcomes of the capitalist, socialist, and postrevolutionary countries in the same income groups, finding that the socialist countries outperform capitalist countries, thereby debunking capitalism once and for all.

Or does it?

***

**Problem 1: capitalist overachievers don't count**

Suppose Paraguay and Uruguay are competing at the Olympics. Paraguay wins 19 gold medals and some silver and bronze. Uruguay wins zero gold medals, only silver and bronze. Uruguayan nationalists claim that although Uruguay has no gold medalists, Uruguay's silver and bronze medalists are on average stronger and faster than Paraguay's silver and bronze medalists—therefore, Uruguay produces the superior athletes. Is this a fair comparison, or just cope?

That's basically what this study does—it lists 19 high-income capitalist countries but zero socialist ones. The high-income countries outperform all other income groups, both capitalist and socialist, on almost all metrics. A capitalist country that graduated from low- or middle-income to high-income, like Japan, is not treated as a data point in capitalism's favor—instead, it moves into a league of its own where it can't be compared to any comparably wealthy socialist country because none exist. It becomes too successful to compare. The complete absence of high-income socialist countries is not a phenomenon that interests the authors or informs their conclusions.

**Problem 2: socialist underachievers don't count**

Two of the most destructive socialist regimes were Cambodia's Khmer Rouge and Ethiopia's Derg and their achievements were well-known by 1986. Yet the study's list of socialist countries includes neither. Instead, these countries are grouped in the ""postrevolutionary"" category along with a bunch of other basket cases, ostensibly because any regime younger than twenty years is too young to fully manifest the benefits of socialism.

>Recent Postrevolutionary Countries

>Low-income: Kampuchea, Laos, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Mozambique, Yemen (People’s Democratic Republic), Angola, Nicaragua, Zimbabwe

The authors, however, are optimistic about their embrace of socialism.

>Many of the recent postrevolutionary societies (which we treated as a separate category in the data analysis) have adopted socialist systems. Predictably, these countries may witness improvements in PQL during the next decade that will differentiate them from other countries at their level of economic development.

**Problem 3: poor socialist states are actually capitalist**

Make a guess: how many low-income socialist countries were there in 1983? If you know anything about the era, you'd probably guess a few in Asia and more than a few in Africa, right?

The correct answer, according to the study, is that there was only one—China. Every dirt-poor country that isn't China is capitalist, no matter how red their flag is.

The authors pulled a neat trick. There were a lot of poor socialist countries in 1983 that might make socialism look bad. So the study herds all the poorest, shittiest socialist countries in the world into the capitalist category, compares them solely against China under Deng Xiaoping, and concludes that capitalism objectively sucks. Here is their taxonomy of regimes:

>**Capitalist Countries**

>Low-income: Bhutan, Chad, Bangladesh, Nepal, Burma, Mali, Malawi, Zaire, Uganda, Burundi, Upper Volta, Rwanda, India, Somalia, Tanzania, Guinea, Haiti, Sri Lanka, Benin, Central African Republic, Sierra Leone, Madagascar, Niger, Pakistan, Sudan, Togo, Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, Mauritania, Yemen (Arab Republic), Liberia, Indonesia.

>Lower-middle-income: Lesotho, Bolivia, Honduras, Zambia, Egypt, El Salvador, Thailand, Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Morocco, Nigeria, Cameroon, Congo, Guatemala, Peru, Ecuador, Jamaica, Ivory Coast, Dominican Republic, Colombia, Tunisia, Costa Rica, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Paraguay, South Korea, Lebanon.

>Upper-middle-income: Iran, Iraq, Algeria, Brazil, Mexico, Portugal, Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Uruguay, Venezuela, Greece, Hong Kong, Israel, Singapore, Trinidad and Tobago, Ireland, Spain, Italy, New Zealand.

>High-income: United Kingdom, Japan, Austria, Finland, Australia, Canada, Netherlands, Belgium, France, United States, Denmark, West Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland.

>High-income oil-exporting: Libya, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates.

>**Socialist Countries**

>Low-income: China.

>Low-middle-income: Cuba, Mongolia, North Korea, Albania.

>Upper-middle-income: Yugoslavia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, U.S.S.R., Czechoslovakia, East Germany.

So Somalia, then an avowedly Marxist–Leninist state that nationalized everything in sight in the name of scientific socialism, was actually an exotic example of capitalism. The Burmese Way to Socialism is actually just capitalism. Tanzania's Julius Nyerere, widely admired by socialists all the world over for his collectivization program, was no socialist at all but a capitalist in disguise. Sékou Touré, Guinea's fiery Marxist dictator of thirty years and Lenin Peace Prize laureate, was but an agent of capitalism all along. So too was Mathieu Kérékou of Benin and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia. Madagascar claimed to be a Marxist regime explicitly modeled on North Korea from 1975 to 1992, but in reality, it was just capitalism. India claims to be a socialist country in the preamble of its constitution and nationalized vast swathes of the economy, but that's still capitalism. Pakistan nationalized entire industries under its socialist prime minister Bhutto, but that's not real socialism.

Reading this list, you'd never know that socialism had ever arrived in Africa. All those African socialist governments serenaded by the likes of sympathetic radicals like [Basil Davidson](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/09/basil-davidson-obituary) were apparently capitalist dupes. Even Davidson had the honesty to eventually [admit](https://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5615) that the socialist projects he had been an enthusiastic supporter of had been tried and found wanting.

>Socialism in any of its statist forms in Africa has certainly failed wherever one or other of such forms has been applied beyond the mere verbiage of propaganda, and there may be a true sense in which history, in this dimension, has indeed ended.

But the study opts to retcon the history of socialism in Africa, and instead blames every basket case on the continent on capitalism and nothing but.

***

I was not the only one to notice that many of these countries were wrongly categorized. [The same objection](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.77.2.242-a) was raised in response to the paper by a Dr. Kwon.

>Grouping countries into capitalist and socialist blocks based on whether they are market or centrally planned economies is misleading and inadequate for measuring the economic impact on quality of life. Although countries such as Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Nepal are non-communist countries, they cannot be classified as truly capitalist countries because the major portion of their GNP is generated by government-owned and planned industries. To that extent, they are centrally planned economies and not market-oriented economies. The correct measurement unit is the degree to which the government interferes with the market system, rather than the outward appearance of the economic system. If the above definition is used, more than half of those countries classified into the capitalist group by the authors would be reclassified into centrally planned economies with potentially significant impact on the authors' findings.

The authors retort,

>Dr. Kwon claims that ""more than half"" of the 100 countries we have classified as capitalist would be classified instead as centrally planned economies if we used as the measurement unit ""the degree to which the government interferes with the market system."" Dr. Kwon does not cite a reference or other justification for this claim. **The World Bank and the United Nations identify only 13 countries as centrally planned economies. These are the countries that we have classified as socialist. We reaffirm the validity of this classification**, as well as the favorable PQL outcomes that the socialist countries have achieved.

But wait—recall their passage on ""postrevolutionary"" societies.

>Many of the recent postrevolutionary societies (which we treated as a separate category in the data analysis) **have adopted socialist systems**. Predictably, these countries may witness improvements in PQL during the next decade that will differentiate them from other countries at their level of economic development.

So in their paper, the authors admit that there are societies beyond the thirteen they have chosen to label as socialist that actually have ""adopted socialist systems"" and will enjoy the benefits of socialist development, but which they have chosen to categorize separately simply because they are too young for the purposes of their comparison. Yet in their response to Kwon, they pretend that only the thirteen countries which the World Bank considers ""centrally planned economies"" constitute an exhaustive list of socialist countries, excluding countries like the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. They plainly contradict themselves in order to avoid having to admit that the World Bank's categorizations was flawed.

The defects in this study are so glaring that I'm inclined to attribute them to deceptive intent on the part of the authors rather than mere incompetence. I find it hard to believe that they would accidentally classify avowedly communist countries as capitalist ones, especially as socialist thinkers who must have been deeply interested in the progress of socialist movements around the world.",gary_oldman_sachs,t2_ce0ykb14,0.96,802,102

-----

In [their new video][1], Economics Explained talks about the apparently ongoing hyperinflation in the US.

Since *Economics Explained* is a mascot of r/badeconomics at this point, I imagine whatever they'll have to say about hyperinflation is wrong, so I decided to comment this video as I watch it.

**WARNING:** I fully expect myself to just repeat ""[read Sargent (1984)][2]"" and ""go look at [10-year TIPS spreads][3]"" for this entire article.

# The Video

Spends the first few minutes talking about hyperinflation in Weimar Republic, Hungary and Zimbabwe. Then, around 2:25 drops this gem:

> There are a few common trends: Some kind of destabilizing event which is corrected with stimulus measures funded by the printing of money. Unfortunately, almost all of these examples result in some form of failed state.

This gets the causality backwards.

Hyperinflation happens when people stop believing that new government debt will be repaid. A failed state **precedes** the hyperinflation event -- people would buy the new government debt if they thought it had value. Mismanagement of monetary policy compounds the original problem.

Second, stimulus measures under an economic downturn is standard countercyclical policy (eg. emitting new debt during downturns and paying it off during booms). This is good because it dampens the [business cycle][4] -- makes downturns shorter and tampers market manias. What matters is the numbers involved, simply doing this is normal.

Note that the central bank is more successful at countercyclical policy in a democracy because it's an independent institution. Fiscal policy (eg. the government spending money) is dictated by politicians who answer to voters who get their information in idiotic youtube videos. So the government on average doesn't quite hit the mark for ""spend more in downturns"" and ""pay off that debt in good times"".

On the other hand, monetary policy (fiddling with the amount of money in the economy and the interest rate), which is dictated by the independent central bank, will tend to get countercyclical closer to correct, because it's run by a bunch of nerds whose only goal is to keep unemployment low and inflation at 2%.

This is immediately followed by this:

> Market crashes might sting a few investors and push average people's retirements back a few years, but for those with the fortitude to hold onto a broad portfolio everything ends up fine.

What an astoundingly tone deaf comment.

The problem with a market crash isn't that your robinhood account goes red. It's that **people might lose their jobs**.

Compare the NASDAQ index, the unemployment rate and [the GDP Per Capita](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-10.36.41-PM-1024x435.png)

Notice that, for an investor, the 2000 dot-com bubble was a worse event than the 2008 housing market crash. The 2008 financial crisis was worse for, you know, *everyone else* because it had a bigger effect on GDP and unemployment.

Around 3:15, they then state:

> The only way to stop hyperinflation is a massive regime change, or total abandonment of a sovereign currency. Hyperinflation is Game Over.

I don't expect Economics Explained to do serious research, but hyperinflation aficionados know counterexamples. This wasn't the case in, say, the 1921 Austrian hyperinflation, which stopped after Austria agreed to make their central bank independent from the government to the League of Nations.

Hyperinflation is more of a political than economic problem. Again, ""[read Sargent (1984)][2]"". The key procedure to stop hyperinflation is to make the central bank independent from the people running the government budget -- from the conclusion: *""The establishment of an independent central bank which is legally committed to refuse additional unsecured credit to the government""*.

While regime change is often followed shortly, this is because the people running the failed state generally caused hyperinflation in the first place. For instance, nobody expects things to get better in Venezuela as long as Maduro is in power. However it's at least possible stop the Bolivar from being worthless by isolating the central bank from Maduro.

# United States of America, 2020

This section (around 4:00) starts with mentioning that the US central bank printed more than a third of the money supply in 2020, but it might ""be different than historic cautionary tales"". [Let's break that down with a graph.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-17-at-8.54.35-AM-1024x430.png)

M2 Money Supply is a common measure of the amount of money in the economy.

The ""10-Year Breakeven inflation rate"" is the ""TIPS Spread"", or the difference in price between inflation-protected government debt, or [TIPS][5] and regular government debt. The TIPS Spread is effectively what the market thinks what inflation will be at in 10 years. If someone thought that market predicted inflation is wrong they can make money by buying or shorting the regular (or inflation protected) debt.

We can see that the TIPS market reacts almost instantly to changes in macroeconomic variables that affect inflation. The increase in M2 money supply has been ""priced in"" a long time ago. People with real money on the line currently think inflation in 10 years will be around 2.4% (the current TIPS Spread).

**Several minutes of poor inflation analogies later**

We eventually come to to an argument that because parts of the stock market are up, there's inflation (~9:10)

> it's fair to say that this collection of 500 companies [S&P 500] is less good than it was 16 months ago. It's producing less, making less profits [...] it would therefore stand to reason that all other things being equal this index would be exchangeable for fewer USD today [...] in fact it's actually exchangeable for 30 more dollars than it was at the beginning of 2020 so either this equation is totally illogical or the true value of dollars has fallen

(hint: it's the former)

Stock prices reflect the *expected future flow of profits*, not the current value. Otherwise, companies not making profits would have a stock price of zero.

It's possible that the monetary stimulus was misallocated into an asset bubble -- lowering interest rates and pumping money into the economy serves to incentivize risk taking (more loans to businesses, etc.). In a pandemic it's possible this investment fuels pure speculation rather than productive uses.

> So far price hikes have been exclusively in asset markets like stocks, cryptocurrencies, real estate and raw materials. But despite the direct relationship between these markets and the markets for consumer goods and services the consumer price index that actually has remained stubbornly low.

You don't get to choose subsets of the economy to make general claims about inflation. Apple having a growing market cap doesn't mean there's inflation. TV's getting cheaper doesn't mean there's deflation, either.

Moreover, these are four entirely separate things with their own dynamics.

For instance, there's a pretty clear [speculative bubble][6] in growth stocks (Tesla, Gamestop, etc.). Cryptocurrencies' sole purpose is to be a speculative vehicle (and launder money) so they're also [in a bubble][7].

On the other hand, raw materials are at a premium largely because it's hard to make them when there's, you know, a pandemic throwing a wrench in supply lines.

House prices will be a topic for another day, but there are many trends between [zoning regulations][8] driving lack of inventory and [almost all wage growth][9] in the last 40 years being found in college educated workers living in cities -- leading to this being captured by colleges and urban landowners respectively.

685,kwicce,2021-01-13,badeconomics,The Gravel Institute and Richard Wolff do not understand Capitalism or Global Poverty,"RI: The Gravel Institute and Richard Wolff argue that Capitalism hasn't reduced global poverty, but instead has exacerbated it or at most not helped mitigate poverty. Where poverty has reduced, like China, this is a result of socialist policies, not capitalism. Countries that have adopted ""American style Capitalism"" have been unable to reduce poverty. Many of the Gravel Institutes claims derive from ignoring the policies of countries like China that reduced their poverty rate and real reasons why absolute poverty has risen and why proportional poverty is difficult to measure and reduce.

I also personally felt that u/Parasat16 response was lacking in areas

I want to make a video in response, but considering the amount of sources and subjects, it'd be valuable to get some feedback and corrections from people more astute on the subjects than my layman's understanding.

[the Gravel Institute's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co4FES0ehyI&t=160s&ab_channel=TheGravelInstitute) and the channel more broadly, is meant to be a response to the arguments provided by PragerU, Libertarians and free market fundamentalists. By claiming that Capitalism and reducing poverty are diametrically opposed is both highly reductive and misunderstands economic development and the role of markets.

*Markets, will always exist. From merchant traders in ancient Phonecia to financial traders in the London stock exchange, each accrued and reinvested the wealth generated from their activities, whether speculating on commodities or shipping luxury goods through the Mediterranean. Rather capitalism should be better seen as a net of various functions and policies that can support markets and the degree to which they operate. There is no purely free market society as there is no society truly devoid of free markets as people seek to trade and accumulate wealth.

What’s so greatly misunderstood by the Gravel institute and other free market fundamentalists is that capitalism isn’t an ends onto itself but a tool wielded by policy makers and governments in how they use the wealth acquired from commercial activity. Markets can be relegated or deregulated through an almost endless series of choices in order, in theory at least, to create a prosperous society or in the case of dictatorships and monarchies, at least support them and their cronies.

I want to look at Wolff's objections to the global poverty rate and what he believes reduced it, something that even with all the goal posts placed in the video is recognized.

>According to the world bank, anyone making under $1.90 is considered poor, anyone else is considered ok. Could you live on $1.90 a day?

This is a very disingenuous straw-manning of the WB's position. No serious institution or academic is claiming that people above $1.90/d is ""ok"", in fact, the world bank [sites in their overview](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview) of poverty that there are different baselines that can be used and that its [derived](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/brief/global-poverty-line-faq) from the PPP of the 15 poorest nations. Its not necessarily useful for the poverty in middle or high income nations, but rather the global challenges and commitments agreed upon by countries.

>The UN doesn't think so

Unsurprisingly, its actually hard to get 190 nations to agree on what constitutes extreme poverty.

So many WB economists have looked to [adjust the poverty line](https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/richer-array-international-poverty-lines) relative to nation's income bracket from low income nations at $1.90/d to high income nations at $21.70/d. The world bank has recently adopted these new baselines in their measurements, they can be found at [PovcalNet](http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povDuplicateWB.aspx) and if we set it to $5.50/d as the baseline, we'll see a less incredible, but still impressive decline of 66% to 43% since 1981 to 2017. If we employ Wolff's $7.40 we still find that the proportion of people increasing their wealth has [still risen](https://ourworldindata.org/no-matter-what-global-poverty-line) and those making below have declined.

To better understand poverty is to look less at the income statistics and look at that the material wealth between peoples at those different income tiers, especially in very poor nations.

Thanks to the late Hans Rolsing and his family, we can actually do this via [Gapminder and dollarstreet](https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street). What we can find is two things: there are materially different conditions between income groups and that the ""$1.90"" baseline is insufficient, yet even a [Liberian family](https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street/families/blamoh) living on $116 a month has considerably better conditions than a [Malawian family](https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street/families/wizilamu-01) living on $39/m

Here's where things get pretty stupid and dishonest on GI and Wolff's part:

>Using this more realistic number, the number of people in poverty has increased over the last 4 decades

I wonder what happened over this 4 decades, could it be that the world population increased by 3.4 ***billion*** people? Nearly all of it concentrated in [Asia and Africa?](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth) States that suffer from weak institutions, corruption and conflict?

Wolff then goes to address what has caused the reduction of the proportion of those in poverty:

>As a matter of fact, almost all that reduction of poverty has been in one country, China, not in countries where American styled capitalism was exported

A to unpack here. First off:

Going back to [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/fw/income-mountains/), and [research](https://voxeu.org/article/greatest-reshuffle-individual-incomes-industrial-revolution) by Branko Milanovic shows most countries have seen their populations incomes rise over the last few decades, but crucially as Charles Kenny has [explained](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/really-global-poverty-falling-honest), the absolute and proportion of those in extreme or high poverty is simply because poor countries have sidestepped the Malthusian trap by being able to import food stuffs, have access to healthcare or are reaping secondary benefits of healthcare accomplishments like eradicating polio and small pox plus access to technology. For example, its very hard to value the economic benefit of having access to a mobile network or the internet.

Next; what the fuck does ""american style capitalism"" mean? This definition isn't qualified by the Gravel institute, so its very difficult to properly understand what they mean.

If we're talking property rights, ability to open business and raise capital and private investment, China, along with the rest of the emerging world, have supported these goals. Nations which adopted centrally planned economies, like India and Vietnam, languished in poverty whilst South Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Singapore grew their domestic markets substantially. The ideas of socialism, collectivization and central planning have failed both in practice and purely politically. Countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh, countries even today that suffer poverty, corruption and weak institutions are [very supportive of free markets even if they cause inequality](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2014/10/09/emerging-and-developing-economies-much-more-optimistic-than-rich-countries-about-the-future/).

Importantly high income nations tend to be more skeptical of ""free markets"", this is perhaps because of failures of policy makers to properly redistribute at least some of the gains properly plus greater concerns of inequality. But among poor and emerging markets its very clear; ""American styled Capitalism"" is very popular

If we're talking economic liberalization and free trade, after WW2, in 1947 the GATT was signed eventually leading to the WTO in 1995 reducing the global avg tariffs over the last 70 years. Of course, further regional trading blocs have arisen, like RCEP and ACFTA, to further increase and liberalise regional trade.

Mind you though, its been argued countries weren't nessecary fully open markets, but indeed did practice a level of trade protectionism and many subsidies to their industries to generate exports, this has been heavily researched like [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1344538?seq=1).

On the other hand, Arvind Panagariya has [documented and researched](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3501729) how the import substitution industrialization model often fails than it does succeed.

>China accomplished this with massive government spending and industrial programs

Any, non-concave brained person can simply point to numerous [studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326492289_China's_40_years_of_agricultural_development_and_reform) that [show](https://www.nber.org/papers/w21397) broad shift away from collectivization, particularly of land in the adoption of the ""household responsibility system"", openness to foreign investment.

Rozelle and Huang write:

>It is easy to illustrate the consequences of these policies. In the early reform period (1977–84), grain production rose by 34 per cent (NBS 2010). As a result, farmers were able to allocate more land, water, labour and capital to cash crop production. This effort to diversify agriculture helped the rural population raise their earnings in the early reform years...  
>  
>...Because the production of nongrain commodities and livestock is more labour intensive, the diversification of China’s agricultural economy helped address the underemployment that had plagued rural China during the entire PRC period. Diversification led to an increase in the number of days farmers could work and this raised their income.

So is this ""socialism"" as described by Wolff? Or domestic markets being more open and being assisted by the govt to boost national development? How truly different is this from ""American style capitalism"" in so much that one could call it ""socialist""?

>The real problem is the system, a system that implodes every 47 years, that pushed more and more people into deep poverty

This has already been more or less addressed already, but I really don't understand what metrics they're using. In fact, if we move away from looking at income and instead look at social welfare, like the provision of healthcare, shelter, education and sanitation, they're argument doesn't hold up much either.

For the last decade, the Oxford Poverty & Human Development Initiative has [published](https://ophi.org.uk/multidimensional-poverty-index/) the Multidimensional Poverty Index which tracks the Sustainable Development Goals of 105 countries. Of the 5.7 Billion people that live in developing countries, 23.3% or 1.3 Billion, live in MDI poverty. This is perhaps a more useful tool for measuring poverty than the traditional the $1.90 figure or just GDP per cap measures. In any case, the MDI shows that poverty has still fallen, and fallen very fast in many countries still suffering endemic poverty. India has gone from 55% of its population being MDI poor in 2005 to 28% in 2015.

On Cuba, which Wolff points to, their life expectancy and morality rates are biased and purposefully flawed to increase the perceived gains in their healthcare efforts, simply put, [Cuba isn't ""healthier"" than the US](https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/33/6/755/5035051)

If we were to look to rich countries, even the US, Wolff does has some point regarding booms and busts harming middle and lower income earners, but poverty rates have more or less stayed stable in most high income nations for the last couple decades.

>The fact is Capitalists have always fought against those policies (social welfare)

Again, because its not qualified, its hard to understand this statement.

Firstly, in terms of policies, the same [pew research article](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2014/10/09/emerging-and-developing-economies-much-more-optimistic-than-rich-countries-about-the-future/) shows that many developing and a few developed states want low taxes whilst most developed states want high taxes. In the US, there's [broad consensus](https://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11502464/gilens-page-oligarchy-study) on a lot of policies between the rich and the middle class, including progressive taxation. So who exactly are these ""capitalists"" that oppose such actions?

A more indepth dive has been done by Torben Iversen and David Soskice in ""Democracy and Prosperity"" and they generally find that, in fact, the more advanced an economy, the *more limited* business interests become as they get spatially anchored and the expense of investments making exiting the market quite difficult and costly. Historically, business and the middle class wanted greater support into social services like education and sanitation so to build up the human capital that would be ultilsied by said capitalists. In free and fair democracies, Politicians will want to both increase the wellbeing of most citizenry while also increasing the size of the economy to carry out their own objectives, this almost inevitably leads to some redistribution.

This leads to the overall point that ""Capitalism"" didn't make or break poverty in countries, instead, domestic micro and macroeconomic policies and programs helped alleviate misery using the wealth generated by openness to markets internally. This leads to successive development as a country's population becomes more educated, healthy, secure in their livelihoods and willing to invest their livelihoods into new ideas and activities. Wolff's argument that advanced economies are successful due to large investment from the government is largely true, and is what we see in nearly every developed state.

(When the state actually properly functions, like in the case of the CARES act in the US, poverty went [down](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/us/politics/coronavirus-poverty.html) and probably would have gone lower if the HEROES act was actually passed and enacted. Only one party and one executive admin is responsible for that.)

However, due to the complexity of nations, from the local to regional level, there is no guarantee. Financial contagion, like in Indonesia in '97, a freak natural disaster like in Haiti, ethnic and religious splits like in Lebanon, Ethiopia and Nigeria, intense corruption like in Venezuela, Pakistan and South Africa and of course global pandemics can rapidly reserve and shift the gains accrued, irregardless of the economic growth model followed. This, to me, is the refutation to the free market orthodoxy, capitalism and free markets doesn't inherently solve or mitigate these issues but requires fair and clear rule of law, pluralism, security and crucially an openness to changes, risks and challenges.

TL;DR Gravel Institute is lazy and overly reductive when it comes to global poverty and capitalism

686,12yrk07,2023-04-25,badeconomics,Stop comparing the number of vacant homes to the number of homeless people,"It's become a [common](https://www.reddit.com/r/REBubble/comments/trm3sr/16_million_vacant_homes_in_america_the_house/) [sentiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ABoringDystopia/comments/ttg8v9/usa_homeless_people_vs_vacant_homes/) on Reddit, subject of [numerous](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/314png/til_in_europe_there_are_more_vacant_homes_than/) [TILs](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2695mt/til_there_are_over_5_vacant_houses_to_every/). It's a common retort--some Redditor [suggests we need more housing](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/11xmlcn/comment/jd4dad5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and then [someone else smacks it down](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/11xmlcn/comment/jd53os2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by [pointing out](https://www.reddit.com/r/LandlordLove/comments/11t88mm/comment/jciq990/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that we have enough vacant homes to cover every homeless person, thus disproving the housing shortage once and for all.

It seems like an intuitive idea—the homes are there, the issue is they're empty. It is also completely incorrect.

Here, I'll go over what we mean when we say there is a ""housing shortage"", how the housing supply relates to homelessness, and why this a bad test of whether housing supply is an issue that needs to be addressed. Since I intend to refer back to this, I'm going to go through this issue at a fairly basic level that should be understandable to anyone with knowledge of basic economics concepts.

**What is the housing shortage?**

It's often said we have a housing shortage, but it's worth clarifying what that actually means. In economics, shortage has a more technical meaning—it refers to a market that, for some reason, is out of equilibrium. For example, if the government were to impose a price cap on bananas that was below the market clearing price, a shortage would result. Colloquially, we use the term ""shortage"" to refer to things that we want more of. If we don't have as many doctors as we want, we might say we have a shortage of doctors. The market for doctors may very well be in equilibrium—the equilibrium price is just very high. This would be a shortage in the colloquial sense, but not necessarily in the economic sense. This becomes especially confusing because economists sometimes use the term shortage in the colloquial way as well.

When it comes to the housing market, the term shortage is being used in the colloquial sense. Specifically, we are concerned about the slope and position of the supply curve. A well functioning housing market [should look something like this](https://imgur.com/a/QPiLq2C) in the long run. The supply curve slopes gently upwards because we can build more units. Over time, the [price of housing will trend to the marginal cost of construction](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.32.1.3). Unfortunately, as has been [extensively discussed by me](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/y3kcxk/comment/isavyl5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and a bunch of other people here and in AE, local restrictions means that many of the hottest housing markets [actually look something like this](https://imgur.com/a/dS3RUe5). Since it's almost always illegal or extremely difficult to build more housing, supply is very inelastic. That means that if demand increases, it manifests [almost entirely in higher prices](https://imgur.com/a/bROuUF6) instead of more housing units.

**So why are homes vacant and can we put homeless people in them?**

So if housing markets in many cities are so hot, why are some homes sitting empty? And should we start randomly assigning homeless people to live in them?

Part of the problem comes when people look at a country as one homogenous market--it doesn't help that we have an old, abandoned home in rural Mississippi and a homeless person in New York. The places with the biggest issues with homelessness [are actually those with the lowest vacancy rates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1051137700902638). But none the less, the issue persists to some degree even if you look at individual cities so let's dig into this a bit more. A house can be vacant for many reasons--luckily [the Census Bureau breaks](https://data.census.gov/table?q=B25004:+VACANCY+STATUS&g=010XX00US&tid=ACSDT1Y2021.B25004) it down for us.

Let's use LA metro area as a case study since it's a high-cost housing market that is perennially fucked. In total, there are a little over 300,000 vacant homes in 2021 (out of a total of nearly 5 million units). Of those, over 50% are just homes between residents (the previous residents have moved out, new residents have not yet moved in). Another 10% are locked up for repairs/renovations. About 15% are occasional/seasonal use, and the remainder fall to a variety of smaller categories (legal proceedings, condemned, extended absence, etc).

As you may have gleaned  from those numbers, housing vacancies are a normal part of a healthy housing market that cannot be entirely avoided. Just as there is a natural (and healthy) rate of unemployment in labor markets, there is also a [natural rate of vacancy in the housing market](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10835547.2010.12091288?journalCode=rjer20) that arises due to a variety of frictions. 

In fact, [California's rental vacancy rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CARVAC) is near a historical low. If filling vacant homes was a solution to homelessness, California should be leading the nation, and [not in the way they currently are](https://staticweb.usafacts.org/media/images/california-vermont-and-oregon-have-the-nation.width-1200.png). People move, and it's not always possible for the next residents to move in the same day. Houses need repairs, and it's not always ideal or even possible for residents to stay while that happens. That's why studies of vacancy taxes generally find they can push a few units back onto the market but it's a fairly small number in comparison to the overall housing market. A vacancy tax in France [decreased the vacancy rate by 13%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272719301409) (meaning the rate was 5% when they estimate it would have been closer to 6% without the tax). If LA metro area could accomplish a similar feet, it would basically amount to a supply increase of less than 1%. 

But let's say we created a dramatically more effective policy that reduces vacancies by 50%--maybe we ban renovations (you can suffer with your 80s-style cabinets forever), allow people to move just once every ten years, and ban second homes (which should free up a lot 8-bedroom mega-mansions for the multi-millionaires looking for an upgrade). Would that solve homelessness?

No, and I would go as far as to say it would barely even make a dent. If you think about LA as a closed economy (meaning it cannot interact with the outside world), then it seems natural that many of the available homes would be occupied by homeless residents. But since LA is an open economy, homeless people have to compete with residents of other cities that wish to move to LA alongside increased household formation within LA. To shamelessly steal phrasing from u/flavorless_beef, the housing market isn't just about the people that currently live in LA, it's about the people that *want* to live there but currently can't.

So it's incorrect to think that just because LA has enough housing to cover all *current* residents in a hypothetical world where housing market frictions don't exist that it has enough housing. In reality, LA should have enough homes for all the households that *want* to live there (regardless of whether they currently do) and could afford to do so at the equilibrium that would occur if supply restrictions were removed (with some additional units vacant due to the aforementioned frictions).

**Yes, more housing supply can help reduce homelessness**

Now it *is* true that increasing housing supply will reduce costs, and [lower housing costs reduce homelessness](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23868747/) ([ungated version here](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w16826/w16826.pdf)). The issue is that pushing vacant homes back onto the market can't produce a large supply increase in the places where we need it. Luckily, loosening local restrictions can.

To put some numbers to it, [one recent paper](https://docs.iza.org/dp15447.pdf) estimates that in the absence of supply constraints, LA county (not quite the same as LA metro area but whatever) would see a 44% increase in housing supply. Even the most optimistic vacancy policy imaginable would cover just a small fraction of that. Regardless of whether you buy that specific number, it's clear that vacant homes aren't going to provide a solution to high housing costs or homelessness.

How much difference could a better regulatory environment make for LA in reducing costs? [Glaeser & Gyourko (2018)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.32.1.3) estimated that back in 2013, prices were roughly double the cost of marginal construction. Since then, [houses have more than doubled in price](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LXXRSA#0). Building costs have come up as well, but likely not by the same magnitude. None the less, the price of a house could likely be cut in half at minimum if restrictions were sufficiently loose. Even smaller improvements at the margin are worth pursuing though.

To be clear, fixing housing markets cannot entirely solve the problem of homelessness. Housing costs can only go so low even in a loosely regulated market if demand is high--in a market like LA, the marginal cost of construction essentially acts as a long-run minimum. Even if housing costs were reduced by two-thirds, some homeless people would still be unable to afford it. To make further progress would require other policies--social programs, housing subsidies, etc. But improving the housing market can make major strides, and it's likely the closest thing to a free lunch that we're going to find in this area.

**In conclusion...**

688,obokbi,2021-07-01,badeconomics,The SAT just measures your parents' income,"There have been a lot of white-hot takes on the SAT lately. A number of highly dubious claims are being made, but I want to focus on one claim in particular that is both a) demonstrably false, and b) based on a an interesting statistical fallacy: The idea that the SAT just measures your parents' income.

This claim comes in two forms: A strong form, and a weak form. The strong form is that parental income is the main causal determinant of SAT scores. The weak form is that SAT scores are highly correlated with parental income. It's *possible* for the correlation to be weaker than the true causal effect, e.g. if there were large numbers of low-income immigrants with high-scoring children offsetting the causal effect of parental income among native-born students, but this is unlikely to be a major factor, so I'll be focusing on the weak form: Parental income just isn't that strongly correlated with SAT scores.

When making this claim, as Sheryll Cashin of Georgetown Law did at [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/06/28/college-standardized-tests-optional-sat-act-496127) recently, it's traditional to link to one of two articles, which are the top two Google hits for ""sat income correlation"" sans quotes:

* [SAT Scores and Family Income](https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/sat-scores-and-family-income/), by Catherine Rampell in the New York Times in 2009.
* [Long Clickbait Headline](https://archive.is/NqLrh), by Zachary Goldfarb in the Washington Post in 2014.

Quoth Rampell:

> There’s a very strong positive correlation between income and test scores. (For the math geeks out there, the R^2 for each test average/income range chart is about 0.95.)

Goldfarb, failing to learn from history and thereby repeating it:

> The first chart shows that SAT scores are highly correlated with income. Students from families earning more than $200,000 a year average a combined score of 1,714, while students from families earning under $20,000 a year average a combined score of 1,326.

Go look at the charts. See anything wrong?

Because these charts show average scores bucketed by income bracket, they tell us only the slope of the relationship between family income and SAT scores, and the fact that it's roughly linear. Without additional information, these charts tell us nothing about the strength of the correlation. It could be 0.1 or 0.9, and the chart of bucketed averages would look exactly the same. Only a scatterplot of individual scores and incomes would give us a visual representation of the correlation. Note the before-he-was-famous cameo from Matt Rognlie making this point in the comments.

However, with some additional data provided by the College Board, we can get a reasonable estimate of the correlation. The correlation between two variables is the normalized slope of the best-fit regression line. For example, for a correlation of 0.9, we would expect that an increase of 1&sigma; in family income would correspond to an increase of 0.9&sigma; in average SAT score.

The SAT is designed to have a mean score of 500 and standard deviation of 100 in each section. In practice, it usually misses the mark a bit. The link in Rampell's article is broken, but the document is here ([PDF](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/research/cbs-2009-national-TOTAL-GROUP.pdf)). Table 11 shows us the data we want. The standard deviations for all takers are 112 for reading and 116 for math. Note that the standard deviations for individual income brackets are only about 10% smaller than the overall standard deviations, which is not at all what we would expect if scores were highly correlated with income.

10% of takers are in the lowest income bracket and 7% are in the highest, so the midpoints of those brackets would be the 5th and 96.5th percentiles for family income, corresponding to -1.64&sigma; and 1.81&sigma; from the norm, respectively. Between the lowest and highest brackets, there is a 3.45&sigma; difference in income. The differences in scores between the highest and lowest income brackets are 129 (1.15&sigma;) in reading and 122 (1.05&sigma;) in math.

Which is to say that on average, a 1&sigma; increase in income predicts only a 0.33&sigma; increase in reading scores and a 0.30&sigma; increase in math scores. This yields a rough estimate of the correlations. Using the slope of the best fit line rather than the slope of the line connecting the first and last points would be a bit more precise, but eyeballing it, it would be unlikely to make a significant difference.

Let's sanity-check our work from a source more reliable than the two most respected newspapers in the country. A straightforward report of this correlation has been surprisingly hard to find, but the College Board ([PDF](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED562860.pdf) finds a correlation of 0.42 between composite SAT score and SES (equal weighting of father's education, mother's education, and log income) among all test takers reporting this information in 1995-7. This is plausibly consistent with the correlation found above.

As noted in the limitations section, there may be some attenuation bias due to inaccurate reporting of income by test takers, but the finding is consistent with more reliable measures of SES like parental education and occupation.

A correlation between 0.3 and 0.42 suggests that income can predict at most 9-18% of the variation in SAT scores, and vice-versa. Note ""predict"" rather than ""explain"": This should be treated as a loose upper bound on the true causal effect of income on SAT scores. I want to tread lightly here, because there's some strong anti-hereditarian sentiment among the mods, but heredity is a real thing, and it does explain some portion of the relationship between parental income and test scores. Smart people tend to have smart kids and higher incomes, ergo people with higher incomes tend to have smarter kids on average. I am making no claims here about the magnitude of this effect, only cautioning that it needs to be accounted for in order to find the true causal effect of parental income.

An important caveat here is that permanent income would likely correlate a bit more strongly with SAT scores than previous-year income would, but I'm skeptical that the correlation would be much stronger than the 0.42 correlation found for the College Board's composite SES measure discussed above. Furthermore, permanent income would *also* correlate more strongly with heritable parental traits. AFAICT, the College Board does not collect data on permanent income, and in any case, the data I'm using here are the exact same data that have been used for 12 years to support the claim of a strong correlation between parental income and SAT scores.",brberg,t2_fdq0n,0.94,652,120

##Introduction

Before I begin, a special shoutout to u/besttrousers for pointing me to a [twitter thread of economists also R1ing Ben](https://twitter.com/besttrousers/status/1162016390309699590). I will be using it thoughout this R1.. As many of you know, Ben Shapiro is a neoconservative pundit who is quite active on Twitter as well as hosting the podcast “The Ben Shapiro Show” by The Daily Wire. Many young conservatives who listen to the likes of Jordan Peterson, Charlie Kirk, Steven Crowder, etc love Ben Shapiro and his *incredibly* nuanced takes on the world. 

##The Bad Economics

[A viral clip of Ben speaking about poor people circulated the tweet-o-sphere recently](https://twitter.com/JasonSCampbell/status/1161679740354387969). If you do not wish to listen to the entire clip here is it transcribed:

>	...Well, the fact is that, if you had to work more than one job to have a roof over you head or food on the table, you probably shouldn’t have taken the job that’s not paying you enough. That’d be a you problem. Also, it is not true that the vast majority of people in the United States are working two jobs, it just is not true. According to the Census statistics, “a small but steady number of American workers have more than one job, either because they need extra income, or because they want to gain more experience or explore different interests.” There’s a recently released US Census Bureau report, and apparently what it found is that approximately 8.3%, this is as of 2013, so it’s actually lower now, 8.3% of workers had more than one job. That was as of 2013, it’s a lot lower now. So this notion that there’s tons and tons of people who are working multiple jobs, it is not really true. It is not actually the reality. In May, 5% of American’s had multiple jobs, 5%. That’s really what is bringing down the unemployment rate, is those 5% of workers who work multiple jobs? For all of the talk about people working at Uber, it’s held to that range actually, really since 2009, it’s always been a very very low number, so this again is just a lie. It is also this bizarre idiocy that you dictate to the economy, what the economy ought to do. Every time everybody tries to dictate to the economy, what it ought to do, the economy fights back, because turns out, the aggregate knowledge of the market economy knows more than you do, I know, shocking.

There is quite a bit going on here, so I’m going to split it up and synthesize it into a few claims that I will then examine. 

##”That’d be a you problem”

What Ben is essentially claiming here is, if you are poor, or need more than one job to pay for necessary goods, that is your fault. What Ben is saying is that workers have incredible amounts of market power and should be able to either 1) select jobs that pay them a wage sufficient for this basket of necessary goods, or 2) demand wages sufficient for this basket of necessary goods. So, with such an outlandish claim, all that’s really necessary is for us to find cases where workers don’t have total market power, and maybe, we can find cases where *firms* actually have market power. 

First of all, let us consider a perfectly competitive labor market: wages are set by supply and demand and neither labor nor firms have wage setting power. If we relax that assumption and, say introduce labor market frictions i.e. there are no hitches or interruptions in the flow of labor from one job to the next, it is plausible that small wage cuts will not cause workers to leave a firm, therefore a firm gains market power in the labor markets and gain wage setting powers. This is monopsony power. Even if there is more than one firm hiring for the same job, firms can still have monopsony power (and yes we all know that mono means one. So, what frictions might there be in the labor market? As we know from [Stigler, 1961](https://home.uchicago.edu/~vlima/courses/econ200/spring01/stigler.pdf) search costs can create wide disparities in price (aka wages) between 2 goods. He then goes on to demonstrate that [lack of information causes employers to pay different wage rates or go through more costly search procedures (Stigler, 1962)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1829106.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Aaedfa79c2e92539e3daf1bdd7eeb74b7). Other frictions might be the result of labor immobility with Hseih and Moretti finding that [wages might be decreased by $1.27T annually](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/chang-tai.hsieh/research/growth.pdf). There is evidence that in some cases, [wages are below MPL, largely due to monopsony power](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26101.pdf). Our resident MinWage homie Dube also found [substantial separation and hiring elasticities in certain labor markets](https://escholarship.org/content/qt27z0006g/qt27z0006g.pdf) meaning that switching jobs just ain’t that easy. Unfortunately for Ben, there seems to be plenty of evidence that labor does *not* have overwhelming wage setting powers. 

Just as a quick aside, even Adam Smith believed that firms tended to have some power in labor markets (Wealth of Nations):

>	In the long-run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him; but the necessity is not so immediate. 

##How many people???

[For reference, this is the census data that Ben is referencing](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2019/demo/P70BR-163.pdf). He is correct, when he states that it is 8.3% of workers who are working multiple jobs. But then he goes on to say that it isn’t “tons and tons of people”. Doing some back of the napkin math all rounding down for convenience, in [December of 2013, there were 155M people in the labor force](http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/laus/us/usadj.htm). Rounding down again, 8% of that is a little more than 12M people. Now for some cheekier math. [The median age of the labor force is around 40 y/o](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/median-age-labor-force.htm), and [males in the US typically weigh more than 195lbs while females typically weigh 170lbs](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm). If we take 6M males x 195 + 6M females x 170lbs we get more than **2 billion** lbs of people or 1 million tons of people. I would say that this is tons and tons of people. Back on point, more than 12 million American workers working multiple jobs is not an insignificant number. It is roughly the population of NYC and LA combined.

To discuss the rest of the data, [the rest of this thread](https://twitter.com/inclusionist/status/1161731950455005185?s=20
) does a very good job explaining that, Ben’s numbers illustrating a decline come from a completely different sample source, as well as that survey undercounting multiple job withholding. 

Sidenote, I find it interesting that he opted for the Census data, rather than the Fed data, which would have served to [strengthen his point more](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=oEv0) and show a trend. But alas, we know that Ben isn’t super well known for his statistical rigor. Or any rigor for that matter. 
___
In sum, Ben’s comments really generated a lot of outrage amongst politicians, economists, and the public alike. Largely because he insinuated that the poor are poor due to their own machinations. Logically this is so strange anyways. “People have power in labor markets to set their own wages, but they choose to be poor”, is the strangest way to assign blame to poor people for being poor. Economically, this argument has no proof, and has plenty of proof going the opposite direction.

PS: I am a poor undergrad writing his first R1, plz be nice to me. 

Edit to address some common comments: 

> You are missing Ben's point, he is really telling people to acquire marketable skills

No he isn't. It is quicker and more economically correct to say ""The best way to earn more money is to try and gain marketable skills"". Plus, I have heard him say things like this. I have been listening to his podcast for a while and when he has straight up told people to get STEM degrees and other marketable degrees word for word. This is a completely different tone and word choice from him. 

> People should move, or do XYZ to earn more money.

This isn't a bad idea in a perfectly competitive labor market, but moving or XYZ doesn't solve the problem of monopsony power

> Muh supply and demand...muh free markets

Plz stop

Then don't generalize about women yourself.

If you don't like how men are labeled as violent brutes and rapists, then don't label women as lying and manipulative harpies yourself.

If you don't like how some feminists and some women distrust all men cause they were raped or abused or are afraid to be raped, abused or killed. Then don't distrust all women yourself like every single one of them is out there looking to destroy men in some way.

If you don't like how some feminists ask women to stop dating men or having sex with them cause she thinks that men are abusive rapists. If you think that they are sexist and crazy (and they are), then don't tell men to stop dating or having sex with women cause they are all lying 'whores'' who will all destroy your life in a whim too.

I'm genuinely concerned about this sub and this movement, we are beginning to grow and be herd, and some sexist and misogynistic mothefuckers want to use this chance and jump on the wagon to spout their sexist bullshit to a bigger audience. 

And the only ones that they will be hurting in the end is men and this movement. We are sometimes having problems to have people listen and agree with our message that we are disadvantaged in some fields and that we are lacking some rights.

So do you think that people will listen to their stupid and sexist bullshit? No. They will disregard them **and** any man who would want to speak about men's rights. They will lump us all together cause those sexist turds are using this sub, this movement and our platforms to spout their mysogynistic bullshit. 

And the problem is that in many cases, they are upvoted. Especially whenever the topics of marriage, sex or dating comes up. Then they come in herds and you see all the sexist generalization about women being upvoted to the top sometimes.

We should watch out, cause not only this sub will lose any credibility we already have, this sub may be even quarantined or banned.

THE CHARGES HAVE BEEN DISMISSED!!

First and foremost, I want to thank this community. In December when I wrote my original post I was at my wits end.  My life was falling apart and I was having suicidal thoughts. At that time I had no one to talk to and felt completely alone. The outpouring of support lifted a massive weight from me. Many of you messaged me directly to express your concern, offer help, or share your similar stories. I honestly believe posting here on r/mensrights may have saved my life. One user, in particular, was a massive help. He contacted me via DM and told me he had gone through something similar quite recently. He was kind enough to tell me his real name, and a simple google search brought his sexual assault case up immediately. He gave me his number and spoke with me on the phone for several hours, which eventually lead to me hiring the same attorney.  The attorney’s name is Antoinette O’neill, and if any of you find yourself, or someone you know in the situation I was in, I can’t recommend her enough. [https://parlatorelawgroup.com/content/antoinette-quinn-oneill](https://parlatorelawgroup.com/content/antoinette-quinn-oneill).  

The amount of sexism and discrimination I felt through this whole process can’t be properly related in a reddit post. The US Military has essentially given women a get out of jail free card when it comes to sexual assault allegations, however absurd those accusations may be. My accuser has been protected at all costs. The “investigators” tore apart my life. They interviewed co-workers, acquaintances, ex-girlfriends, friends, etc. Anyone who they felt would help them prove my guilt, they spoke to. When I was originally informed of the accusation, I was told it was the investigators job to find the truth, to collect facts, and allow JAG to take things from there. When I received the Results of Investigation Report, or ROI, what stuck out immediately is investigators never once interviewed any of the “victims” friends, family, co workers, ex-boyfriends, etc. They never attempted to ascertain the validity of her claims. She told a minimum of a dozen people about the assault, including her chain of command, and not a single one of them was interviewed. They simply came at me from every conceivable angle. They interviewed people I had not seen or spoken to in YEARS. The sad truth is, if they had investigated her absurd claims, they would have discovered the truth in a short amount of time. Instead, the process took a full YEAR to complete because they never once attempted to confirm a single aspect of her story. As an example, she claimed that she could not accurately place where the sexual assault occurred. She simultaneously claimed to have used a ride share app to leave my residence and travel home. Those two statements together make zero sense. Yet they never once asked her to show the ride share app receipt, history, or contact the ride share app company for documentation of the travel. HOW IN THE FUCK DID THEY NOT ASK THAT SIMPLE OF A QUESTION!? That should have been extremely easy to produce if the statement was true. If they had, her entire story would have begun to fall apart. It was absolutely infuriating.   They interviewed anyone they could find I had contact with to see if I had ""confided"" in them about ""what I did"".  Their exact words when interviewing one of my friends.  Meanwhile, they didn't interview a single one of her friends to see if she had confided in them about the assault or any of the lies she told.  How the fuck is that not discriminatory?

After a full year of no word and my administrative hold, I was informed that JAG felt they had enough probable cause to charge me with the sexual assault, among other more minor crimes associated with the assault, and we moved onto the Article 32 hearing. This is where my attorney embarrassed the prosecution and easily ripped their remarkably weak case apart. For those unfamiliar, the Article 32 is sort of a pre trial for military members, which a 3rd party official oversees the charges and decides on their validity before proceeding to court martial. Since I refused to speak with law enforcement without an attorney, it was my first opportunity to refute the charges, show any evidence I have in my defense if I so chose too. The officiating officers’ job is to analyze both sides and decide what charges should be taken to court martial.   Due to COVID very few people were physically present in the room. It was mainly done through video teleconference. The prosecution attempted to explain and justify their bullshit charges, which included a lot of “ummm … “and rifling through paperwork to answer questions from the officiate. It was obvious they were ill prepared and inexperienced. When it came time for Toni to speak, she ripped their case apart in a matter of minutes without once looking at notes, needing to look up or reference precedent etc. She flat out embarrassed them, and in that moment, I knew she was worth every single penny I had to pay for her representation. Afterwards, I realized how I must have looked on camera while Toni was ripping them apart, cause I was staring at her in awe of her abilities. I was being charged with a life ending crime and I had a giant shit eating grin on my face watching my attorney work. It’s one thing to be told someone is good at their job, but seeing it happen in real time was impressive to say the least. A couple weeks after the Article 32 ended we received the report from the officiate. My favorite line was, which was written by a female officiate in a sexual assault case, “This case, borderline, meets the low legal standard for probable cause, but likely would not if there was the ability to cross examine the victim and witnesses”. It was explained to me the only thing necessary for a sexual assault allegation to meet probable cause is a reputable accuser. That is it. If the court believes the girl that made an accusation is of sound mind and body, and the accusation sounds possible, they have probable cause to bring charges to court martial. For my case, they said it met the low legal standard, barely, but would not if my attorney had been able to cross examine the victim or witnesses during the article 32. AKA a good attorney would have easily been able to rip her story apart if given the opportunity to question her about her absurd claims.  Later on in the report, she literally expressed (in big legal terms) that she didn’t believe the victims accusations, that multiple aspects of her story were contradictory, and most importantly, she directly benefited from the accusation which caste significant doubt on the validity of her statements. Furthermore, JAG and investigators never even proved that they had jurisdiction to investigate the claim or prosecute me. How’s that for some shit. A year of hell and nobody even checked to see if they were in their legal right to do anything. Some real high IQ’s in the legal office. After the report was published, it went up the chain. Nearly two months later I got a phone call from my attorney letting me know all charges were being dropped. No explanation on why they were, but it is not difficult to figure out. After more than a year of hell, I get a nice fancy letter signed by a general and get told to move on with my life. 

Unfortunately, in the time since then I know it is not over for me. I find that my fear and anxiety over being helpless and discriminated against has slowly turned to pure anger of the injustice of it all. She has suffered zero consequences, and more than likely won’t. The common line I’m getting from people who were informed of the situation is, “just move on.” But I can’t.  I used to lie awake at night in fear of going to prison for something I didn't do.  Having everything I've worked for my entire life gone at the word of a bitch trying to save herself.  Now, I lie awake at night knowing she got everything she wanted.  She and I still wear the same uniform.  She gets to walk around knowing she won. 

I’m considering filing a defamation of character or libel civil suit against my accuser. Her actions cost me a great deal of money, damaged my career, and to say my mental health and personal relationships have suffered is an understatement. On top of all that, the military has no way of expunging charges. For the rest of my life, when an employer runs my background check, they will see a sexual assault arrest and charge on my record. That is never going to go away.  Part of me is disappointed this didn’t go to court martial, and so was my attorney. We had so much evidence of my innocence, which is rare in sexual assault accusations, that she was looking forward to calling her out on all her lies on the witness stand. The charges may have been dropped, but since they were dropped without prejudice, the door remains open. It wasn’t an admittance that I am innocent, it was an admittance that they knew they weren’t going to get a conviction with the bullshit case they had presented. Proving she lied in court would have made me feel exonerated, instead, I just feel angry.  

If anyone has any legal resources, or a civil attorney I can have a consult with I ‘d appreciate any suggestions. My accuser and I are both military, and we are now in different states then when this all began. I don’t’ even know what state I’m supposed to file the law suit in. The state the accusation was made, the state I reside, or the state she resides? I don’t want to let the cat out of the bag just yet, but I will say I can prove she lied, and actually committed a felony while doing so. She made sworn statements in court, in front of a judge, which were complete fabrications, and I can prove it. We had all this prepared for the court martial to confront her in person. I’m hoping this leverage will aid the resolution of a civil suit, because if the military found out they would prosecute her, she would be discharged and possibly face jail time. I want justice, and you are all more than welcome to come along for the ride.  Again, Thank you all so much. You helped save me, and I am grateful.",DrShakyHandz,t2_6emtb,0.97,3920,184

We encourage you to share your opinions, experiences, and voices to help contribute to our goal in helping alleviate issues that modern men face. 

&#x200B;

Belonging to this sub does not mean that we hate women or don't care about the discrimination that you face; most of that hate that comes from this sub is geared towards the blatant media biases and hypocrisies. Similar to the BLM movement this sub is a place for ALL of us to focus on men's issues and progressive ways to help make life better for our fellow brothers, fathers, and sons everywhere. We encourage all who wish to help to participate!

&#x200B;

It is important that our ideas, posts, and methods are questioned, discussed, challenged, and even sometimes ridiculed; this is all part of a healthy dialogue and will move our cause forward.

&#x200B;

It would be a disservice to ourselves and our focus to be dismissive of any voices that hold genuine opinions and ideas. We understand that Reddit is a male dominated space, and this sub more so, But I would like to extend a personal invitation to any and all women who want to be heard in this sub to do so, and I challenge all the men in this sub to listen and hear what our female comrades have to say. Its not easy to walk into the lions den and feel safe, so we have a responsibility to foster an environment where discourse is valued.

So we at r/mensrights just want to let you women know that your opinions and experiences are valid, welcomed, and appreciated here.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0wCBFNTVhk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0wCBFNTVhk)

As ive posted before, teachers mark girls higher for IDENTICAL work, to the point where just changing to a.girls name gets a boy 1/3 grade higher mark. as well as punishing boys differently. See below for all the studies. What do you expect when feminsim teaches extreme misnadry, male privelge theory etc.... that feminise teachers will be like this. 

&#x200B;

Previous submission got deleted by mod eventually so reposting here... still check it out as many excellent comments from men and women about their experience of this bias... many pointed out very obvious misandric comments from their teachers, some teachers even commented about their biases:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers\_mark\_girls\_higher\_for\_identical\_work\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers_mark_girls_higher_for_identical_work_to/)

This is an unpopular fact as it widely held in society that women and girls are discriminated against in education and in work, indeed in everything in life.

Note; below is general statement, countless awesome teachers but....

**Education is an example of institutional sexism. Now this data should to even feminist not be surprising... after all they call male majority and even female majority places as rife with sexism and ""male norms"" i.e. women have to act like men... is it any surprise then in teaching where 98% of early educators are female, 90% primary school teachers are female and these teachers have often studied gender studies type radical subjects at uni, and all HR and admin is female, that there is ""female norms"" being applied in education..... that the default child is a girl according to teachers? As the following data shows e.g. female teachers punishing boys for entirely normal behaviour that they dont understand; marking girls higher for IDENTICAL work, and giving higher predicted grades (despite boys objectively getting higher real life assesments) as they prefer girl students as model students and can relate to girl students better.... it is no wonder that schools are reducing play times, even removing physical education completely and replacing it with in class movement.... i.e. an entirely anti boy environment.... if 40% of boys are being drugged with aderal in some schools, do you think 40% of boys are unwell or maybe its the teachers who are shit and the system they made?**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Over then entire OECD countries globally, a large scale study showed that girls were given higher marks for IDENTICAL work to boys. OECD also showed that a boy receives 1/3 higher grade if the teacher does not know he is a boy. Interestingly this gender gap goes away when it is a male teacher doing the marking.

Cornwell found that boys in all racial categories are not being *“commensurately graded by their teachers”* in any subject *“as their test scores would predict.”*

The answer lies in the way teachers, who are statistically mostly women, evaluate students without reference to objective test scores. Boys are regularly graded well below their actual academic performance.

Boys are falling significantly behind in grades, *“despite performing as least as well as girls on math tests, and significantly better on science tests.”*

After fifth grade, he found, student assessment becomes a matter of *“a teacher’s subjective assessment of the student’s performance”*, and is further removed from the guidance of objective test results. Teachers, he says, tend to assess students on non-cognitive, *“socio-emotional skills.”*This has had a significant impact on boys’ later achievement because, while objective test scores are important, it is teacher-assigned grades that determine a child’s future with class placement, high school graduation and college admissibility.

Eliminating the factor of *“non-cognitive skills…almost eliminates the estimated gender gap in reading grades”*, Cornwell found. He said he found it *“surprising”* that although boys out-perform girls on math and science test scores, girls out-perform boys on teacher-assigned grades.

The report also found that:

* At primary level 85% of teachers are female. This has remained roughly the same since 2003.

In another study in the work place researchers asked supervisors to grade two poorly written essays and to provide feedback directly to each writer over chat, so that the writer could improve. At this point, the writers' names (Andrew or Sarah) were revealed, revealing that one was a man, the other a woman. Participants submitted a grade to each writer, as well as substantive comments to improve their essays.

Participants were more likely to tell white lies to the woman writer,  **inflating Sarah's grades nearly a full letter grade higher than from their initial private evaluation. They also gave her more positive comments than they gave Andrew. In contrast, the man's in-person feedback was statistically indistinguishable from the participants' undisclosed evaluations of his work.**

**Please note:** When this study was reported, it was reported as being discrimination towards women as their performance was being upgraded and they weret being given correct feedback, rather than the more obvious statement, that men are being disrimnated against and women work is being marked up.

Boys 'being held back by women teachers' as gender stereotypes are reinforced in the classroom

Do Schools discrimiante against boys: Dr. Jim Dueck, author, former Assistant Deputy Minister of Education for the province of Alberta, and former head of Accountability and Student Assessment, performed a revealing analysis on current practices in student assessment. The results were not only remarkable but very disturbing, exposing what might well be an institutional suppression of the performance of male students.

Related, despite a widely held view to the contrary, in a large scale national study, women are favoured 2:1 over IDENTICAL or even slightly more qualified men in STEM applicationss but gender BLIND helps men significantly, and the latter is now becoming less commonly applied as a result.

[https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360)

This could go to explain why many prominent claims of discrimination have failed as there is a perceived bias but on investigation, this is proved false e.g. US womens football team equal pay claim led to the judge saying the women were paid more than men, or women suing Google only for Googles results to show they were paying mens less.

Telegraph article on number of men in teaching, and techers openly admitting to sexism in favour of girls:

[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html)

I do know from my own direct experience that many young women of the 1960s and 1970s went into teaching inspired by a feminist mission to raise the self-esteem and the social position of girls. I could name at least half a dozen women teachers I knew personally in the later decades of the last century who were proud to say that they favoured girls in class to make up for the oppression of women in the past. The moral dubiety – and outright sexist prejudice - of inflicting second-class treatment on little boys who could bear no personal responsibility for those alleged (and profoundly questionable) historical crimes never seemed to trouble those apostles of equality. Men are hardly likely to become primary school teachers because they feel they owe a duty to their sex

By the same token, I can name a similar number of feminist commentators in the media/political establishment who celebrated the rise of educational attainments for girls in school as evidence that females are, by birth and nature, superior to males. As girls overtook boys in grades and exam results at all levels throughout the education system, those sisters were cock-a-hoop at their gender’s triumph – never acknowledging that the advantage of one sex must have been bought at the expense of the other. Not one Secretary of State for Education in the last 40 years has expressed concern that the [gender divide in academic achievement ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/11364130/Girls-do-better-than-boys-at-school-despite-inequality.html)reflected a worrying ethos in schools that imposed disadvantage and inequality on boys.

Previous submission got deleted by mod eventually so reposting here... still check it out as many excellent comments from men and women about their experience of this bias... many pointed out very obvious misandric comments from their teachers, some teachers even commented about their biases:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers\_mark\_girls\_higher\_for\_identical\_work\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers_mark_girls_higher_for_identical_work_to/)

This is an unpopular fact as it widely held in society that women and girls are discriminated against in education and in work, indeed in everything in life.

Note; below is general statement, countless awesome teachers but....

**Education is an example of institutional sexism. Now this data should to even feminist not be surprising... after all they call male majority and even female majority places as rife with sexism and ""male norms"" i.e. women have to act like men... is it any surprise then in teaching where 98% of early educators are female, 90% primary school teachers are female and these teachers have often studied gender studies type radical subjects at uni, and all HR and admin is female, that there is ""female norms"" being applied in education..... that the default child is a girl according to teachers? As the following data shows e.g. female teachers punishing boys for entirely normal behaviour that they dont understand; marking girls higher for IDENTICAL work, and giving higher predicted grades (despite boys objectively getting higher real life assesments) as they prefer girl students as model students and can relate to girl students better.... it is no wonder that schools are reducing play times, even removing physical education completely and replacing it with in class movement.... i.e. an entirely anti boy environment.... if 40% of boys are being drugged with aderal in some schools, do you think 40% of boys are unwell or maybe its the teachers who are shit and the system they made?**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Over then entire OECD countries globally, a large scale study showed that girls were given higher marks for IDENTICAL work to boys. OECD also showed that a boy receives 1/3 higher grade if the teacher does not know  he is a boy. Interestingly this gender gap goes away when it is a male teacher doing the marking.

Cornwell found that boys in all racial categories  are not  being *“commensurately graded by their teachers”* in any subject *“as their test scores would predict.”*

The  answer lies in the way teachers, who are statistically mostly  women,  evaluate students without reference to objective test scores.  Boys are regularly graded well below their actual academic performance.

Boys are falling significantly behind in grades, *“despite performing as least as well as girls on math tests, and significantly better on science tests.”*

After fifth grade, he found, student assessment becomes a matter of *“a teacher’s subjective assessment of the student’s performance”*,   and is further removed from the guidance of objective test results.   Teachers, he says, tend to assess students on non-cognitive, *“socio-emotional skills.”*   This has had a significant impact on boys’ later achievement because,   while objective test scores are important, it is teacher-assigned  grades  that determine a child’s future with class placement, high  school  graduation and college admissibility.

Eliminating the factor of *“non-cognitive skills…almost eliminates the estimated gender gap in reading grades”*, Cornwell found. He said he found it *“surprising”* that although boys out-perform girls on math and science test scores, girls out-perform boys on teacher-assigned grades.

The report also found that:

* At primary level 85% of teachers are female. This has remained roughly the same since 2003.
* At  secondary level the percentage of male teachers has fallen  steadily at  first and later precipitously from 40% in 2003 to 31.7% in  2012.

**It has been shown that boys and girls do better in reading when they have a same sex teacher. Just one year with a male teacher reduced the reading gap by 1/3 for 13 year old boys. It has als been shown:**
