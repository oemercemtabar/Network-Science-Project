**integralds**

So let's take a step back. Someone precisely define the GWG. We're all econs here, we can do this.

**commentsrus**

reg wage female, b_female < 0, p < 0.05

TADA

and then spend decades wondering why those results

**besttrousers**

Are there any proposed differences that aren't due to 1.) Endowments 2.) Preferences 3.) Discrimination?
or does that capture the sources

**commentsrus**

Endowments. Nice

**besttrousers**

hahaha

**gorbachev** 

btw, succinct definition of the GWG

""Whatever component of the difference between male and female wages that is unfair""

**integralds**

I'm not sure I can regress for ""unfair""

**Besttrousers**

eh

It's unfair that women have to go through labor and delivery

but that's not like society's problem

like get rid of discrimination, and you'd still see some GWG due to that

**reg_monkey**

I would say take an equal MPL woman and man and the man's wage - the woman's wage is the GWG

**commentsrus**

@besttrousers typical economist. unless (3) includes social pressure, you missed social pressure.  

and i mean social pressure beyond what shapes preferences

**reg_monkey**

Oh wait that isn't good because of choice variables

**besttrousers**

good point @commentsrus

**commentsrus**

obviously women can choose to do certain things

**integralds**

reg_monkey: I think that's close. Tack on the requisite expected discounted value stuff and I think it's really close. 

besttrousers' answer is also close.

**reg_monkey**

My problem is choice productivity variables like education.

Bad incentives might lead women to not get education

**gorbachev**

I'm joking w/ the definition, but the point = what we choose to care about in the difference between male and female wages is semi-secretly a normative decision

**commentsrus**

care? i just want to know all of the causes.

**integralds**

besttrousers, a wrinkle: should we think of preferences as exogenous for this question?

**ponderay**

But besttrousers isn't the whole debate around the GWG about how much discrimination matters?

**besttrousers**

Yeah @reg_monkey. Like it's [interesting in my GWG data mock-up](https://np.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/4ec0s6/the_silver_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/d204bpy/?context=4) how the wage gap due to discrimination is 20%, but the *realized* gap was like 25%

**commentsrus**

@ponderay i see a shift toward trying to figure out how much social pressure matters

**reg_monkey**

It's also very important for welfare considerations

GWG preventing capital accumulation is BAD

**integralds**

I mean I'm a macro person so I'm totally okay with taking preferences as exogenous, but I can conceive of reasons why we might not want to do that. Do more boys go into math because they have a pref for it, or are those prefs nudged by society/etc?

**besttrousers**

That's definitely a wrinkle @integralds - especially given @commentsrus point about social pressure

it is GOD DAMN impossible to find girls clothes that aren't pink

**commentsrus**

@ponderay e.g., why women take care of kids and do housework more. or go into less quantitative fields.
part is preferences, but those can shaped by social forces, and norms can also induce one to consciously choose something

Becker did some work on endogenous preferences but i know nothing

**besttrousers**

also even super dumb norms are stable with third party punishment. Bendor and Swistak 2000 show that any behavior is sustainable

**gorbachev**

dem folk theorems

**besttrousers**

@commentsrus there was a whole RSF working group on endogenous preferences in the 90s/00s

with Akerlof, Camerer, Fehr, Gintis etc.

**ponderay**

I guess when I'm thinking of discrimination I was lumping those sorts of things in.

**reg_monkey**

@integralds I think I got one definition I like. Take a man and woman with the same amount of TFP. Wage the man makes - wage the woman makes

**besttrousers**

still gotta measure some unobservables though

**commentsrus**

@besttrousers i totally know what RSF is...

**besttrousers**

russell sage foundation

**commentsrus**

this? https://muse.jhu.edu/book/38525

**besttrousers**

@commentsrus I think that's one of the products of the working group

working group used to have a webpage, but that was like a decade ago

**ponderay**

reg_monkey how the hell do you identify TFP then?

seems weird to just match residuals

**gorbachev**

reg_monkey, suppose they have the same MPL

or face the exact same wage setting function

suppose no taste discrimination occurs at any level

suppose women have lower MPLs due to child bearing

should we say there's a GWG?

**reg_monkey**

@ponderay I mean I don't think you can ID MPL either. I just wanted an ""innate potential"" to be the same

Ahh you're right gorby

**gorbachev**

(hashtag secretly normative. some will say no b/c paid same W given MPL, others will say is unfair to punish for child bearing even if it lowers MPL)

**mrdannyocean**

>also even super dumb norms are stable with third party punishment. Bendor and Swistak 2000 show that any behavior is sustainable

yeah this should be more well known game-theory wise

**besttrousers**

it's a neat finding!

**integralds**

I need to not write down DSGE models in chat.

**mrdannyocean**

too many econ types think 'everything will trend towards a nice efficient equilibrium over time' on every subject

but dumb norms are often sticky

nash equilibriums are just stable

Nothing makes them inherently efficient

**integralds**

I have in mind a multi-stage model involving education choice, job choice, and maternity leave; grind out the competitive equilibrium; there should be a way to define an ""excess"" GWG.

Then take it to data.

See, this is how macros think.

Micros would just hunt for exogenous or semi-exogenous variation and MHE their way to an estimate.

The average salary today is approximately $59,000. Again both numbers fluctuate a bit dependent upon the source but appear to be roughly accurate. 

So my question for those who are more well versed in economics than I: 

In 70 years, we saw the average worker's salary increase 18x from what it was in 1950. Therefore, 70 years from now, is it correct to assume that, while many different factors are at play and the economic conditions won't line up exactly, that the average worker salary could be in excess of $1 million?

I can't imagine a scenario where salaries are AVERAGING $1 million and the currency remains stable. At what point does the devaluation of the currency make a difference and could there be a point in the future where there will have to be a ""reset"" of sorts due to currency issues?",Skyab23,t2_2o1osu4p,0.76,604,321

(Do not counting Executives making XX mil $)

I have not seen this phenomenon almost anywhere elese, in the developed world. In Europe the wages are more evenly distributed, so there are no such low lows and not that high salaries.

237,16ho9oh,2023-09-13,AskEconomics,Wouldn’t it be beneficial for capitalism to provide equal opportunities for everyone?,"I know capitalism hasn’t been a relevant word for academic economists for a long time, so I am using that word for whatever the current economic system is, because it is largely based on free market principles. 

I am debating with a libertarian in my college / university. My professors will be watching our debate so I want to make sure my arguments hold weight. We had a pre debate discussion to get to know each other’s positions.

He argued against affirmative action (reservation in india), free education, universal health care, and anything which is related to gender and social equity. He said that government intervention in the free market hurts economic growth. His point is that, without government intervention, people will rise to the top based on their merits. He concluded that this system has been beneficial for the general public since Industrial Revolution because even tho free trade and free markets have increased inequality but on an average, the average Joe today is much better off than the average Joe before Industrial Revolution. He showed me a bunch of studies from reputed sources like imf, world bank, etc to back his claims.

While I agree with a lot of that, I disagree about the part where he said equal opportunities would hurt economic growth.

My argument is that there is systematic discrimination as well as bad luck is inhibiting people from reaching their full potential. So his system of meritocracy isn’t the most efficient way of recognising merit.

I pointed out that generally there is not much difference in cognitive / intellectual abilities between people of different genders, races, religions and sexuality. But there is systematic discrimination against these people which is inhibiting their potential. 

For example: Sexism, racism and queer phobia in office / work places leads to women, people of colour and queer people having less power, safety and respect in those places and thus leading them to quit the work place entirely, or if they stay, they have a hard time being themselves and showing their potential, network, and get their works and talents recognised. Thus, the current system of meritocracy is biased.

My argument is that reducing these systematic discrimination will help economic growth because these people will be more likely to work, there will be more people working on the next cancer cure, the next technological breakthrough, basically higher Innovation in general. And that will help improve the system of meritocracy. So it would be beneficial for the system that is generally defined as “capitalism” in this context, would benefit from reduction in that systematic discrimination.

Also free education and healthcare means people who otherwise could be very productive couldn’t afford education because of circumstances would lose out on so much potential economic growth. Similarly, someone got into an accident or has a mental health issue but can’t afford care, it’s inhibiting their productivity, thus it would be better for “capitalism” (TM) to provide these people with the care they need so they can get back to being more productive.

So I want to know if my arguments hold weight and my question is, wouldn’t it be beneficial for capitalism to provide equal opportunities (equity) for everyone?",AmaanMemon6786,t2_beq6r8cj,0.35,0,14

244,8dl7bg,2018-04-20,AskEconomics,Where Did Gender Pay Gap Come From?,"My friend Tong and I had an interesting discussion about the phenomenon of gender differences in social status. He proposes that the study of sociology has not discovered an convincing enough reason why the human society is male-dominant. 

The assumption to continue the discussion is that there is no statistical significance in the cognitive ability between man and women, but there are statistically significant physiological difference between the two gender. He brings up a good point that the concept of physical competence is multi-dimensioned, and we cannot simply claim that one gender is superior in physical ability to the other; for example, the typical male body has a larger muscle mass than the female body, but at the same time females generally have a higher pain tolerance than male and are more flexible. So why are females in a relatively disadvantageous position in the society compared to males?

I proposed that the majority of employment in the traditional industry (goods-producing, agriculture) are blue collar jobs, which involves in performing physical labor. Since the male body composition with more muscle mass than female gives them an advantage in carrying out these tasks, males are compensated more than females since they are generally more efficient in performing physical labor (doing more in a fixed amount of time). With the increase of automation and use of robots in manufacturing industries, we can see that the percentage of jobs that require physical labor is decreasing and at the same time the gender pay gap is decreasing as well.

However, we can see that the rate of change don’t quite correspond perfectly. In other words, goods-producing jobs are decreasing at the faster rate than the gender pay gap is decreasing. About 21% of goods-producing jobs disappeared in 2016 compared to 2006, but the gender pay gap only decreased for about 4.7% during that time. This means that while women are participating in the jobs that require mostly mental/cognitive capability, they are still compensated less than men.

Finance would arguably be a good example, since there is almost no physical labor involved in performing daily duties of finance. Success in the financial industry depends on abstract problem solving, analyzing patterns and critical thinking which are important aspects of cognitive ability, and female should be as competent as male. Looking at the above statistics, we can see that even though women make up a fairly large percentage of the workforce in finance (surpassing 50% in some branches), they becoming increasingly rare up the ranks. 

A similar case can be made about Asian people in Silicon Valley. While 47% of all Silicon Valley jobs are held by Asians, they only make up about 25% of the executives. Similar phenomenon exists in Wall Street. But this can be explained by the following: a lot of the Asian people who work in Silicon Valley/Wall Street are first or second generation immigrants, and it is definitely understandable that to make it to the top of the corporate ladder technical competence is only one aspect. The cultural differences which affects networking abilities and interpersonal skills could be used to explain the absence of Asian in executive positions, and as more second and third generation Asian enters the workforce with higher degree of assimilation into the US culture the number of Asian executives and managers has been increasing.

A significant difference between ethnic group comparison and gender comparison is the underlying distribution of resources. When a person of certain ethnic group attains a higher social status and thus gains control to more resources in the society, they would generally funnel the resources back to their own ethnic group. This can be done in a various of fashions, such as investment, charity, or simply by just having children. While when it comes to gender comparison, if a person of certain gender gains control to more resources, it is not certain that either of the gender group would benefit from those resources. Women or men usually find a partner who is of the opposite gender, and raise offsprings and share resources together as a family. This could explain why gender conflicts would never be as violent and unforgiving as ethnic conflicts, but it does not explain why one gender would hold the advantage in terms of social status to the other, as any individual of either gender groups still does have the same motivation to control as many resources as possible.

Many people have attributed female’s disadvantage to the patriarchal mentality, gender stereotypes, and traditional societal roles for either genders. While I agree that this is definitely one of the reasons that contribute to the phenomenon, it is unclear whether this is the only and most important one. As the human society becomes increasingly complex and competitive, persons and organizations who favor these gender stereotypes over efficiency and competence will gradually be eliminated, as evidenced by the increase of women in leadership roles in the last 30 years or so. And it does not explain why this mentality and stereotypes developed in the first place.

It shocked me. In America the medium salary is 60k/year and to be rich/earn a lot means a salary of six figures...
So I was shocked because in Italy the medium salary is 30k/year. But in reality in the south, where there is a lot of exploitation, 30k a year can only be a dream. In Italy we don't have a MINIMUN SALARY, and the recent legislative proposal of a minimun salary of 9€ per hour was REJECTED. (If I am not wrong in America the medium salary per hour is 30$). Here a lot of families survive off a salary of 1500€ a month. Here for a 16/17/18 years old it's not normal to work, because you can even be paid 25/30€ a day for 12 hours of work. And there is no tip culture.
How can we explain such differences in salarys? 
The € and the $ are almost the same in value, health care can cost a lot in the US, but alone cannot justify this difference. The other main difference is the education system, that in the US COSTS A LOT, here in Italy, in a public university, the fees can hardly reach 4k/year. But the cost of life isn't pretty much the same? (At least for what I know, and what I ve seen of social medias).
AMERICANS please explain to me, how do you spend your money, and how a person with 60k a year is not rich, but normal.
Also Americans say that its impossible for them to buy a house, if I am well informed you spend at least 400k for a house but its also common to spend 1million or more in bigger cities. Here normal people spend around 200k or 300k maximum. But in reality American houses cost so much because they are HUGE, they have at least 2 floors, a backyard, a garage etc. Here you spend 200/300k for a fucking flat. If you compare prices for m² in Italy it's around 2000€/m². In the US the medium price is around 1600$/m².

But that all changed when the Japanese bombers attacked. While men fought on the frontlines in WWII, it was the Rosie the Riveters back home who filled the labor gap, making the bombs, airplanes, and other industrial products fueling both the war effort and home life. Over six million women entered the workforce by the end of World War II, and by 1945, they made up almost 37 percent of the workforce. By the early 1990s, the labor force participation rate of prime working-age women—those between the ages of 25 and 54—reached just over 74 percent, compared with roughly 93 percent for prime working-age men.

As women increased their education and joined industries and occupations formerly dominated by men, the gap in earnings between women and men began to close significantly. The rise in women's labor force participation dramatically increased the labor supply causing wages to stagnate in America. Over the entire 34-year period between 1979 and 2013, the hourly wages of middle-wage workers were stagnant, rising just 6 percent—less than 0.2 percent per year. This wage growth, in fact, occurred only because wages grew in the late 1990s when labor markets got tight enough—unemployment, for instance, fell to 4 percent in 1999 and 2000—to finally deliver across-the-board hourly wage growth. The wages of middle-wage workers were totally flat or in decline over the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, except for the late 1990s. The wages of low-wage workers fared even worse, falling 5 percent from 1979 to 2013.

Workers received lower pay in occupations with a higher share of female workers. A study found that [a 10 percentage-point increase in the female share of an occupation's workforce leads to an 7% decline in average female wage, and a 7.7% decline in average male wage, measured contemporaneously.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927537121001378#:~:text=I%20estimate%20that%20a%2010,average%20male%20wage%2C%20measured%20contemporaneously)

Today, we live in a society where both parents must work to support a family. Gone are the days when one income could support a family. So did wages really stagnate when women joined the workforce?",Alarmed_Pilot_5802,t2_lex7yjud,0.86,43,4

I was recently discussing the gender pay gap with a friend of mine (guy) who recently became a feminist. He's a smart guy, but he and I don't see eye to eye on this issue. (Shocker!)

Now. obviously the gender pay gap is over exaggerated by most liberals, as it fits their agenda, but it seems clear to most rational individuals that a large portion of the pay gap can be accounted for by decisions made by laborers.

Some models state that the adjusted pay gap is 7.1%; however, models that attempt to account for the cost of fringe benefits as a total compensation produce an adjusted pay gap of 3.6%, and I am under the school of thought that this figure is accurate.

However, it is the 3.6% pay gap that concerns me. However, some sources say that this 3.6% is something not to worry about. Others say that it is overt discrimination. 

It seems obvious to me that men and women are perfect substitutes in the labor market. So if women were getting paid ANY amount lower than men, all else held constant, women would always be preferred over men. It stands to reason then that there is some way to account for this 3.6%, but as there is no model to address this earnings gap, it still concerns me.

1) New Ideas/Cross Pollination is sufficiently valuable as to create a premium on hiring outside employees. 


2) Searching for talent internally is naturally more difficult than searching externally, because external hires force people to polish up their resume, give interviews, etc.


3) Some psychological barrier makes it easier to hire someone new than internally promote (similar to the explanation about the relative use of layoffs vs pay cuts)

290,aw7h04,2019-03-01,AskEconomics,Why does geographical pay disparity exist in MNCs?,"Why are different employees in the same firm, same role across geographies paid different wages?

This is most visible in FANG tech roles - pay disparity exists for the same role with the same expectations across geographies. Job roles, their requirements and expectations are standardised across the organisation.

I can understand that these different geographies are effectively separate labour markets and therefore labour supplies are decoupled.

If a company hires someone at city X even when employees(of the same skills) are available for cheaper at city Y this implies that labour demand is also decoupled.

Is there any data on the causes of such a large differential, to the tune of 6-7x for entry level tech roles?

The gap seems narrower at higher paid roles.

(My hypothesis for the above is - as living costs become a smaller fraction of income, CoL becomes a less weighted factor helping labour supply to become coupled. However CoL is not the only cause behind weakly coupled labour supplies - Dublin salaries are higher than London for some reason.)

Two different explanations I can think of for the pay disparity

1. Returns to local scale - there are productivity gains from people even across multiple teams/orgs sharing the same physical space(networking events, cross team/org communication, easier re-orgs) and therefore it's possible for there to be differing productivity gains to a firm for similar people joining different offices.

2. MNCs use their market power in low pay markets to suppress wage/enact wage discrimination(what's a good term for an analogue of price discrimination?) in these markets.

Empirical support for 1 would be higher disparities between locations with large and small offices. This does not seem to explain the pay disparities among offices of, say Amazon at Bangalore/Hyderabad vs several smaller centres in US and Europe.

Empirical support for 2 would be higher disparity in firms which employ a more sizeable chunk of the talent at low pay locations. However I am not aware of any companies that have a tiny footprint at 'low pay' geographies(and therefore no market power and hence motive to wage discriminate) and no disparity.

Also, salary levels for any job role across cities seem to follow the same order for FANG regardless of sizes of their offices at various cities which vary widely, which defies both 1 and 2.

In popular media and on the global stage, we encounter stereotypes about Americans, which may, in part, result from their economic strength, ranging from misconceptions about their education to notions of excessive patriotism and a reliance on firearms to solve problems.  
  
The United States, throughout its history, has wielded tremendous economic power, marked by groundbreaking innovations and contributions to science and technology. Its global influence extends to diplomacy, trade, and cultural exchange, largely driven by its economic might.  
  
This intriguing paradox prompts the question: How can a nation, often stereotyped as lacking in certain educational and intellectual aspects, simultaneously hold a position as one of the most powerful, innovative, and influential countries globally, largely because of its economic achievements?  
  
I recognize that beyond historical opportunities (like the 18th century when Europe grappled with religious conflicts, colonialism, and nationalism), America attracted educated individuals seeking a better life, possessed vast economic resources, had weak neighbors, a unified culture, language, and society, and introduced the world's first capitalist democracy, reaping numerous economic benefits.  
  
The solution I've found is that even if the average American isn't perceived as exceptionally intelligent or a model citizen, their economic contributions are a fundamental part of their culture. The United States pioneered capitalism and wholeheartedly embraced it like no other nation in history, which has been a significant driver of its success.",Fijoza,t2_v1onpuq9,0.81,47,67
296,15ub28a,2023-08-18,AskEconomics,Economics of local currencies in isolation. Can isolated country save money?,"I have an interesting question (at least I think so), but it's kind of difficult to even explain...

So, imagine that some country existed in isolation from the rest of the world. It's completely self sufficient, developed economy, all is great, etc. But since it's completely isolated - there is no currency exchange with other countries, so the value of the currency can only be measured in tangible assets rather than how it's normally done by looking at the exchange rate. It also prevents it from accumulating foreign reserves and assets which can be used to boost its economy using the ""outside world"" without affecting local economy.

From my understanding, if the said isolated country decides to save money for ""rainy day"" it would just create deflationary pressure beyond certain threshold, since it's taking currency from the economy, but if it decides to spend its currency it would do the opposite - drive the inflation (which might be offset by increased economic output, etc., but still).

So, the question is - what can such a country even do to ""save money for later"" without interacting with other countries? I don't see any way to do that other than making its ""savings"" in tangible productive assets (e.g. natural resources).",Lurlerrr,t2_qh1an,1.0,3,6

TL;DR He makes two contradictory assumptions about the detriment function d for each group. First (A1) he assumes that d is a constant, initially across all firms, and then later within a given firm even when its size changes. Second (A2) he assumes that total detriment is a function only of the *proportion* of W/B employees within each firm, which, it turns out, implies variable d. As a result his whole argument collapses and is invalid.

Arrow separates the wage paid into a $ cost (w or wage) and a utility cost (d or detriment), both indexed by the two groups under consideration  ""W"" and ""B"".

(1) Profit (pi) is pi = f(W+B) - w(subW)W - w(sub B)B

The distaste for employees of a given group is d(sub W or B), the negative of the marginal rate of substitution of profits for W or B labor. [edit clarify]

From this he derives, assuming d is constant within a given firm, 

(4) w(sub W) - W(Sub B) = d(sub B) - d(sub W) > 0, 

if we assume that the detriment for B is larger than for W.

Now, assuming all firms have the same utility function, he derives 

(7)  d(sub W)W + d(sub B)B = 0

So employers lose nothing from discrimination and the only effect is a transfer from B to W employees. [edit fix]

The sketched proof of (7) depends on an assessment of the effect on the firm of a change in the number of employees, with the ratio kept fixed, given assumption A2 that the utility effect of employee composition depends only on the ratios of W and B.

Now he relaxes the assumption that all firms have the same utility function, but still requiring that all firms have a utility function that (apart from profit) depends only on the ratio of W and B employees.

From this, with the additional assumption A3 that the firms all have a mix of W and B employees, he derives an expression for the ratio of W and B employees in each firm, [edit typo]

W/L = d(sub B)/(w(sub B) - w(sub W)) = - d(sub W)/(w(sub W) - w(sub B)) [edit fix]

I will explain in a comment in detail why this is wrong, according to me.

I'm trying to analyze this strictly from an economics point of view, not from a social or opinionated standpoint.

I see two scenarios:

A: Males earn X (total economic payout) money, factories produce Y amount of product, female average free time = Z. Product production satisfies consumer population, livable conditions.

B: Males earn X/2 money, females earn X/2 money, factory now produces Y+ amount of product from added female population, average female free time = Z- working hours. Product production grows, prices drop across the board as demand decreases, single males and females have reduced buying power due to salary reduction.

Now the question: Is there some accurate way to measure the amount of free time that women have given up in relation to the percentage price drop in consumer goods and reduction of male salaries? How does this affect single earners in our economy, and their ability to survive? Does it force more people to enter the workforce than in the past?

303,k4ql6l,2020-12-01,AskEconomics,Do economists have a confirmation bias?,"Hi everyone, a econ major here. I'd like to share a little reflection I have been developing the last weeks

As I take deeper courses of macro and micro I see a trend in the way that economics are taught around the world. We start from hiper-simplified models with assumptions that don't resemble reality to make these conceptual frameworks easier to learn right? Then as you take more advanced courses we incorporate more variables to the models with mathematical tools so they can be more exact. 

Why does this happens? Because econ is a social science and we can't have the degree of accuracy that natural sciences like physics, why? because our subject of study (humans) and the related variables can't be controlled or tested. (I guess you'll all agree with this)

Now, I think in the academia and the people in high positions of economic policymaking there's a confirmation bias in terms of confronting our models with reality. Every time that a major crisis occurs there's a heavy review in the mainstream economics theories that dominated the field. This seems to be a natural issue in the history of any science as when something is proven false we should move towards other foundations, but of course it's quite hard in our field as we can't ""prove"" statements as other sciences do.

I feel like there's a strong confirmation bias among influential economists as we try to make the reality more like the model and not the opposite (which is what you would expect in other science).

If you agree with the last statement then what are the causes? I will try to propose one:  


It's a very well known fact that many of the students that enter graduate programs of econ come from non-economics backgrounds, such as math, physics, statistics, engineering, etc. These people in their backgrounds studied hard science where they have an exact degree of accuracy in predictions and can test the variables that influence the phenomenons. Ofc that isn't the case in econ, but they keep the same mindset. Then you have them in high positions in academia, central banking, international organizations or government and they think they understand situations that we simply can't (and again, that's why there are reviews of mainstream economics every time we have a crisis and why there's this ridiculized conception that economist always fail when predicting anything).

Finally, if my explanation is correct, what are the political implications of this? I think that it might be that we should move towards higher degrees of economic freedom as the intervention decisions that economists do are made without the proper information and therefore distorsionate market equilibriums.

What do you think? I'm wrong? why?",aNu2001,t2_46pdlryn,0.91,85,32

&#x200B;

In my mind this has several positives.  It pushes back against the scenario of CEO's gutting everyones pay and union busting or driving into bankruptcy and then taking a golden parachute and walking away.  Because there max would decrease if they lower everyone else's pay.

&#x200B;

It also incentivizes growing wages for the entire company.  (which I suppose you could argue is inflationary for everyone).

I'm also curious if the platform serves as a good example of wealth redistribution among those on the platform.

There is a chapter (16, I believe) about capitalism where he describes it as a system where businesses reinvest profits today because of the belief in generating wealth in the future from that investment. It was the first time I had heard capitalism described as a system of reinvestment (as opposed to how I usually think of it, which is making a profit based on a free or fair market). 

The idea got me thinking about structural ways that governments could change tax code to balance out wealth disparities. Specifically, if equipment can be capitalized and depreciated, why couldn't employees' salaries and wages (up to a maximum threshold: for example, up to $75000 in 2023) be capitalized and then also depreciated. In my thinking, wages and salary are investment in it's employees' productivity, so why not give businesses a financial benefit of depreciating the cost as a capital expense (I.e. reducing it's tax basis). This also would seemingly incentivize business to pay it's employees up to the maximum threshold and potentially lower the risks of hiring more workers when there is a need.

This post is me spitballing but I'd be curious to hear others thoughts on the merits, oversights or weaknesses this idea. If you know if any economics papers covering this idea, I'd definitely like to check them out if you share. I didn't find anything of note when I googled topics like ""depreciating salary costs"".

Edit to add: I know that typically depreciation is a decrease in an asset's value from the balance sheet and that decrease reflected on the income statement. In this scenario, I guess that balance of offsetting accounts wouldn't work (at least with existing rules).",Noshoesded,t2_3miavl2n,0.86,5,11

Szenario 1 - The hero mother

Imagine a wife and a husband work together in the same job at the same level, earning equal pay. The wife then gives birth and takes four years off work to raise her child.

When she returns to work her husband has progressed in the meantime. He has been promoted to a senior position and earns 20% more than she does. They no longer have equal pay - the woman has been peanlized for motherhood, the father has been financialy rewarded for more relevant work experience.

Szenario 2 - Shared responsibilities

Imagine now that the mother resumes work after two years and that the father takes care full time of the child for another two years. On their child's fourth birthday the father resumes work. Both have been peanlized for child rearing as both have lost two years of relevant work experience. However, both end up with the same salary.

Szenario 3 - Subsidized parenting

On the one hand it feels like rent-seeking behavior that isn’t socially optimal, especially given that some people have bots to immediately buy up stock as soon as it’s available, such that the average person has a slim chance of being able to buy the good at its “normal” price. So what could possibly be the value added to society of this type of behavior?

The other hand is that scalpers act as a distributing agent almost like a form of price discrimination. Those with the highest willingness to pay on average may be those who get the most utility out of the good, thus scalping gets the product to those who will benefit most from it, though consumer surplus would be minimized if price discrimination is perfect.

350,yu3gb6,2022-11-13,AskEconomics,"Pegouvian exploitation, the weaponisation of prices, LTV and marginal utility","I saw a recent post here asking about marginal utility and I wanted to ask this in return. 

Capitalists like to say workers aren't exploited because labor doesn't determine value. 

But there's this YouTube video I watched:
https://youtu.be/IzE_Xurt588

Where he explained why even without objective labor theory of value and even with marginal utility workers are still exploited. 

He argues that labor is the essential catalytic factor in turning a raw ingredients into an assembled product and is responsible for the subtraction or addition of any subjective determined value that results from production.

So even if we say a car that increases value overtime without any additional labor the value's increase still depends on the laborers creation of the car in the first place. A car can't increase in value if the workers didn't create the car in the first place. 

Pigouvian exploitation:
Price discrimination - selling something at different prices to different demographics

Monopsony- a monopoly in purchase and consumption

So because the worker is forced into participating in the expropriation of labor the company the worker is working for can determine the price of his labor low to the capitalists benefit. But the capitalists can change that value of labor in the production process when selling them to consumers with a higher valuation. They often using fetish cultivation tactics like spectacle and destajce or playing into marginal utility and supply and demand.

So the capitalists can play market forces to their benefit to maximize their earnings at the exploitative expense of worker and consumer. If we cut out the middleman (Capitalists) and the expriopriation of labor and have the workers control the means of production and therefore the fruits of their labor they would be better off.

In today's society capitalists can us etheirbwelath, power, and Monopsony to accumulate wealth without doing anything productive. And what they can do the workers can just do it themselves if they had controled the capital in the first place which is excluded from them by the institution of private property. 

He even says that ""austrian schools and capitalist apologists including Keynesians love to use the weaponization of price discrimination as a supposed justification for capitalist exploitation""

This ability to perform price descrimiation, fetishization, and exploitation allows capitalists to exacerbate feedback loops of accumulation and stratification which produces more inequality.

My basic argument is that with more money at your disposal consumers will be encouraged to spend more, driving prices up even more. Considering that inflation is strongly tied to monetary supply and global supply chains (e.g. oil and gas prices), it looks to me that giving employees more money (unclear where they would come from), can only motivate companies to increase prices to make up for the extra spend, therefore leading to a decrease of purchasing power, which is the opposite of the intended effect.

For example, the sunk cost fallacy might make sense in a scenario with incomplete information where reputation matters, as, if you don't abandon it, you could still try to sell the project as a success, because others don't have the information to determine it was actually a poor investment, whereas abandoning the project just gives you a loss on your record and it is difficult for others to see it was actually a prudent decision. Or you could explain loss aversion by assuming people choose to hold money (instead of buying things or investing) only to cover some relatively predictable future expenses and no more than required for that purpose. That way, it would make sense to gamble to avoid even quite small losses, as they come with the large added cost, independent of how large they are, of having to sell something/pull out of your investment to come up with the needed money.

But another [study](https://hbr.org/2018/01/when-more-women-join-the-workforce-wages-rise-including-for-men) suggests the opposite 

I’ve read a lot of acemoglu and he doesn’t seem like the Jordan Petersen type to suggest that in order to address this women should leave the workforce because they’re dragging down men’s wages- so is he really suggesting a direct correlation like that or is it more complex

369,18ng4fi,2023-12-21,AskEconomics,Is the Job Market Really this Bad?,"Hey guys, looking for some serious advice on what to do. I currently feel very lost in life and there's really nobody I can speak to besides those on the internet.   
Some background, I graduated as an Economics Major from a Top 10 University in California (Top 30 National), and have been unable to find a job for the past 3 months. I graduated with a 3.4 GPA, and worked all 4 years of college. I didn't do any internships because I was working full time and going to school, but is that what is really killing me right now? The lack of internship was only brought up in one of my interviews, to which I explained how I worked mostly to fund my whole education, to which they were very understanding. 

  
I have had my resume revised and am currently using the best iteration of it. I have applied to over 200 jobs, and out of that 200ish, I have had about 15 interviews. Only 2 of those 15 did I not make it past the first round, and the rest I made it into the second/final rounds, but was never selected. The closest I came to receiving an offer, they told me I was pretty much going to get the job, I reach out a few days later after hearing nothing, and then they tell me the Department Lead was told by the company to no longer fill any more open positions (and this company is a VERY big name, everyone knows it- respectfully not going to name drop ofc). That was the most soul crushing experience I've had recently, and it really killed a lot of my motivation to move forward. The jobs I've been applying for have been so entry level, I sometimes tell myself I might as well just go work at McDonald's at this point. Even for the majority of the in-person interviews I've gone to where there was a waiting room, I've 10 times out of 10 have been the youngest person in the room, and I still always give it my best during the interview, but still always have the gut feeling that I'm not going to get the position just going by seniority. 

  
So after 3 months of dealing with all this and feeling like I've gone close to nowhere with my life since graduating, what are my options or what is something I can do in the meantime? In terms of skills, I've been mastering Excel and self teaching myself how to use SAP as most of these jobs I'm applying to require some knowledge or experience of that. I go to the gym 5 days a week, and that is currently the only enjoyment I feel I have in my life right now. I don't currently have a job because I am putting my full effort into doing these Zoom interviews throughout the week and driving to various cities for in-person interviews as well. I tried my absolute best these past 3 months to stay optimistic and keep trying and to never give up, but all these rejections have really started taking a toll on me mentally, to where I realized that I'm now applying to less and less jobs everyday as I've become subconsciously unmotivated. It just sucks because I really enjoy working, considering I did it throughout my years in college and enjoyed it. I'm obviously very eager to work, it just upsets me that there's no opportunities despite me trying my absolute best. 

  
I'm just really lost and don't know how to move forward, I feel as if I'm stuck. I don't really have anybody I can speak to about this in real life. The only suggestion I've been given is to go to get my Masters degree or an MBA, but I don't know if I'm quite ready for that yet. Upon graduating, I was really excited to find a career where I can grow and that aligned with everything I went to school for, but I just don't know anymore.

They give a few examples from social psychology and sociology where it seems to have negative effects on the quality of scholarship.

[This paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691620924463) looks at replication attempts of just under 200 studies in psychology, and finds that, regardless of which side's worldview they seem to support, they replicate with equal frequency. This suggests that political leanings may not affect the outcome of science.

But I wonder if this is just because of the relatively low D:R ratio in psychology. Is it possible that in some fields, like gender studies or [Christian apologetics](https://www.liberty.edu/residential/divinity/masters/christian-apologetics/), where the ratio of people with one ideology to another is high, it could start to seep in again?

Are there more subtle ways where political opinions could make their way into the research?

I am about to graduate with my BS in economics. I knew for a long time I wanted to go to graduate school, but before my senior year began, I decided I would work first, mostly because I have no debt out of my undergrad but would need to take out loans for grad school. I figured if I saved money beforehand it would make the process easier. 

About a month ago, still with no job prospects, I decided to apply to the MA program at my current institution. I have developed connections throughout my undergrad at the school, and was able to get a GRE waiver. I figured why not. 

I have been accepted and offered some scholarship money. I may have to take out some loans still, but relatives are also willing to help me out. All in all, it should not be too expensive. 

Should I go or work first? I really want to continue to study economics. That's why I want to go. But, the more research I do on the salary expectation, it seems like it's unreasonable to expect much more than 60k for starters.

-----------------------------------
Workers must work 2.5 times harder, for only 1.3 times as much money, while prices are 3.5 times higher than they were in 1975.

So, let's do the math...

The average worker is working 2.584 times harder for (128.5/356.49) = 36.05% of the effective income their counterpart would've made in 1979.

If we divide the change in effective income a worker gets by the change in the amount of work they have to do for it, the average job is (0.3605 / 2.584) = 13.95% as valuable as its counterpart in 1979.

I don't understand economics much. But I have a concerning question. As somewhat obvious (I guess), most western European socialist countries (obviously not including Nordic countries like Norway, etc) are doing well; e.g. Germany and The Netherlands. My question is what does the economic future of these countries look like?  

The political climate of the world is at a tension now. A person - who I think somewhat understood economics - said something about socialist countries. He said that the way that these economies are dealing with outsiders, specifically taking care of anyone who can enter the country, these economies will collapse; or at least worsen tremendously. He said for example that The Netherlands is giving unemployment services to anyone without any kind of discrimination, which is absurd because there are jobs that pay less than that. Unfortunately he didn't go into much detail.  

This made me curious and somewhat scared. I live in a developing country and I'm considering immigration with something like a skilled worker visa. Pinpointing my values, I arrived at the conclusion that culturally my high preference for the country of destination is The Netherlands.

I reviewed the last jobs report of August, and I was wondering how it is possible that there is an increase in Nonfarm Payroll and an increase in the Unemployment rate.

Nonnfarm payroll increase means that more people (excluding farms jobs) have gotten jobs and started to work.
Unemployment rate increase means that more people that are unemployed are now seeking for a job.

The confusing part is, if more people are working now (Nonfarm payroll has increased), how is it possible that unemployment rate increased too?
I can only think about a situation in which more unemployed people that HAVE NOT been seeking for a job, are now in the hunt for a new job.

In the US, there is a massive stigma and even retaliation for revealing salary information (an old company I was with was becoming a JV partner with another company and they said we weren’t allowed to share personal compensation information at the risk of being fired). 

My professor said that if we made worker compensation information public, it would also reduce information asymmetry and allow for pay to become subject to a more free market dynamic, which would transfer power and wealth to the workers and increase compensation. 

He personally thought all compensation should be made public and that would help overall worker compensation to increase relative to today.

Also, it is not a winner take all industry, the way, say, social media or entertainment is. To that end, why are investment banks and hedge funds able to maintain such high margins and salaries that aren’t present in other fields? 

Oddly, in spite of there being orders of magnitudes more hedge funds now than in 1980, there is very little in the way of price competition. The 2 and 20 compensation model has remained the standard in spite of middling performance from most funds. How is the sector able to get away with this when other sectors are not? For example, structural engineers aren’t able able to charge 2% of a buildings construction cost annually in perpetuity as long as it doesn’t fall down because there are other firms that will work for $150/man hour with no residuals. Why hasn’t this happened in finance?

However, on the other hand, unlike hedge funds, there seem to be essentially no startup investment banks. If you look at the top investment banks, basically none were founded recently (mergers excluded).

416,my58pr,2021-04-25,AskEconomics,How do salaries compare between countries,"I'm struggling to understand how to understand the salary differences between countries. Primarily my country (The Netherlands) and the United States. What I mean by understanding the differences is how quality of life, buying power and exchange rates play into the differences.   


I'll explain.  
I im an engineer currently out of university and my salary is about 40k a year all bonuses included. Its about 2300 a month after taxes which means I pay about 25% in income taxes. However, due to the changing taxes as you make more I pay about 50% income tax over all the extra salary that I make when I get a raise. I read that in some places in the US a starting salary of an engineer can be around 70k to 100k. Now obviously the currencies are different but the exchange rates aren't that much different, that 100k would be about 83k here. 

Now I do know that you pay more in health care but still, I don't see how that salary is incredibly high. Especially given the fact that products like electronics are almost the exact same amount. But over your monthly salary that same laptop is very cheap. 

I know very little about economics but I can imagine that your salary is not a measure of how much 'money' you have to spend but rather the amount of money you have each month minus your monthly expenses. If I do that I have, of that 2300 dollars about 1000 dollars left to save for things I want to buy and also pay of extra luxury. However, if people in the US make 80k a year, I can imagine that the amount of money you have left to spend each month is so much more than here in the Netherlands, yet I hear people say that a 80k salary 'isn't that high'. 80k in the Netherlands is an insanely high salary and something you can 'maybe' expect if you are a true expert in your field and over 40 or 50 years old. Its what a surgeon might make if they are at the top of their fields. If I do the math, 80.000 a year is about 4200 a month after taxes. that's roughly twice what I make. As I meantioned though, products in your country are about the same price, so relative to your salary, id say everything is super cheap there. Also, gasoline seems much cheaper, its 0,70 EUR yet I pay 1.60 EUR, more than twice as much.

Is it that health care and rent it so expensive that in the US a person pays so much more that their 'Free income' is about the same? Because if I assume that every dollar that you earn is about half as much, I would say that that would give a huge friction if you compare that to the exchange rate.

I find it hard to verbalise what im struggling to understand. So let me put it in another context. Lets say someone with the exact same job as me is making $80k a year. So I go to my manager and I tell him I want to make 80k as well (or whatever would be the equivalent in my currency) because I can get that salary in another country where products are equally as expensive. What would he argue where he have a perfect understanding of economics? Is it that he would say that even though you make more in the US, the cost of living are so much higher that your free income (after rent, electricity, healthcare) is the same? If that where true, if both of us would get a 4% raise, that raise would be worth much more because over your 80k salary because that 4% yields much more 'extra' money with a US salary even though nothing changes in your monthly expenses.

I am currently a 20 year old student in the US and I am wanting to pursue a masters degree. I was wondering whether a supply chain or economics degree would be better? I know economics master degree holders have crazy income potential however supply chain jobs are expected to grow at a 30% rate and the masters program offered at my school had mentioned they have a 100% job placement rate before they even graduate (not within a year like most schools advertise) and not a single student had a job offer below a 70k salary and some had as high as 84-87k starting salaries.

This is more a general question on your opinions. What effects do you believe automation would have on the labor force? Whether driverless cars making most taxis drivers redundant or digital assistance at hotel receptions for checking in and everything else.

Intuition would say it would reduce the demand of labor, thus increasing involuntary unemployment. This of course lacks a lot of depth, so I would be happy to hear what your views or opinions are on this topic in the coming decades.

For example, many advances economies have the aging demographics problem (such as Germany and Japan, but USA also). This causes issues with the economic growth of the countries. Would automation assist in softening this problem, as there would be less labor demand (for jobs that could be automated), meaning there is less labor demand as a whole in the economy, and the employees whose jobs have been replaced will fill missing employment in other jobs and sectors.

With higher efficiencies, do you see prices decline and inflation picking up? How do you think economic policy (monetary and fiscal) would react to future scenarios?

422,16vtvgy,2023-09-30,AskEconomics,Why do people say an individual flat income tax won't work in Americans? Why do further people advocate for multi millionaires to pay a fair share when they the ones who grow and expand the job market for the most part?," I was not born in America. I did not take a formal economics class in my secondary education as I am a now a D.V.M.

 Why cant everyone pay a 20% flat tax on all sources of income from earned wages to stock dividends and inherited assets? 

If those billionaires and multi-millionaires  taxed on everything from earned income to their stock trading gains which could equal hundreds of billions of dollars why isn't this fair to the people who could only afford to pay the 20% of their earned income from their vocations?

there are 3 categories; million/billionaires, skilled workers, and working poor to generalize this scenario. 

For easy math purposes lets say there are 150 million people who work in America of a country of 300 million.

 There are about 30  million multimillionaires.( I actually googled this to get this number). I further googled those in the 1% in income but are not multi-millionaires. That is another 20 million Americans. So for simple math purposes one third  of the working population (50 million people) is a well off or a multimillionaire based on the google searches of stated income demographics.  

&#x200B;

So if the top 3rd of workers is taxed at 20%. just say they make an even 1 million a year to account for the 1% and billionaires together. 1 mil taxed at 20% is 200k a year in taxable income per taxable. 200 thousand x 50 million is 10 trillion dollars! 

&#x200B;

Let's just say another 3rd of the working population is the working poor making 25K a year. After tax they would get about 20k to live off of which is still doable. ( I lived on 18K a year with a wife when we were both in professional school) Put all that to get her and you get 250 billion dollars. 

&#x200B;

Then there are the people in between lets just say two working skilled workers make 150K a year. Their 20% would be 30k. 30K x 50 million equals about 1.5 trillion dollars a year in tax revenue. 

&#x200B;

The argument that the middle class would subsidize the lower class does not add up. AS the upper third is paying 10 trillion in tax. 

&#x200B;

When we add all the income groups together, we get about 12 trillion dollars! 

&#x200B;

the US government is at 6 trillion now. Wouldn't we have a surplus of funding then to expand social programs and provide universal healthcare?

437,x81lyv,2022-09-07,AskEconomics,Does a strong job market always mean that the economy is in good shape?,"In recent times, the job market in US has been really strong. But as far as I understand, this is due to a combination of factors that has led to increased consumer spending and labour shortage, which in turn has resulted in a strong job market. Economic stimulus from the government and increased household saving during the pandemic meant that consumers have a lot of money to spend. On the other hand, retiring baby boomers as well as declining immigration in last 5 years have caused a labour shortage which has lead to higher salaries. But if this is true, then it doesn't look like a good sign to me in the long term. With an aging population and declining birth rate, unless immigration goes back to pre 2016 levels, the consumer spending will drop in the long run. So, I feel like the current job market is due to factors that are not really good in the long term.

But she's also incredibly risk-averse. Very picky eater, doesn't like leaving her comfort zone more than absolutely required, etc.

So money can be a sticking point for us at times. Because of a death in the family, she came into a chunk of money, and it's been sitting in her savings account (0.3% interest rate) for almost 2 years at this point. I want her to invest the money - at least in like bonds or something. But every time I suggest it, she gets really antsy and says something along the lines of ""but isn't it like gambling? we could lose it all.""

444,fnio5i,2020-03-23,AskEconomics,"Wouldn't it be cheaper/more efficient to pay people, rather than bail out companies?","What I'm reading is that we need to bail out companies in order to maintain jobs. Wouldn't it be far more efficient just to pay a UBI-type thing? (Note: I'm not advocating UBI *per se*, rather as a stop-gap in the current crisis.)

Arguments/my reasoning:

* If businesses are failing because no one is using them (e.g. air travel), then they are going to continue to need bailouts. Thinking bailouts are a one-time thing vs. ongoing UBI-type payments is unrealistic.

* We've already seen companies using the cash to buy back stock.  OK, we can put in legislation to stop that, but paying people would be far more efficient.

* Giving working people money maintains money flow - working people buy necessities, rather than investments.

* Medium/long-term, we would realise either a) we don't need this/that industry or b) this industry needs to be more efficient.  It would provide a huge opportunity for innovation and entrepreneurship as people try to fill the vacuum left by collapsed companies.

1. Advanced Microeconomics:

Reference text is Microeconomic Analysis by Varian

We will only focus on Consumer Choice (preferences, utility and the utility maximization problem), Expected Utility Theory,  General Equilibrium and Game Theory.

It is mainly aimed towards those who want to do an MSc in Economics. I am unclear if it will have any usefulness in public/private sector roles that involve economic analysis.   
2. Applied Economic Policy Evaluation

Looks at the use of RCTs, experimental economics, simple game theory models and a few other tools that are used in policy evaluation. It takes a case study approach. We look at policy examples in pollution control, taxation, reducing pupil/teacher absenteeism, international climate agreements and the democratic process.   
3. Experimental Economics

Reference Text is Markets, Games and Strategic Interaction

It aims to introduce the methods of experimental economics and its uses in different areas of economics. It looks at experimental markets and price discovery, individual decision making (Baye's rule, information cascade, statistical discrimination), signalling games and prediction markets. 

For context: I am in my final year of an Economics degree. I plan to go straight into work or to take a masters in data science/statistics.

So think jock and nerd stereotypes (Revenge of the Nerds, etc) or anything that might make you think of high school. it's open to interpretation.

I'm going as a sort of S&M schoolteacher. If you do an image search for 'sexy schoolteacher' you'll get the general idea of what I'm going for. As part of the costume, I'm bringing with me a [wood paddle](https://www.michaels.com/product/unfinished-wood-paddle-by-make-market-10390319?) which will have leather tassels attached to the handle end. It'll be painted black and have lettering in fluorescent pink. I'm looking for something funny and costume appropriate to write on the paddle.

Every time I do something with words on a costume, like a logo or name tag, inevitably someone will suggest an alternative and it's almost always better than what I had chosen, and I end up lamenting that I didn't think of it first. So I'd like to hedge against that by getting some feedback beforehand.

My first thought was to write 'Hall Pass' on the paddle, but have 'ASS"" in upper case and the rest in lower case, so it would come out like 'hall pASS'.

So eventually (I'm talking like years in the future right now) I'd like to create a xenomorph cosplay. I was thinking that it would be cool to have the tail be able to make some basic movements like an alerted or investigating drone in alien isolation. I think the best way to describe it would be sort of cat like just much longer than a cats tail. It would usually just drag behind the suit but could move from side to side or lift up slightly. Not like over the head or anything but some animation to give it more personality.

Now I have no idea at the moment how to do this or if it's even possible but if anyone has any ideas or suggestions it would be appreciated. Thanks for reading my post.",Its_Crysis,t2_8cttky2y,1.0,5,7

I'm sorry if this is a little off topic, but cosplayers always know how to explain things. If you know a better sub for this, I'd appreciate a link.

So, a few moments ago, I somehow got a job tomorrow doing intern stuff at the biggest theater in my city.

However, I'm an illustrator who works mainly in ink and watercolor so, I'm not exactly familiar with oils, acrylics or whathaveyou.

Is there any advice you can give me as far as rookie mistakes go, so that I don't look like a total idiot? I'm pretty sure they're painting on wood (but I don't know for sure), don't know what paint, but it's not any sort of spray. I wasn't given many details, so any advice is appreciated.

559,189u7jp,2023-12-03,cosplayprops,Need some help with painting my chainsword.,"I just finished my EVA foam warhammer 40k chainsword and did 4 good layers of plastidip. I am a bit nervous to paint it as it took twice as long and cost twice as much as I anticipated, so messing it up would make me very sad. So I have some questions that I was looking for advice for.

1:  Is there a good way to sand plastidip? I have a few drips of rubber cement on flat panels that I was hoping the dip would hide, but it did not. My alternative would be cover it with battle damage/ dirt. I'm also wondering if another layer or two of plastidip would smooth it over?

2: Are heavy body acrylics worth the price? They are twice as expensive as others in my area but I want a even, bold color. I'll probably do a layer of colored primer as a base tho, so idk if the heavy body are necessary or just overkill.

3: I want to do a clear coat at the end, mostly to make sure paint doesn't rub off the handle or other areas that coule get touched more often. But I don't want to ruin all my work. Can I use regular Matte clear coat spray or is there a better alternative that allows for a bit more control? The sword itself is mainly to display above my desk (see last pic), so I might just do a sealant on the handle and leave the rest alone.

My wife is searching for sharp fangs that would be easy to wear for her cosplays.

From catgirls and werewolves to vampires, 95% of her projects would benefit from good fangs, but she can't find anything she'd be content with. As of now, she has tried two types of stick-on fangs which don't hold well (as in, they're difficult to keep in place even simply during a photo shoot), and wear-on fangs that give her massive gums and feel like teeth guards for boxers or rugby players.

We've searched online, but everything is ""easy to wear"", of course. So, if you folks have recommendations for fang props that are comfortable enough for one to talk with, for example, I'm all ears!

Bonus points if you can (softly) bite someone with them! A vampire photoshoot isn't complete with a neck bite picture, but I understand that technical limitations exist.

668,yd5q55,2022-10-25,cosplayprops,{Help} Heat Sealing EVA foam causing seams to split open.,"Apologies if this has been posted before. I’m new to Reddit and a quick google search didn’t help.

I’ve been building props for the last 5-6 years and usually only work with EVA foam. Most of the time the props I’d make would only need to be used for a Photoshoot or a single con so I didn’t put much time and prep into finishing/sealing before Plastidip and painting. As long as they looked good from a far and held together I was happy.

Currently I’m working on making a scythe for a costume that means a lot to me so I’m putting in a bit more time on making it look polished. I had just finished sanding with my dremel and started to hit the sanded areas with heat to seal it. The issue is—the seams immediately started splitting open. 

I used gel based contact cement to glue the 6mm foam together, and did sand the blade portion of the scythe down quite a bit. So instead of the heat trying to get through 6mm of foam it’s more along the lines of 1-2mm at the thinnest point. 

Is there a way to prevent this from happening? Or another alternative method to soothe the fly always left behind from sanding without heat? I do plan on doing a tester on scrap foam with automotive primer but figured asking here couldn’t hurt since heat will just further split the seams.

So im just gonna list my questions

-So my Baton is made of PVC pipes and i plan to make the spikes out of insulation foam and glue them into holes i already drilled into the pipes.

*Should i glue my whole prop together or leave it seperated in pieces and wrap each piece (cause it's kinda segments on another piece of a pvc pipe) in this black worlba, then paint it?
-
Ive also never worked with worbla on pvc pipes but i assume if i heat it up and wrap it around the pipe it should stick with no problems? yeah?
-
*Also is this the best way to go about painting this? Just after everything is wrapped in worbla i just hit it up with spray paint? or does hand painting work on worbla too?
-
*When i cut out shapes from pink insulation foam do i need a respirator or is a dust mask fine?
I plan on wrapping the small spikes with worbla after ive hand sanded them into cone shapes. Ive heard sanding without a mask is bad and if you heat up insulation foam it emits toxic fumes so im kind of nervous on wrapping hot worbla around cone shaped insulation foam.
(if you guys need pictures on what my baton currently looks like i'll gladly update this for you guys. Thanks in advance!)

But enough complaining, to the research!

[Ps:This is an agrumentary I built up over the years of beeing on reddit, I hope it still counts:](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThingsMatthieuFound/comments/4ieefs/compilation_of_studies_and_arguments_about_the/)

**Tl;dr:** Their are two kind of wage gaps: the adjusted and the unadjusted wage gap:

* The unadjusted one is a problem because even if we can explain aspects of it, it still shows the position of subservience women have in relation to men as well as the double standards that still exists between the two genders.
* The adjusted one is a problem because even accounting for all factor it's still between 4% and 8%. This gap exists because people (men and women) rate a women who is objectively as good as a man as less competent. We don't see this implicit bias we all have, but it's important to acknowledge that it is here.

**Studies:**

**Adjusted and unadjusted wage gap:**

http://blog.dol.gov/2012/06/07/myth-busting-the-pay-gap/

>Decades of research shows a gender gap in pay even after factors like the kind of work performed and qualifications (education and experience) are taken into account. These studies consistently conclude that discrimination is the best explanation of the remaining difference in pay. Economists generally attribute about 40% of the pay gap to discrimination – making about 60% explained by differences between workers or their jobs. 

**Adjusted wage gap:**

http://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9118a9ef-0771-4777-9c1f-8232fe70a45c/compendium---sans-appendix.pdf

> Discrimination is difficult to measure directly. It is illegal, and furthermore, most people don’t recognize discriminatory behavior in themselves or others. This research asked a basic but important question: If a woman made the same choices as a man, would she earn the same pay? The answer is no. 

and

>Ten years out, the unexplained portion of the pay gap widens. AAUW’s analysis showed that while choices mattered, they explained even less of the pay gap ten years after graduation. Controlling for a similar set of factors, we found that ten years after graduation, a 12 percent difference in the earnings of male and female college graduates is unexplained and attributable only to gender. 

**Viewing women as less qualified than men:**

http://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474.abstract

>In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant.

**STEM and advantage/disadvantage of children:**

http://www.nature.com/news/why-women-earn-less-just-two-factors-explain-post-phd-pay-gap-1.19950?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews

>Women earn nearly one-third less than men within a year of completing a PhD in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) field, suggests an analysis of roughly 1,200 US graduates.
Much of the pay gap, the study found, came down to a tendency for women to graduate in less-lucrative academic fields — such as biology and chemistry, which are known to lead to lower post-PhD earnings than comparatively industry-friendly fields, such as engineering and mathematics.
But after controlling for differences in academic field, the researchers found that women still lagged men by 11% in first-year earnings. That difference, they say, was explained entirely by the finding that married women with children earned less than men. Married men with children, on the other hand, saw no disadvantage in earnings.

**Double standards between men and women:**

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-the-gender-pay-gap/2014/07/25/9e5cff34-fcd5-11e3-8176-f2c941cf35f1_story.html?utm_term=.f69371020d64

>Women are less likely than men to ask for a raise , and they don’t negotiate as aggressively. But that doesn’t mean they are less-capable negotiators. Rather, women don’t ask because they fear real repercussions. When women advocate for themselves, they’re often perceived as pushy or unappreciative. Studies have shown that people are less likely to want to work with women who initiate salary discussions, whereas men don’t see the same backlash. “Women are still expected to fulfill prescriptions of feminine niceness,”

and

>Men tend to earn more the more children they have, whereas women see their pay go down with each additional child.

**Conclusion:**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it0EYBBl5LI

>1:14:Right, but so, this 16 to 21% number just looks at all full-time workers. It doesn't account for differences in education, or skills, or experience, or occupation. When you factor all that stuff in, the pay gap shrinks to somewhere between 4 and 8% depending on who's doing the math. This is the so-called ""unexplained pay gap"" that is, there is no economic explanation for it and most nonpartisan analyses agree that this part of the pay gap is directly due to gender discrimination.

and

>4:31:And interestingly, even in careers dominated by women men disproportionately advance to supervisory roles. Like, most librarians are women, but male librarians are disproportionately likely to become library directors. And there are still large pay gaps within careers that employ mostly women, from nursing to librarianship. In fact, unless you really cherry pick the data, a real and consistent gender pay gap exists across almost all fields at all education levels at all ages. [...] In short [...] there IS a gender pay gap but it is not as simple as women making 77 or 79 cents for every dollar men make. Instead, it's an extremely complicated web of interwoven factors.

**Common counter argument:** 

**If women are payed less, why aren't employer only hiring women?**

->Humans are not perfect rational being, the bias is non-conscious to begin with, because people (men and women) think men are more competent and will bring in more money than equally competent women, so they pay them more. *We don't see this implicit bias we all have, but it's important to acknowledge that it is here.*

**It's normal that there is a wage gap, and there will always be one, because men and women are fundamentally different and make different choices.**

->Then why is it different from country to country? *Which wage gap is the ""natural"" one?* This shows that the wage gap is mainly due to culture, or else we would expect the wage gap to be the same everywhere, and not due to the intrinsic difference between men and women. If the gap is due to culture (which it is, like demonstrated above), we should strive to change this culture to achieve greater equality for everybody.

[and quoting](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadSocialScience/comments/3gxho1/the_wage_gap_doesnt_exist_because_we_can_know_the/cu2f7g7/) /u/Naggins:

->""Why do women choose lower paying professions? Why don't women rate money as a primary concern in job choice? Why don't women request pay raises as much as men? Perhaps these questions are too difficult. Or perhaps it's because if one thinks hard about the answers to these questions, one is faced with the fact that women are assigned a gender role of subservience to men in the workforce, one that still frames men as primary breadwinners, and one that discourages the assertiveness and confidence required to request a pay raise. Even then, many people explain these things away by spouting unsubstantiated biotruths, *suggesting that women have an innate inclination towards subservience and meekness* just because that's how things have apparently been in Western society for the last ~10-1500 years. *These claims have no basis in scientific fact* and even if they did, do not account for the regulation of innate inclinations by societal constructs and prejudices.""

**The adjusted wage gap is only five percent, this is negligible.**

->Five percent is not negligible, would you agree to take a five percent cut in your paycheck just because you are a man, or just because you're white? *On an median american income of 50'000$ per year, this is 2500$ lost.*

This is a good question -- a pretty deep one, actually. If wage discrimination isn't arbitraged away in the labor market, that would seem to suggest there are some major and persistent imperfections in the labor market. Possibly that there are major misallocation problems in the economy more broadly. Moreover, if arbitrage won't wipe out discrimination, what will? Presumably, the answer is policy.

So getting this question right matters.

That's why I was so disappointed when I saw u/edprescott come in to that thread and give this answer to that question:

Err, sorry, let me translate from parseltongue:

> Arbitrage already has wiped out all the discrimination that occurs within occupation-experience-skill cells. That is why there is no gender wage gap when you control for things -- because there is no taste discrimination component to the gender wage gap.

So if you're looking to fill a specific open position in your firm, you're looking within an education-industry-experience cluster and won't see (much of) a wage gap. (It's still there, but smaller.) **This part is important because it means you can't arbitrage it away at a fine-grained micro level.**

-u/Integralds, but emphasis is mine


So, why is this overall a bad answer to the question: ""why doesn't wage discrimination get arbitraged away?"" 

**A. It underplays the magnitude of wage gap that clearly could be arbitraged away and, due to this empirical error, mistakenly overestimates the efficacy of arbitrage in imperfect and highly fricitonal labor markets.**

[Blau and Kahn's](http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel.20160995) recent JEL on the GWG find that the raw raw gender wage gap is around 23 percentage points in the PSID. Using the PSID's rich wealth of variables on industry, occupation, education, experience, etc. to control for the kitchen sink, the residual gender wage gaps falls to 8 percentage points at the mean. 

So, roughly one third of the wage is unexplained and apparently going unarbitraged away. This strikes me as sufficiently substantial in size so as to discredit any ""actually, arbitrage mostly already wiped out the GWG"" type explanation.

Now, integralds may be inclined to argue that this isn't a failure of arbitrage and that women within the same industry-occupation-experience cells as men just are of lower productivity in unobserved ways. But I would suggest that, if anything, the opposite seems more likely to be true, [as bias in hiring and promotion processes can result in women of being stuck in the same positions as less talented men.
](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.90.4.715) I would also add that these GWG estimates probably are underestimates of the GWG you would get if you were to adjust wages for the compensating differentials one would expect women to receive for enduring common female gender specific workplace disamenities (that is to say, sexual harassment and the like).

And while we're at it, why limited ourselves to the GWG? [There's a real big racial wage gap](http://econ2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ321/orazem/Charles_GuryanPrejudiceWages.pdf) (and racial employment gap) that persists even [when you go hog wild controlling for all kinds of crazy stuff like AFQT.](http://www.uh.edu/~jlehman2/papers/Lang_Lehmann_JEL.pdf) Why hasn't arbitrage wiped *that* out?

And, actually, come to think of it. What about historical data? Why didn't arbitrage wipe out the racial and gender wage gaps back in 1950? Was it the case even back then that there just wasn't much of a gap to arbitrage? Or was the problem that markets were less competitive back then and that the narrowing of the gaps we've seen since then is [mainly due to market competitiveness increasing](http://www.nber.org/papers/w23687) and arbitrage ([pictured here](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/08/25/ap207187706677_wide-cd2b17e8babbeb109458f0b31d141849be9600fa.jpg?s=1400)) finally kicking in to solve the problem.

**B. It falsely concludes that arbitrage cannot wipe out the portions of the gender wage gap that are caused by differences across industry-occupation-education cells.** (""This part is important because it means you can't arbitrage it away at a fine-grained micro level."")

This is, of course, not true. I won't waste your time too much with the classic MHE analysis here, but in as much as the variation in those industry/occupation/education X variables is driven by end stage wage or hiring discrimination, then that component of the wage gap actually could be reduced by arbitrage at the end stage. Moreover, as seen in the orchestra paper linked above, even if one observes no apparent gender wage gap within industry-occupation-education cells, that does not necessarily imply there is not an ability conditional wage gap that potentially could be arbitraged away and, in turn, push down the magnitude of the GWG attributed to the X variables. So, actually, the amount of wage discrimination that arbitrage could be expected to get rid of (and is not currently getting rid of) is actually probably greater than what is seen in A.

I would also like to pay particular attention to the issue of workplace flexibility here. [Goldin highlights the importance of workplace flexibility](https://scholar.harvard.edu/goldin/publications/grand-gender-convergence-its-last-chapter) as a key determinant of the gender wage gap and the variation in it across occupations and across firms within occupations. A key point that she makes is that the costliness of providing workplace flexibility is endogenous to technology and to managerial decisions relating to how the production process is structured. Firms and indeed entire occupations have, in the past, reduced the productivity cost of providing workplace flexibility to their employees and have in turn reduced the gender wage gap with it. It is not at all clear, then, that the portion of the gender wage gap you attribute to occupational/industry differences and to childbearing cannot, in fact, be arbitraged away by clever firms finding relatively low cost ways of providing workpace flexibility. Now, it's not clear to what extent this is possible, but it seems unlikely that the answer is ""not at all"".



**C. Given the empirical issues with the ""actually, arbitrage mostly works"" hypothesis, it misses the better answer: that labor markets are sufficiently imperfect and frictional that one *should not expect* wage discrimination to be arbitraged away.**

Now, in fairness, integralds already [made a reply to this point:
](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/79s8uk/the_fiat_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/dp4rzoj/)
>I know all about frictions. Frictions alone don't do any work for you.
You need to argue that the frictions differentially affect men and women.

Yeah no, imperfect competition and frictions alone are definitely good enough to prevent arbitrage from wiping out employer taste discrimination. The Becker model strictly relies on perfect competition, meaning that if there is imperfect competition or monopsony power in the labor market (there is) the arbitrage-nukes-wage-discrimination results go away. Plus, even way back when, Arrow pointed out that misc old timey frictions like adjustment costs can wipe out the arbitrage results. To be a bit more modern though, [search frictions](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2535106?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) will do the trick. Moving to a [posted wage offers model](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828054825547) will do it too, meaning that [directed search doesn't enable competition to bail us out either](http://www.nber.org/papers/w17450.pdf). 

Heck, and even given all that, you don't *really* even need frictions to prevent arbitrage from wiping out wage gaps. Consumer taste discrimination and employee taste discrimination can persist indefinitely in the face of perfectly competitive market forces. As can employer taste discrimination, [provided you relabel discrimination from being about distaste for group X to taste for group Y.](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/97/2/307/1930399?redirectedFrom=fulltext) (Which is to say, competition won't wipe out the GWG provided your Harvey Weinsteins of the world don't mind losing a contract or two if it means they get to discriminate most of the time.)

Now, granted, this doesn't mean that competition can't be expected to depress wage discrimination to some degree. There is [some](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001979390405700404) [evidence](http://www.nber.org/papers/w6321) that it does. But the thrust of the literature [(see the excellent review here)](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22022) is that labor markets are sufficiently imperfect and frictioned up that competition just can't arbitrage away the gender wage gap, the racial wage gap, or any other wage gap you can think of.

Which, actually, isn't all that surprising when you think about it. I mean, the market doesn't even arbitrage away [productivity dispersion across firms in the same industry](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20161024). But that's another story.

Oh, and to get one last lick in, remember this?

> You need to argue that the frictions differentially affect men and women.

[Here ya go.](http://www.nber.org/papers/w7258) I know, I know, the Black 95 search model already shows how search frictions generate monopsony power for employers specifically against the workers subjected to taste discrimination. But this one is fun just because of how idiosyncratic at is. If women are disproportionately likely to be secondary earners that accept their husbands' location decisions, that reduces their ability to quit and look for new jobs and generates a source of gender specific monopsony power in the labor market. Hence the nurse thing.

**In summary:**

**1. There is monopsony power in the labor market.**

**2. There are search and matching frictions in the labor market.**

**3. (1) and (2), among other factors relating to the precise nature of the discrimination in play, prevent arbitrage from wiping out wage discrimination in the labor market.**

**4. At the end of the day, when it comes to policy time, I'd reckon the DoJ is a better bet than competition for wiping out employer taste discrimination.**",gorbachev,t2_3g3fi,0.88,238,211
700,s7iekd,2022-01-19,badeconomics,*Repost* Why women joining the workforce doesn't reduce wages (Response to Whatifalthist)," I'm reposting this to get more traction and that welfare-enhancing karma. For some reason there were visibility issues with the previous post I had made.

Firstly, here is shameless advertising for the video I made of this R1 for my YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDoUdMjQRBE).

The quote is from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIJq79HsvuU&list=WL&index=4&t=274s). It's worth listening to the section for the sheer audacity and confidence on display on a point the author gets very, very wrong.

From about 4 minutes, we get the following quote:

>…This all made 1945 to 1970 in the West and Japan the greatest era to the common person in history. However, a series of processes started to increase competition for wages. Firstly, immigration and women entering the workforce increased wage competition. I’m not saying these were inherently bad moves, women and immigrants improved their societies in countless ways but basic economics dictates when you increase the supply of something and demand can’t keep up then the cost goes down and when you get down to it, people are a commodity like any other.

**Part 1**

I put this example in as I quite like his political commentary, while his economic commentary is…lacking. But also he exemplifies the typical view people have when discussing the effects of women and wages. And he is a very popular YouTuber.

It seems to make sense, right? It seems so logical. There’s a lump of labour out there, and all of a sudden there’s a large increase of people, in this case women, vying for those jobs. And so it’s easy to see how that competition among so many people now wanting jobs would lead to employers not feeling the need to pay as much per employee, and thus lowering aggregate wages. Well firstly, it’s literally not bourne by the data.

For good measure, here are 2 graphs showing wage growth in Australia since 1997. These I made from ABS data.

[https://imgur.com/3tqEtfG](https://imgur.com/3tqEtfG)

[https://imgur.com/KRUtrnN](https://imgur.com/KRUtrnN)

These graph might not look great, with real wages not tracking per capita GDP growth, but we can see that in the US and Australia wages didn’t go down by a significant amount since the 1960s. Okay but there are declines and we would actually expect wages to have grown faster than what we see here. So maybe that’s the decline people are referring to. Is this due to women all of a sudden joining the labour force en masse?

This plays into and affirms the idea of the male breadwinner. The idea is that we had a simpler equilibria in the 50s, 60s and 70s, whereby men went to work and women largely stayed at home. This also plays into the idea that nowadays both parents need to work just to get by whereas previously it was possible just one person to work and for the family to do fine. This of course ignores two inconvenient facts. The first is that two people now both want to work because they can now afford more things than they could previously. People are no longer happy with what just 1 income can get them. Keeping up with the Jones’ and all that. Also this ignores the fact that when women were working at home was still doing work however it was unpaid labour. And since everything is measured in monetary terms GDP growth that meant that all of the work and all of the frankly really hard work that women were doing at home was not measured in statistics. And so ultimately all that happened when women started to join the workforce on mass is that they were now getting paid to work whereas previously they were not.

That’s what the proponents are usually saying with these kind of arguments, and it’s certainly what the YouTuber would have in mind too. Let’s go into more detail into breaking down the argument. Our first example in Part 2 will actually look at a source that on the surface refutes the claims and evidence above. We’ll finish examining this source at the end of this R1.

**Part 2**

We start off with our first source, Women, War, and Wages: The Effect of Female Labor Supply on the Wage Structure at Midcentury, by Daron Acemoglu, David Autor and David Lyle.

The paper looks at the participation of women in the labour force after 1940, as American men went into war. They discuss the differences between states where the mobilization rate of men was high and states with lower mobilization rates. Naturally, the states where more men left for war meant more women could come into the labour force to replace those men, and the study further found that in such states after 1950 those women tended to stay in the labour force. Conversely, in the states where fewer men went to war, women who went into the labour force then dropped out of the labour force after 1950.

The conclusion states:

1. Greater female labour supply reduces female wages. A 10 percent increase in female labour supply relative to male labour supply lowers female wages by 7–8 percent.
2. Greater female labour supply also reduces male wages. A 10 percent increase in relative female labour supply typically lowers male earnings by 3–5 percent.
3. The combination of these two findings indicates that male and female labour inputs are imperfect substitutes
4. The impact of female labour supply on male earnings is not uniform throughout the male earnings distribution. Women drawn into the labour market by the war were closer substitutes for men at the middle of the skill distribution than for those with either the lowest or highest education.

This would seem to be a slam dunk, and seems to completely refutes the point I was making at the start. It is clear from this source that the states where more women joined the labour force actually had a negative impact on wages for both genders. This would seem to confirm what people imagine what the effects are of women joining the labour force. The men leave, women join the labour force where they previously weren’t working, this increases competition and bam lower wages for all. Plus the source states explicitly that during this period women weren’t perfect substitutes for men with the lowest education, who same men who would overwhelming be the ones who went to war.

Slam dunk, right? How could I possibly come back from this? Let’s keep this in mind and look at other studies and see if we can square this circle.

**Part 3**

[Let’s](https://hbr.org/2018/01/when-more-women-join-the-workforce-wages-rise-including-for-men) look at the next source, When More Women Join the Workforce, Wages Rise — Including for Men by Amanda Weinstein.

After accounting for various other factors that may affect FLFPR and wage growth (e.g., average commute times and housing prices), they key takeaway from the article is that every 10% increase in the female labour force participation rate in a metropolitan area is associated with a 5% increase in median real wages — for both men and women.

The article says there are unanswered questions. Although the research suggests that firms in cities are becoming more productive by hiring more women, the exact mechanism is unclear. Women may increase the competitiveness of labour markets, giving firms the option to choose from a bigger, more qualified pool of candidates. They may also be providing firms with a unique set of skills and perspectives that men do not provide. Women’s inclusion in these office spaces may help firms better represent their customers and understand their customer’s needs, as women now make the vast majority of household decisions and control the lion’s share of consumer spending.

Our next source is: Working women in the city and urban wage growth in the United States by Amanda Weinstein

Amanda tells us that if women entering the labour force impacts the local economy only be increasing the quantity of labour, either because the demand curve has shifted or they are shifting the labour supply curve, we would then expect that their increasing numbers would have no impact at all or would actually drive down wages. This could be especially true if women are entering low-paying female-dominated occupations and industries (either by choice or discrimination, and as an aside, this is the heart of the gender wage gap.). This is the argument that nothing changes when women enter the workforce and that they are taking jobs traditionally being done by men, increasing supply and thus lowering wages for all. But if women are bringing unique and complementary skills into the workforce, then we would expect productivity and efficiency to increase, which increases wages for everyone. This is a more dynamic story than the former and women entering the workforce changes the qualitative aspect of workers, and thus bringing something new to the table helps the business increase productivity. Women bring different skills to the table, and these are complementary, helping raise wages because they raise overall productivity. They are not straight substitutes for men. Also women are now getting Bachelor degrees at a higher rate than men. Also there are certain roles women are better suited for as they make 75% of the household decisions according to research and so with the help of women, businesses are better able to represent their consumers.

[https://imgur.com/CiavCl0](https://imgur.com/CiavCl0)

From Page 600 we see a scatterplot showing female labour force participation rate against the change in median wages. Here we see a strong positive relationship, highlighting the benefits of more participation by women in the workforce. Quote from the source, “The scatter plot shows, for example, that well-educated cities like Boston, Massachusetts, and Stamford, Connecticut, clearly experience higher wage growth than expected based on FLFPRs alone. It also shows that areas like Flint, Michigan, and Youngstown, Ohio, do particularly poorly even more than their lower FLFPR would suggest”

Women may also be replacing less productive men, which would explain the higher wages for men that remain in the market as well as lower participation rates of men over time. Cities with higher MLFPR may be cities where women are having a more difficult time replacing less productive men.

[https://imgur.com/FaPeRHz](https://imgur.com/FaPeRHz)

But the positive effects of women joining the workforce seem to be slowing, and there are diminishing returns. The hypothesis is that because of the gender wage gap, women are not joining industries or occupations that pay the most, and thus are not increasing productivity or GDP. And so the gains from them joining the labour force are not realised. The unique skills they could bring to such roles is missed, and there is lower productivity than what we would see otherwise. Discrimination persists and women are still discouraged from joining certain industries. Childcare and related costs are increasing, and thus many women join jobs that are easier to manage given that they are needed in the home. But these are not high productivity or high paying jobs, and so society at large pays the costs in the form of lost productivity. As women are typically expected to manage the house, it’s harder to have a career and contribute to that high-productivity job.

What does our next source have to say? That would be The Effects of Rising Female Labor Supply on Male Wages by Chinhui Juhn and Dae Il Kim.

They find weak evidence that college-educated women are substitutes for high school dropout men or that college-educated women may be better substitutes for high school dropout men than high school graduate men, thereby widening inequality in the bottom half of the male wage distribution. Instead, they evidence that college-educated women are substitutes for college-educated men and that their rapid entry into the labour market may have actually tempered the growth in male wage inequality in the 1980s.

(Page 25) we get the following quote: “Our results based on all three measures of skill clearly indicate that women increased the relative supply of skill in the economy in the 1980s. This is a break from past trend where women have typically added more labour to the bottom than the top skill categories.” This is an important point that will pay off in the final part of this analysis.

This article examines the extent that rapid increases in female labour supply contributed to rising wage inequality and to declining real wages of less skilled males during the 1980s. They find that (1) female labour supply growth slowed in the 1980s relative to the 1970s, and (2) women increased the relative supply of skill in the economy in the 1980s. These findings are inconsistent with a simple story in which supply shifts among women have played a major role. Instead the paper finds that the rapid inequality growth of the 1980s actually stems from demand side factors and how businesses were asking for different skills than in previous decades, which impacted less skilled males the most. It was not due to the fact that there were now more women in the labour force.

**Part 4**

Let’s go back to the first source. The conclusion is that the wages for both women and men went down in 1940s but the effects were uneven. With states with a greater mobilisation of men for war, it seems that wages for women that entered the workforce during that time grew less than in states with lower mobilisation rates. And so it seems that during this period, women weren't perfect substitutes for men, and thus were perhaps not as productive, and as a result earned less. I read this as the jobs that the men had were predominantly ones that required more physical strength, and when they left for the war, it wasn't as easy to replace them with women, who on average tend not to have the same physical size. Why does that matter? That’s because this is the period whereby women joining the workforce replaced predominantly unskilled workers, and weren’t as productive.

And so as per my previous quote, this is a time when women more typically added labour to the bottom skill categories rather than the top skilled categories. This period is also one where women were not encouraged to get an education and thus could not compete with or replace more educated men.

So we have the following quote:

“Contrary to a common hypothesis in the literature, we also find that women at midcentury were not the closest substitutes for the lowest-education men, but for high school graduate men.”

So I read that as when it comes to education and roles that require softer skills women are close substitute for men in those areas, but when it comes to lower educated men, who overwhelmingly do physical work, women weren't close substitutes for them. And so when it came to the states with the highest mobilisation rates for WW2, you had job openings, but a large increase in supply from women, but who weren't perfect substitutes for the men who left for the war, and thus were a drag on wages for both men and women.

**Conclusion**

Clearly women joining the workforce en masse didn’t lower wages for either men or women. This does not appear anywhere in the data. There is evidence that women joining the workforce during WW2 lowered wages for both men and women, as women were not perfect substitutes for the men they replaced. I’ve already explained how I read that conclusion. However, as more women starting receiving an education, they were substitutes for higher-educated men, and brought unique skills to the table that helped the economy grow faster. This is why we see per capita GDP rising, wages for both men and women rising as more women joined the workforce. From the data, it’s also the case that in most US cities where the proportion of women in the workforce is lower also leads to lower median wage growth and sometimes negative growth. It looks like you now can’t afford to not have women in the workforce. Also, a higher proportion of women are now getting degrees than men, and in many sectors women are replacing low-productivity men helping drive economic growth. Good times.

However, there seems to be diminishing returns to women joining the workforce as ongoing gender discrimination prevents women from joining the highest-productivity jobs, and replacing men in those roles who perhaps aren’t as productive as they could be. Women are discouraged from joining many high productivity sectors, and hence they cannot bring their unique skills to the table and expand the pie for everyone.

I hope you enjoyed my R1!

(Really late edit to clarify that I'm responding to Zach Goldberg's article, not Noah Smith's article.)

In [Noah Smith's recent column on Jewish achievement](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/a-response-to-scott-alexander-on), he links to a [post by Zach Goldberg](https://zachgoldberg.substack.com/p/exposing-the-group-disparities-discrimination) on racial disparities in the US. Goldberg presents some neat data in this article. Beyond that, he argues against the view that ""persistent outcome disparities between racial groups necessarily reflect or result from discrimination.""

It's almost certain that there is at least one other factor besides just racism causing the outcome disparities -- that is a low bar to clear. It's also very likely that not all group disparities are caused by discrimination (and instead could be selective immigration, for example). Goldberg could be correct in his conclusion. However, I don't believe the argument presented in the article is strong and justifies the conclusion.

Goldberg's argument, summarized by his section headings, are as follows:

* Disparities between groups are the norm, not the exception -- even among 'whites'. (Evidence: age/sex-adjusted US-born median personal incomes/SES by self-reported ancestry.)

* Disparities between ancestry groups tend to be fairly persistent across time. And this persistence has no obvious connection to discrimination. (Evidence: same as above, over time)

* Racial disparities in socioeconomic outcomes typically disappear when controlling for differences in cognitive ability. (Evidence: controlling for AFQT scores reduce racial disparities.)

Goldberg concludes with:

> But the truth is that group disparities are likely inevitable in any genetically and culturally diverse population. And this is especially likely to be the case in countries like the US, where immigrant groups (voluntary and involuntary) have typically varied in how they compare (in terms of ability, skills, education etc.) to the average person in their populations of origin. The point is not that discrimination can’t contribute to disparities, but that large disparities exist, emerge, and persist even in its absence (we only don’t pay attention to them because the ancestry groups in question were never or are no longer politicized). The upshot is that it may be impossible to determine the relative contribution of discrimination to disparities. As such, the claim that disparities between whites and African Americans are entirely the product of discrimination (or the fault of ‘white people’) is essentially unfalsifiable and should have no weight in determining public policy. Likewise, the assumption that lingering effects of historical discrimination must matter because we’re not far removed from segregation is also dubious. Those who hold this assumption need to ask themselves: at what point can we finally say that we’re far enough removed from Jim Crow that it no longer exerts a meaningful influence on the outcomes of African Americans? If the answer is ‘when outcomes between them and whites have equalized’, then you’re effectively committing to a standard that may not be possible to meet (and not for want of trying, but for much the same or similar reasons that it isn’t met between the Dutch and Chinese). And anything short of equality of outcomes will always be taken as ‘evidence’ that the effects of systemic racism are still operative.

> To be sure, none of the above entails that nothing can or should be done to address the consequences of inequality and improve the quality of life for all. It only means that, rather than pointlessly obsessing over group disparities and blaming and penalizing groups that ‘do too well’ to artificially uplift those that don’t, we should focus on raising the floor for everyone. And this entails catering to the needs NOT of ancestral groups, but of individuals—be they of Dutch, Acadian, or African ancestry.

The conclusions presented in that very last paragraph are at least possibly reasonable, and I'm not going to touch on them. It's the argument in support of it that I find lacking.

---------------------------------------

I have two main objections to this article:

The first objection is around what it means for discrimination to cause differences in outcomes. If Goldberg's argument is that active prejudice today may not be causing disparities in outcomes today, then this is both stronger but also narrower. His data presented in the third section of the article is closer to support this narrow argument. However, the question of whether outcome differences are caused by past or present discrimination could be more relevant for activists and policymakers. For example, there could be a moral case for restitution if those differences arose from past discrimination.

It's easy to imagine differences in human capital accumulation persisting across time and generations, and Goldberg's data presents evidence of exactly that happening. The basic Lucas endogenous growth model has human capital accumulation across with infinitely-lived agents. More realistically, a child's human capital accumulation likely depends on their parent's human capital (e.g., [vocabulary exposure](https://www.naeyc.org/resources/pubs/tyc/feb2014/the-word-gap) ), direct financial investments (e.g., private school, summer camps), and time investments (which can depend on parental income).

My second objection is that, similar to problems with the ""kitchen sink"" approach to estimating the gender wealth gap (see the [""Bad Controls"" section of the /r/economics Gender Wage Gap FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_genderwagegap)), the effect of race is going to be artificially smaller if you separately control for something that is affected by racial discrimination. This means Goldberg's evidence does not even rule out present discrimination which is contributing to outcome disparities. In fact, the data could instead show the channel (childhood education) of how discrimination creates disparate outcomes today.

It's easy to imagine discrimination today affecting how much a child learns, and thus their AFQT scores. From a very brief search, there's [evidence that teacher expectations affect student performance](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/09/18/161159263/teachers-expectations-can-influence-how-students-perform). There's been evidence that [teachers may give students different grades, in this example based on gender](https://ideas.time.com/2013/02/06/do-teachers-really-discriminate-against-boys/). [A study found teachers in India discriminate based on caste](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w15057/w15057.pdf).

Overall, it could be the case that outcome disparities of some racial groups are due to non-discrimination factors like selective immigration. That does not rule out discrimination as a cause for outcome disparities of other groups. More importantly, the fact that outcomes of newly-immigrating minorities are better than those of minorities who grew up in the US is consistent with both of these sources of discrimination which Goldberg does not rule out. Newly-immigrating minorities would not have parents who suffered from discrimination in the past, nor would present discrimination have decreased their human capital accumulation today.",abetadist,t2_3lq2j,0.87,107,49

703,49k23i,2016-03-08,badeconomics,"The problem with controlling for ""all other factors"" when looking at pay discrimination","This comes up most often on Reddit in regards to gender pay inequality, but it applies to any time when we're looking at any form of labor discrimination. When the issue of pay inequality is brought up there's always several comments pointing out that when controlling for ""all other factors"" most of the difference goes away. This is essentially victim blaming, and shows up in comments that often take the form of ""but women work less hours than men"" or something similar.

Here's an example to show why ""controlling"" for other factors doesn't mean that we should wholesale ignore the impact those factors contribute to the problem:

* Let's assume we have a simple market described [by these labor curves](https://i.imgur.com/ZCFZ34y.png)
* All the workers in this market share the same supply of labor curve
* All the employers in the market discriminate against 1/2 of the workers in the market, which results in 2nd, lower, demand for labor curve.
* If we study this market we'll see clearly that one group earns substantially less, and if control for all other factors we can see that the difference in hourly wages between the two is 10% ($50 vs $45)
* But we also see that the 2nd group of works only chooses to work about 91% as many hours as the 1st group.
* We could naively we blame the 2nd group for choosing to work less, control for that variable, and determine that the true cost of discrimination in this population is 10%
* But if recognize that both groups are making the exact same decisions in regards to the amount they're willing to work at every wage level, we can see that the actual effect of the discrimination is a 19% reduction in earnings.

Now obviously, it's possible that the two groups might develop different supply of labor curves. And in reality it's extremely difficult to figure out the shape of the labor curves in any single industry, never mind over different geographies and also taking in to account the many different ways that different groups can face wage discrimination.


But I hope that the point is clear - controlling for a variable isn't a magic wand that can untangle all the interrelated co-dependencies of even an extremely simple market like the one above. In the real world we should be extremely suspicious of anyone who claims to be able to perfectly control for a long list of possible factors to give a 'true' result.",newdefinition,t2_lond8,0.73,98,281
704,4d6k5f,2016-04-03,badeconomics,Review of the week 5: Deeply Bayesian Sociology,"The subject of this morning's RI is [this paper](http://genderbias.net/docs/resources/guideline/Does%20bad%20pay%20cause%20occupations%20to%20feminize,%20Does%20feminization%20reduce%20pay,%20and%20How%20can%20we%20tell%20with%20longitudinal.pdf) as cited in [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/upshot/as-women-take-over-a-male-dominated-field-the-pay-drops.html?_r=0). The thesis of the article is in the title: *""As Women Take Over a Male-Dominated Field, the Pay Drops""*.

The quote we'll investigate is this one from sociologist Paula England:

    Once women start doing a job, “It just doesn’t look like it’s as
    important to the bottom line or requires as much skill,”

Which is a conclusion supposed to be drawn from [England (2012)](http://www.statisticalhorizons.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/88.2.levanon.pdf) . This is what's called the ""devaluation theory"" in the wage gap literature, the view that male centric work is seen as ""more valuable"", basically the *pure discrimination* view. 

Now we'll leave the obvious criticism of the quote aside for today. This criticism is basically supply and demand -- when women start doing a traditionally man dominated job, aggregate supply of worker increases and hence market price lowers. Then there is the issue of drawing causal inference in these sorts of statistical exercises which was talked about [here some time ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/49k23i/the_problem_with_controlling_for_all_other/) and [Levine(2003)](http://www.policyalmanac.org/economic/archive/pay_equity.pdf) addresses as such:

>     Whether women limit their fields of work in order to fulfill family responsibilities or discrimination confines
    women to certain jobs, the market’s wage response is the same: the abundant supply of women to certain jobs 
    relative to employer demand will prompt firms to use more women than otherwise and, in hiring each 
    new worker, spread complementary inputs (e.g.,  capital)  more  thinly;  this,  in  turn,  decreases  the  
    productivity  of  workers  in female-dominated jobs, and consequently, their earnings.

Basically, you can't imply any sort of causality when observing an effect in this context.

But let's leave all of these completely valid criticisms aside. Instead, let us focus on Ms. England's body of work supporting the quote. To do this, we need to [go back to 2007](http://genderbias.net/docs/resources/guideline/Does%20bad%20pay%20cause%20occupations%20to%20feminize,%20Does%20feminization%20reduce%20pay,%20and%20How%20can%20we%20tell%20with%20longitudinal.pdf), 5 years before the 2012 article supporting the quote. In this article titled *""Does Bad Pay Cause Occupations to Feminize""*, England first does a literature review on wage gap, citing 5 articles, all using longitudinal data, then uses a panel data model to differentiate itself from previous methodology. 

The idea is to test whether the devaluation theory is plausible, or if lower paying jobs attracted women (which remember from above, *we can't know using these methods*). She briefly contemplates the competing theory (that wage differential is partly explainable by non-wage compensation, like time flexibility), but notes it is espoused by ""neoclassical economists"".

Now a few things are to be noted here. First, she uses the words ""causal effects"" in situations where this is distressingly not applicable. More importantly, all of the longitudinal studies all state findings of evidence for the devaluation theory from studying the evolution of wage and the man/woman proportion in the industry overtime. 

Also, let's call the ""longitudinal methods"" they use what they are: distributed lag models. As any undergrad will tell you, you should test for stationarity whenever you have an AR(p) component in a model, yet, none of this literature ever does this. Not once is are the words ""station"", ""unit root"", or ""difference"" mentionned in any of these papers.

Now England (2007), using panel data does not find any relevant effects supporting devaluation theory, and notes that the previous studies were in all likelihood suffering from omitted variable bias. Note that England (2007)'s panel model also uses an AR(p) component not testing for non-stationarity, so I'd take all of this lightly, but maybe I'm asking too much. She notes:

>  One interpretation is simply
that the reported association between occupations’ sex composition and wages has
always been spurious rather than causal, due to some unidentified omitted variable. [...] This is not our interpretation, however.

She then proceeds to tell a 3 page story (founded in no empirics whatsoever) explaining away her results. And, in 2012, 5 years later, she publishes the paper linked above, where she uses the same bad time series methodology as the papers she critiqued herself in her literature review, and finds the same results as the stated literature. This is what's quoted in the NYT article published this week.

And this, my friends, is **""Deeply Bayesian""** methodology in it's full glory.",VodkaHaze,t2_89d6j,0.97,75,129
705,9tyrgw,2018-11-04,badeconomics,"Omitted Variable Bias and the ""Costs"" of Ethnic Diversity","Haven't posted in a good long while, so let's get down to it.

Because I'm a filthy SJW, I sometimes lurk /r/socialjustice101.  Today, I saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialjustice101/comments/9ts2f6/how_to_talk_about_the_down_sides_of_high/) post, which draws heavily from [this](http://economicsdetective.com/2016/07/costs-ethnic-diversity-garett-jones/) podcast episode.  The post basically makes claims that ethnic diversity reduces group performance, productivity, and has other undesirable features.  We'll talk through some simple econometrics first, then I'll address why making the claim that ethnic diversity is causally-related to the aforementioned outcomes MUST be made with care, and that in the case of the podcast/blog and the post in general, it usually isn't.  Indeed, many of the papers cited don't even make that claim (or even the claims attributed to them).

To clarify, I'm not making the claim that diversity has positive economics effects, merely that the negative effects mentioned in the OP are misstated, overstated, or in some cases, are inherently unknowable in their current specification.  Let's get started.

&#x200B;

# 1.) Basic Intuition

Spurious correlations are all around us.  Ice cream sales are correlated with drownings.  Obesity rates correlate with the housing bubble.  We've all heard the maxim *correlation doesn't imply causation*, but it can be a hard thing to shake ourselves out of, especially when faced with messy causal inference we find intuitive.  For instance, it may be intuitive for some to observe that increasing the aggregate number of differences in a population would make that population less productive.  What goes unanswered here is the question: ""why might ethnic differences make a country less productive?""  No doubt you could make some broad appeal that ethnic homogeneity creates a sense of community germane to greater cooperation, and indeed that is the claim, but usually made in the reverse: that groups in diverse societies have low trust/sympathy for other groups dissimilar from themselves.

The subtle point here is that *racial mistrust or animus* is the channel through which productivity falls, not racial diversity.  The thing to consider here is the unobserved counterfactual: that a country with high ethnic diversity, but no racism, has an unknown (though possibly nonnegative) relationship between productivity and diversity.  This might seem like splitting hairs, but it's actually quite important in contending with the idea that racial diversity leads to bad outcomes.  But let's formalize things a little...

# 

# 2.) Econometric Intuition

Consider the simple linear regression model

log(**productivity\_i )= β\_0 + β\_1\*diversity\_i + δ\*controls\_i+ ε\_i**

Let's say productivity\_i is the number of widgets produced by country *i*, the first beta term is an intercept term, and the second is the coefficient on diversity (let's say that's indexed by the probability that two random draws from the population of country *i* are from different ethnic groups).  Delta is a vector of coefficients for *n* country-level controls for country *i.*  Epsilon is the idiosyncratic error term associated with country *i*.  Let's say I regress productivity on diversity and find a negative coefficient, say -1.04.  Broadly speaking, that means (conditional on our controls) a 1-point increase in the probability that two random draws are from different ethnic groups leads to a 4% decrease in widgets produced.

Now, the first question we need to ask ourselves is this: is it feasible that racism could depress the productivity of a nation?  I think a simple appeal to a Becker discrimination model says that it could since in equilibrium, firms are willing to forgo profits in order to compensate their discriminatory tastes.

So, inasmuch as racism is living out there in the wilds of the error term, that's a problem.  Why?  Consider the equation for our estimate of the coefficient on diversity:

**β\_1(estimate)=β\_1(true)+\[Covariance(diversity, ε)/n\*variance(diversity)\]**

In order for our estimate of the effect of diversity on productivity to be unbiased, it needs to be the case that the covariance between the error term and the independent variable MUST be zero, which means (loosely speaking) that the independent variable must be uncorrelated with the error term.  But is it reasonable to assume that racism and diversity are uncorrelated?  That seems like an UNREASONABLY strong claim, especially given the evidence to the contrary cited by OP themselves.

In the above equation, everything in braces \[ \] is bias in our estimate of the effect of diversity on productivity.  How biased is our estimate, and in what direction?  It depends on the (unobserved) correlations between racism and diversity AND racism and productivity.  But this is precisely my point: ***until we control for racism, it is impossible to detect the effect of diversity on productivity.***

&#x200B;

\*\*\*A Caveat

In the case where racism is jointly determined by diversity and productivity, controlling for racism introduces selection bias by conditioning on a collider.  I'm not sympathetic to the view that this is reality, but am open to hearing the case argued.

&#x200B;

# 3.) Addressing the Cited Sources

These sources almost all cite each other, so I'll discuss them in classes:

&#x200B;

1.) Summary Papers: Williams & O'Reilly (1996) and Alesina & La Porta (2005)

Both papers begin their discussion sections by saying the evidence against racial diversity is mixed and that policies of racial homogenization are undesirable in both the short and long run.  The blog post/podcast straight up misrepresents the findings of W&O, and pick a bizarre theoretical finding from A&LaP that hurts their overall claim (going from no ethnic heterogeneity to no ethnic homogeneity only reduces growth by 2%).

&#x200B;

2.) Empirical Papers: Habyarimana et al (2007), Stazyk et al (2012), Parotta, et al (2014a)

More misrepresented findings here.  Habyarimana and co-authors' paper is an experimental (yay!) paper that examines behavior of various ethnic groups in cooperative games.  I actually love this one passage from the paper:

>*A major implication of our findings is that generating higher levels of public goods provision in diverse communities does not require the segregation of ethnic groups, as many preference-based or technology-based explanations might suggest.* ***Indeed, just the opposite may be needed: policies that promote repeated social interactions and the free flow of information across ethnic lines***.

Stazyk and co-authors find that increasing racial diversity in workplaces decreases productivity, but that decreased productivity goes away in the presence of effective diversity management programs.  Parotta's structural model assumes that workers have disutility from working with people of different ethnic groups (so racism, basically).

&#x200B;

There are others, but at this point, I'm tired, and this is effort-posty enough IMO.

&#x200B;

# 4.) Some Final Thoughts

I have no doubts that returns to diversity can be negative in the short run.  The U.S.'s painful experience with integration shows that.  The entry of women into the workforce during the 70s shows that.  However, to quote Alesina and La Porta ""The implication of promoting racial homogeneity is unappealing and probably incorrect both in the short and in the long run. "" My claim is that there is an underlying variable or variables that explains the negative relationship (inasmuch as it exists) between racial diversity and productivity or other economic outcomes.  Hence, policy prescriptions to address the ""costs"" of racial diversity should focus on the true culprit of its negative effects.",iamelben,t2_580t2,0.86,104,30

> Just for fucking fun I decided to recreate the chart in excel. The fucking r-squared is roughly 50%.

Before we get into it, for transparency's sake I should say that I have not read what the original thread is referring to substantively, so I can't comment on the study mentioned per se, this is purely a RI about R^2 .

Anyways, it is true that R^2 represents the amount of variance captured by your model (edited per /u/brberg’s comment below) but I have a few points about why this is not necessarily super important assuming you care about causality and not just prediction. I'm not going to go too in depth, just because I've discussed this throughout my comment history, but here we go:

* Want to get a high R^2 value? Just add more variables to your regression. (For this section, you can use [this](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php) to view the LaTeX equations, aka the stuff between dollar signs): That's because R^2 is just the residual sum of squares, `$\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(\hat{y}_i-\bar{y})^2$` divided by the total sum of squares, `$\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2$`, where we're talking about a dataset with n values marked indexed by i, associated with a predicted (or modeled) value y-hat. If you add more variables SSR is necessarily non-increasing, which is nicely explained [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/167827/why-is-sum-of-squared-residuals-non-increasing-when-adding-explanatory-variable). As a result, you really shouldn't be as concerned about the proportion of the variance in the outcome variable that is predictable from a single predictor... a lot of different things could affect your outcome, especially in the social sciences where units are highly heterogeneous. [Taken from an old comment of mine here](https://np.reddit.com/r/OpenEconomics/comments/a79oz9/update_on_lrnm_argument_the_honor_of_robert_lucas/ec1zy7z/).


* Ok you say, then just consider adjusted R^2 which penalizes for the extra terms you include in the regression. Well, you might be able to explain more variation, but if you're interested in causal inference then you have to be careful about including ""bad"" controls, aka conditioning on a collider. Consider [this example from another old comment about the gender pay gap](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/brzo5t/more_good_than_bad_kamala_harriss_equal_pay/eokmnte/). Guess which of the two models has a higher adjusted R^2 value? Hint: the wrong one! Also you might be overfitting, which the next point gets at.

> This is obviously an extraordinarily simplified example, but consider this data-generating process as a toy model of why controlling for A, B, C, and D, (or just A in this case) when said variables come downstream of the causal pathway is a bad idea. This was written in R, if you're familiar with the software.

    male <- rbinom(n=1000, size=1, prob=0.5)
    wages <-  2*male + rnorm(1000)
    hours_worked <- wages + rnorm(1000)
    
    lm(wages ~ male)
    lm(wages ~ male + hours_worked)

> There's a hardcoded gender wage gap of ""2"" here, and notice that wages are purely a function of gender (i.e. discrimination) and not hours worked. The second regression will produce a biased estimate of the effect of gender on wages (you will underestimate this effect). It does not mean it doesn't exist!

> Scott Cunningham, in pages 74-78 of his [book on causal inference](http://scunning.com/cunningham_mixtape.pdf) goes through this example as an example of collider bias and I think he does so quite nicely (plus, it's in Stata, if you're unfamiliar with R).

> Of course we don't know that this is the true data-generating process: the point is that just because the gender pay gap diminishes when we control for these sorts of variables does not mean that discrimination does not exist.

* [Here](https://twitter.com/nickchk/status/1191114004120264704) are some graphical examples about why higher values of R^2 could mean a worse model, from Nick Huntington-Klein's Twitter.

* And finally, [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/analisereal/status/1182738974604845056) makes these similar points nicely with a policy example:

> Imagine you are studying a population in which everyone has a very serious disease, except one person. Then, of course, you find that the disease explains little variation in happiness. Would you then conclude that the ""effects are too small to warrant policy change""? Surely not. The low ""variance explained"" is due to low variation in exposure, but the effect of an intervention could be huge. Thus, if screen time affects one's happiness substantially, but almost everyone in the population has the same exposure to screen time, then screen time will surely explain little variation in happiness, since there is low variation of the exposure to begin with.

---

I'm not saying R^2 doesn't matter or we should throw it away entirely. That said, in the social sciences [we should worry less about these values than in the hard sciences](https://np.reddit.com/r/OpenEconomics/comments/a79oz9/update_on_lrnm_argument_the_honor_of_robert_lucas/ec24bdc/). Why? 

Units are far more heterogenous in the social sciences! Every single carbon atom is the same, but every human is different. This is exactly why we have to use randomization to get at causality as opposed to being able to create a perfectly controlled environment like in the lab sciences.  /u/rationalities was [trying to make this same point in the original thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/ermg5c/explained_with_uncanny_accuracy_in_a_classic_meme/ffal6u2/). See also their point [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/esjiks/vat_is_always_paid_by_the_consumer_bonus_bad/ffbxang/). 

Social science outcomes are highly complex and have many causes, so it's unlikely that any particular model will be able to explain all of the variation in an outcome perfectly, or even above a certain threshold, especially when just using a single variable model. We have to work probabilistically, not deterministically.

So be wary of R^2, especially when the regression includes many predictors be sure to look at adjusted R^2 but even still, don't put so much weight on it if you care about causality. It may not matter anyway.

Note the scare quotes -- I'm not going to single out any one comment from that thread because I don't think any single comment rises to the level of badeconomics per se, but I think it will be useful for many of us to have some clarity in regards to the epistemological limits of empirical research. 

I will couch this discussion in terms of gender, but everything that follows is applicable to any situation in which we attempt to obtain causal estimates from observational data. 

---

## The causal effect of gender

Suppose we are interested in the effect that (biological) gender has on some outcome variable (let's specifically consider ""aggression,"" which is something that was mentioned more than once in the wage-gap thread). We are interested in the additional amount of aggression that one exhibits as a result of being a man as opposed to a female, on average. Symbolically, we are interested in discovering:

E(A^(M)|M) - E(A^(F)|M) = E(A^(M)-A^(F)|M),

where A^M is the aggression level of a man, and E is the [expected-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) operator (the mean). We can think of this expression as the average difference in aggression that we would expect to see if we changed someone from female to male (in economics this is called a ""~~local~~ average treatment effect""). The term E(A^(F)|M) indicates what level of aggression men would have on average if they were born a female (this is known as the ""counterfactual""). Obviously this is not something that we observe in the real world, so our goal as empiricists is to use data to make some kind of statement about the true (but unobserved!) value.

So we go out into the world and collect data on aggression levels by gender, then compare the means. Due to the [law of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), our sample will converge to the true population mean:

E(A^(M)|M) - E(A^(F)|F).

If we add and subtract the term E(A^(F)|M) and rearrange, we get:

E(A^(M)-A^(F)|M) + E(A^(F)|M) - E(A^(F)|F).

Our first term is the causal effect that we are trying to estimate. However, we are left with the additional expression E(A^(F)|M) - E(A^(F)|F). This expression (called ""selection bias"") is unobserved. The difference in aggression levels that we observe is a combination of the true causal effect of gender that we care about and an additional, unobserved component. To make a statement about the true value of our causal effect, we need to account for this unobserved influence.

---

## Randomization

In general, the best and most intuitive way to account for this unobserved bias is to randomize selection into the two groups. From our sample, we randomly draw some number of women who will then change their sex. Since this group was randomly selected, we would expect that any changes in aggression that we observe post sex change can be attributed solely to sex. 

In this instance, randomization is, of course, impossible. This means that we must find some other way to account for our unobserved selection bias. Absent randomization, however, we don't have any way to directly account for E(A^(F)|M) (the average aggression of females who are also men). We might be tempted to think about women who transition to become male, but this won't work because these women are likely different from women who don't transition along other dimensions (including aggression), and therefore our average will be skewed.

What we are left with, then, is an unobserved component that cannot be accounted for in the data. To make a statement about the causal effect of gender, we must make *untestable* assumptions about this unobserved value. If we believe that [testability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verificationism) is a fundamental property of science, then any statement we make about the causal effects of gender are necessarily unscientific.

---

## Omitted variable bias

Everything discussed so far can be translated into the standard OLS framework that we all learned in our undergraduate econometrics course. We are interested in estimating the equation 

A = a + bM + e,

where M is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the observation is male. We would like for our estimate of b to be an unbiased estimate of our causal effect of M on A. For this to be the case, however, we need to make the [standard assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares#Assumptions).

We know these assumptions are likely to be violated, however. Strict exogeneity isn't satisfied: there is a strong cultural component to gender that also affects behavior. This culture variable is therefore correlated with A and M. If it is omitted from our regression, then our estimate of b will be biased. 

This, unfortunately, is the most pernicious form of omitted variable bias that we can have. The cultural variable is positively correlated with male biology (boys are expected to be ""boys"") *and* is positively correlated with aggression (part of being a ""boy"" is being aggressive). We can therefore put a sign on the bias; our estimate of b is going to be larger than the true causal effect. If we observe a positive effect of M on A (men are more aggressive), we are unable to say *anything* about the *true* effect of M on A (other than that it is *smaller* than what we observe). In fact, the true effect could even be *negative* -- we are simply unable to make any sort of statistical claim about the true value. It doesn't matter how large an effect we see, or how often we see it; the data do not allow us to make any claim about the magnitude or direction of the true effect.

---

As was pointed out on the other wage-gap thread, everything I have said here also applies to identifying the causal effect of culture. But that's the point -- we can't separately identify the effects of culture from the effects of biology. None of this should be interpreted as saying ""biology doesn't matter,"" because that's committing the same mistake in the other direction. It's unverifiable, and as scientists we should therefore remain agnostic.

Situations like this are more common than any scientist would like to admit. However, failing to address these issues can lead to unscientific and unfounded inference on data. As scientists, we should remain vigilant against such scenarios and call attention to people drawing erroneous conclusions from bad data. ",bon_pain,t2_1522n3,0.9,58,63
710,56kvm0,2016-10-09,badeconomics,You gotta outline your assumptions mannnnn,"In this R1 I wish to critique two arguments I often see in Gender Wage Gap threads, because they are related to same point. 

First is when people claim that there, logically, cannot be a gender wage gap, because then firms would fire men and hire only women. This arbitrage will eliminate anything preventing wages from equaling marginal productivity (and therefore reflecting value added to the business).

Second is when people link to an audit study and act like that’s enough to prove discriminatory gap (it isn’t)

Both of these mistakes have the same root cause, which is assuming a structural model of the labor market, but rarely are they explicit about this.
 
I will **not** be claiming a particular structural model is more plausible than another or better fits the data. That is beyond my knowledge of the subject, if you have this knowledge, feel free to comment and add on. I just wish to highlight that both of these arguments are reliant on certain structural assumptions that are *rarely* stated.

___

First, let us consider a common claim , see [here]( https://np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/551qjo/how_to_eliminate_the_gender_wage_gap/d8704vl?context=3&st=iu23swy7&sh=8274a517).


>Easiest business plan ever for profits. Only hire women, at 77% the price. Free 23% profit, right?


Let’s talk about the simplest (not necessarily the most realistic) model that will make this argument true. This is Becker’s Taste for Discrimination + perfectly competitive labor markets.

In Becker’s taste for discrimination some firms don’t like hiring X group and pay them less and pocket the difference as compensation for dealing with this group that they don’t like to hire. This means that discrimination will be affected through a market process. 

See [relevant Heckman]( http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.12.2.101)

>The impact of market discrimination is not determined by the most discriminatory participants in the market, or even by the average level of discrimination among firms, but rather by the level of discrimination at the firms where ethnic minorities or women actually end up buying, working and borrowing. It is at the margin that economic values are set. This point is largely ignored in the papers in this symposium.

Basically what Heckman means here is it doesn’t matter if the average firm is a discriminator, it matters if the firm that hires the minority is a discriminator. The reasoning is actually very similar to why marginal costs matter much more than average costs. 
This marginal firm leads us to two important conclusions about the labor market for the group we are looking at. 

If

1.	There are not enough non-discriminatory firms to hire all the group members

2.	 The group members cannot easily find these non-discriminatory firms

We will likely see a wage gap. Fortunately in this one, we have assumed option 2 away because we have perfectly competitive labor markets. The group’s members know exactly how many openings non-discriminatory firms offer, because of perfect information. 

So let’s focus on 1. If there are enough firms in the industry to employ all this disadvantaged group, we will see no wage gap. It doesn’t matter if discriminatory firms exist, the group will be able to avoid them easily. If a firm offers discriminatory wages and someone takes it, they will be offered scooped up by the non-discriminatory firm. These discriminatory wage gaps will not exist in equilibrium. This seems to basically be the argument presented above (but not really fleshed out).

If there aren’t enough non-discriminatory firms, things get more dicey. The group will be forced to take jobs at discriminatory firms. Furthermore, even nondiscriminatory firms will pay lower wages. This is because they can take this disadvantaged group from these discriminatory firms, so if they paid wages = marginal product, they could fire there current workers and hire from the worker pool at discriminatory firms. This will grant these firms economic profits. 

If we have free entry (another assumption) and the firms entering with free entry aren’t discriminators (another assumption), we will see non-discriminators drive out discriminators. Essentially, the fact they *don’t* have a discriminatory preferences gives them a competitive advantage, much like them being a firm with say, more efficient technology. They can hire labor cheaper.

If we don’t have free entry and not enough non-discriminatory firms, or the firms entering are discriminators, then we will see a wage gap. Competition will not eliminate the wage gap. Strangely enough, this case is actually perfectly efficient. This is because preferences are exogenous, much like the weather. I think it is often underappreciated how odd exogenous preferences is as an assumption at times.

Finally, I will note that relaxing 2 can lead to a mess. Even if there are enough non-discriminatory firms, non-discriminators will know that marginalized groups have less bargaining power and will, for profit seeking reasons, offer them less. For example, marginalized groups could face more stringent search frictions (e.g. they have a harder time finding a firm without a taste for discrimination) and firms could know they have more leverage over them as a result and offer them less money, even though they have no taste for discrimination themselves. There are lots of ways we could go with this and maybe you could add other features that counter act these factors and reduce/eliminate the wage gap. However, my point still stands that you need to specifically outline these features, not claim it’s logically incoherent for there to be a wage gap.

Next I will go after the citations I see of audit studies where it is found that the average firm is a discriminator. I actually think many of these are correct and the average firm *is* a discriminator. However, this brings us back to the marginal firm vs. average firm problem.

Heckman again

> The impact of market discrimination is not determined by the most discriminatory participants in the market, or even by the average level of discrimination among firms, but rather by the level of discrimination at the firms where ethnic minorities or women actually end up buying, working and borrowing. It is at the margin that economic values are set. This point is largely ignored in the papers in this symposium.

This is why I lumped them together. The problem is these audit studies (say, comparing resumes that are the same except for the race of the applicant). They cannot tell us how easily the applicant can *dodge* discrimination. Sure, marginalized groups may be less likely to get interviews and jobs, but if they can still find those non-discriminatory jobs, they won’t have a discriminatory gap.

To use an extreme example, I may have 100 job offers, 99 will give me a discriminator gap and 1 does not. I will not actually suffer from discrimination.*

*I don’t find this plausible. More accurately, I’d worry audit studies might overstate discrimination, by not factoring in marginalized groups ability to dodge discrimination. (If anyone has evidence that this is or is not happening, please post it)


These groups being able to dodge it easily will be reliant on no search frictions and having enough non-discriminatory employers, for the as reasons I mentioned about.

____

All in all, I suspect both sides are reliant on more assumptions than I outlined (I mentioned mostly perfectly competitive labor markets and only one type of discrimination). However, I wanted to focus on the \# of non-discriminatory firms and how easily marginalized groups can find them, because those are key structural parameters that most of these arguments completely ignore. It’s not that these arguments are wrong per se, it’s that they are incomplete.

Because women have access to the birth control pill now and can compete in the same domains as men roughly speaking there is a real practical problem here. It's partly an economic problem now because **when I was roughly your age, it was still possible for a one-income family to exist. Well you know that wages have been flat except in the upper 1% since 1973. Why? Well, it's easy. What happens when you double the labor force? What happens? You halve the value of the labor. So now we're in a situation where it takes two people to make as much as one did before. So we went from a situation where women's career opportunities were relatively limited to where there they were relatively unlimited and there were two incomes (and so women could work) to a situation where women have to work and they only make half as much as they would have otherwise.** Now we're going to go in a situation—this is the next step—where women will work because men won't. And that's what's coming now. There was an Economist article showing that 50% now of boys in school are having trouble with their basic subject. Look around you in universities—you can see this happening. I've watched it over decades. I would say 90% of the people in my personality class are now women. There won't be a damn man left in university in ten years except in the STEM fields. And it's a complete bloody catastrophe.

712,597wqm,2016-10-25,badeconomics,Hillary's Economically Clueless Plans Will Create Poverty,"So, [this] (https://fee.org/articles/hillarys-economically-clueless-plans-will-create-poverty/) article is a ‘fisking’ of Clinton’s economic plan meant to show how, as the title suggests, Clinton will create poverty. This article was written by an actual economist (though the fact that he has elected to work with highly conservative think tanks and tends towards more politics than economics says a lot) who resorts to calling Clinton and the OECD and basically anyone he politically disagrees with ‘statists’.

However, not only is there never an argument made about how Clinton would increase poverty (besides some insinuation about the minimum wage), the short spurts of analysis he deems fit to provide are riddled with bad assumptions and misleading applications of statistics. I am going to focus mainly on the claims that he puts some substance into, because this article covers a lot of different subjects.

After getting past the first few paragraphs which are used to basically show how *ridiculous* statists are, he gets into the actual economics.

> A laudable sentiment, for sure, but it’s important at this point to ask what is meant by “poverty.” If we’re talking about wretched material deprivation, what’s known as “absolute poverty,” then we have good news. Virtually nobody in the United States is in that tragic category (indeed, one of great success stories in recent decades is that fewer and fewer people around the world endure this status).
But if we’re talking about the left’s new definition of poverty (promoted by the statists at the OECD), which is measured relative to a nation’s median level of income, then you can have “poverty” even if nobody is poor.


While not technically wrong that you could have poverty without ‘true’ poverty, it seems disingenuous to imply that because there is no “absolute poverty” in the US, there is no poverty at all. Poverty looks different in different countries and what makes you poor in India does not make you poor in America. Poverty is measured not only in strictly how much money you make, but also by what you can purchase with that money and how that compares to your country’s standard of living. 

The US has ~~one of the worst child poverty rates in the developed world~~  and [17% of households with children experience food insecurity] (http://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/impact-of-hunger/hunger-and-poverty/hunger-and-poverty-fact-sheet.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/).

Saying that just because almost no one in the US makes less than 2 dollars a day that we shouldn't worry about poverty is a farce.

Note: The OECD measure of poverty is definitely flawed as rightly pointed out in the comments, but seems to [line up](http://www.nccp.org/topics/childpoverty.html) with federal government estimates which use an absolute line (although it does overestimate it). Furthermore, an [OECD report](https://www.oecd.org/els/family/43570328.pdf) taking a multi-dimensional approach to child well being similarly finds the US lacking, meaning that efforts aimed at improving child welfare in this country are not without merit as the author seems to be suggesting.

> If Obama gets credit for the good numbers of 2015, then shouldn’t he be blamed for the bad numbers between 2009-2014? Shouldn’t it matter that there are still more people in poverty in 2015 than there were in 2008? And is it really good news that it’s taken Obama so long to finally get median income above the 2008 level, particularly when you see how fast income grew during the Reagan boom?

For someone calling out misleading statistics he seems to have a penchant for them.

Even if there are more people in poverty, the percentage of people poor or near poor in 2015 is the exact same as it was in 2008 (table 6 from [here] (http://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-people.html)).

Also, median income per household (when adjusting for number of household members) is now the highest it has been since before the tech bubble burst and arguably the [highest ever] (http://imgur.com/XW78Qqc) (and this is not even counting the variety of [other reasons] (http://www.vox.com/2016/9/15/12915038/census-income-report) why census numbers on income growth understate it).

This all of course is ignoring the fact that putting the 2009-2010 numbers on Obama when they were results of the Great Recession, which was unequivocally not his fault, is absurd. When looking at the past 3 or so years, his administration seems more culpable but even then president's do not have an overwhelming impact on economic policy and much of the blame/ subsequent adulation should go towards the Fed.

Reagan era economic policy has its own problems. Reagan came into office facing huge (by American standards) inflation and initially passed  huge tax cuts for the upper brackets to spur growth. 

However, this did not create a recovery until around the time Reagan was forced to roll back many of the cuts, coincidentally around the same time that Volcker, arguably the true 'savior' of the economy, was able to tame inflation so he could stop hitting the economy with negative demand shocks, allowing for a rapid recovery.

Furthermore, the growth rate experienced after this recovery of was not atypical and in fact were similar to the growth rates during the post-70's recession boom.

Obama faced a different task altogether; instead of facing inflation, which we can deal with (although not super easily), he instead faced the collapse of much of the financial sector while interest rates/inflation was very low, and his reaction accordingly was very different than Reagan's.

Obama faced a demand driven recession while we were at the ZLB, giving him significantly fewer options to deal with the recession, and even then the US recovery outperformed most other nations. While GDP growth has been anemic, it has also trended downwards over time since at least the 70's (and this is a pattern most developed countries seem to be following). Job and wage growth however have ended up being pretty good.

Lastly, just like to add that Obama's flagship economic policy, the 'bailout', is [overwhelmingly supported by economists.] (http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_0qeKwxLWkDyiwjX)

> The comment about equal pay sounds noble, though I strongly suspect it is based on dodgy data and that she really favors the very dangerous idea of “comparable worth” legislation, which would lead to bureaucrats deciding the value of jobs.

Here he links to [his own blog post about the subject] (https://danieljmitchell.wordpress.com/2015/04/15/equal-pay-day-economic-illiteracy-and-hillary-hypocrisy/), and you can refer to any of the many great posts made in this sub about why this 'debunking' of the gender pay gap is wrong, but the thrust of the argument is

1. Holding a bunch of variables constant to explain away the gap gives you a misleading answer because the things you are holding constant is what is causing the gap in the first place (and seem to be caused by societal norms that negatively impact women, i.e. sexism). Pre-market discrimination is still discrimination, and even then when you control for these variables a (small) [gender gap still emerges] (http://www.hawaii.edu/religion/courses/Gender_Wage_Gap_Report.pdf).

2. Saying that businesses should just hire women and reap the profits of cheap labor seems to miss that discrimination is 

a) a preference firms choose to pay for, 

b) this assumes free entry for non-discriminatory (or less discriminatory) firms, 

c) assumes those discriminated against have perfect information and can find the non-discriminatory firms without cost, and 

d) the average amount of discrimination is not the same as the marginal amount of discrimination.

>That minimum wage would do absolutely nothing to businesses. History has proven that the implementation of a minimum wage and subsequent increases have not caused job losses whatsoever.

So, he's either being slippery or doesn't understand the implications of a minimum wage rise fully. The issue with raising the minimum wage is not just the *level* of employment--not just whether employed people today will be unemployed tomorrow--but the effect on future employment growth, or whether somebody doesn't get a job when they otherwise might've done. 

Of course, we can't discuss the minimum wage and its effects without mentioning the 2006 [Neumark and Wascher](http://www.nber.org/papers/w12663) meta-analysis. But, perhaps something more recent would be better: [Dube](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2014/06/19_hamilton_policies_addressing_poverty/state_local_minimum_wage_policy_dube.pdf) finds that the disemployment effects of a $15/hr would likely outweigh the welfare gain of those remaining in employment. 

>Corporate profits are so high these days

As far as I know, this is also [false](http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Decoupling-of-wages-and-productivity.pdf), provided you aren't using a completely insignificant length of time. Over the past few decades, capital's share of income has remained pretty stable, with a probably transitory rise post-2001 due to the housing sector.

>therefore helping boost consumption and aggregate demand in an economy

I don't have any literature, but I'm thinking the whole ""raising the minimum wage will boost AD"" argument has very little credence. Especially during a recession, for the same reason countercyclical tax breaks don't really work.

>Considering the amount of advanced economies that don't have tuition fees

As HE3 quite recently mentioned, countries that pull this off--like Germany--usually just flat out bar half the population from ever getting a degree. I really don't trust the US--or UK--political system to maintain such a level of discipline.

>but it still needs to be sorted out

Given that most of the discrepancy in earnings between men and women is down to lifestyle choices made by free individuals, there is absolutely nothing to sort out (well, not quite, making postnatal parental leave shareable is something which could be done). Claiming to want equality of opportunity and then using metrics for parity is ridiculous. 

EDIT: I unconsciously tailored this response to the poster, who is indeed a proponent of the 'discrimination' hypothesis of the wage gap.

Of course, neoliberalism is tricky to either attack or defend, but specifically he is targeting low-wage jobs created in the global economy through trade, as implied in the image, so we'll stick to that.

Consider the [big picture:](https://fee.org/articles/were-seeing-massive-reductions-in-global-poverty/)

> Only since about 1970 has there been a rapid growth in the number of people living above the extreme poverty line and a drastic reduction in the number of people living under it. In 1970, about 60 percent of the 3.7 billion people living on this planet were still relegated to extreme poverty. Now, the figure is under 9 percent.

If the ""neoliberalism"" of the past half century was supposed to keep people in poverty, it's terrible at its job.  But as it is, there's in fact a strong [correlation](https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/ib/2001/110801.htm#ii) between liberalizing trade and this sharp decline in poverty:

> Opening up their economies to the global economy has been essential in enabling many developing countries to develop competitive advantages in the manufacture of certain products. In these countries, defined by the World Bank as the ""new globalizers,"" the number of people in absolute poverty declined by over 120 million (14 percent) between 1993 and 1998.

[And:](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/trade/publication/the-role-of-trade-in-ending-poverty)

> A dramatic increase in developing country participation in trade has coincided with an equally sharp decline in extreme poverty worldwide. Developing countries now constitute 48 percent of world trade, up from 33 percent in 2000, and the number of people living in extreme poverty has been cut in half since 1990, to just under one billion people. Trade has helped increase the number and quality of jobs in developing countries, stimulated economic growth, and driven productivity increases.

The evidence is pretty clear that trade helps the conditions of the poor by growing the economy.  Harvard economist Dani Rodrik [puts it plainly:](https://www.oecd.org/derec/unitedkingdom/40700982.pdf)

> Historically nothing has worked better than economic growth in enabling societies to improve the life chances of their members, including those at the very bottom.

And even while increased trade, openness, etc. are heralded as proven methods for growth, the paper points out that these aren't magic bullets that automatically right every wrong:

> The institutional context is perhaps the single most important factor in determining whether a given policy will be appropriate or not. 

The user might be interested to know that Rodrik also [criticizes](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/14/the-fatal-flaw-of-neoliberalism-its-bad-economics) the idea of neoliberalism, when it is taken to mean nothing but deregulation/less government.  We can allow nuance, despite the strong evidence favoring trade.

To get more specific, let's compare wage growth for women in the U.S. with women in India, where it appears the pictured women are working.  In the [U.S.:](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/real-u-s-wage-growth-led-by-women-over-last-four-decades)

> Weekly pay for women working full-time has increased almost 24 percent over the last four decades, compared with a 6.1 percent decline for men. 

Compare this with an article *lamenting* that wage growth in India has *only* doubled in *two* decades:

> Even though the GDP rose fourfold in 1993-2012, wages only doubled during the given period, the report said. The estimates by NSSO also hint that the real average daily wage has doubled between the period 1993—94 and 2011—12. For workers in rural areas, casual workers, female workers and low paid employees, wages have moved up faster during the period. However, huge disparities remain.

So women are improving at [faster rates than men in India:](https://www.firstpost.com/business/low-pay-wage-inequality-persist-in-india-despite-gdp-growth-women-earn-less-than-men-in-every-category-report-5053301.html)

> While women’s daily wages may have increased more rapidly than men’s between 1993-94 and 2011-12, female workers are still paid lower wages than men in each employment category, according to NSSO data.

As these articles make clear, we can lament the situation of women around the world, and the failures to fight inequality and discrimination, while also recognizing that the improvement of the globally poor women has increased at a much more rapid rate than either global men, or women in the U.S.  The data clearly contradict the comment's assertion that neoliberalism only helps the privileged, and does nothing for globally poor women - if we understand neoliberalism to represent the jobs and trade portrayed in the image.  

The evidence shows that in **absolute** terms women in poor countries lag behind other groups substantially, but in terms of **growth**, or as the comment says, ""difference in the conditions,"" global women outpace everyone, and trade (neoliberalism, if you will) is a big reason why.

The ironic core of this comment is that his own privilege is precisely why he fails to see that $1/hr could possibly be a good opportunity for these women.  

His privilege blinds him to the unsoundness of even his moral argument: if you paid workers more, you would have to hire fewer.  Let's say we pay each woman $15/hr.   Let's say even corporate leadership supports this idea.  But we are still in a moral dilemma: instead of paying one woman $15/hr, why shouldn't we instead hire 15 women and pay them $1/hr?  That $1/hr seems small to us, but it could mean the difference between living in the street, prostitution, a terrible arranged marriage, or any other much worse fate.  But no no no, let's not allow these women to decide to take a job - some guy across the ocean thinks the wages are too low, so those 14 women will have to remain jobless!  

The ""vulnerabilities"" faced by these women are precisely the lack of freedom they have in forging their own path in life.  Taking a job to support themselves - no matter how meagerly - provides that freedom, at least in part.

As [Krugman](https://slate.com/business/1997/03/in-praise-of-cheap-labor.html) puts it:

> The lofty moral tone of the opponents of globalization is possible only because they have chosen not to think their position through. While fat-cat capitalists might benefit from globalization, the biggest beneficiaries are, yes, Third World workers.

The moral message is clear - we should radically redistribute wealth to help those in need.  I agree.  But I get the impression that the socialists of today, or of any time, don't care so much about helping the poor as they do about sticking it to the rich.

##Introduction

Before I begin, a special shoutout to u/besttrousers for pointing me to a [twitter thread of economists also R1ing Ben](https://twitter.com/besttrousers/status/1162016390309699590). I will be using it thoughout this R1.. As many of you know, Ben Shapiro is a neoconservative pundit who is quite active on Twitter as well as hosting the podcast “The Ben Shapiro Show” by The Daily Wire. Many young conservatives who listen to the likes of Jordan Peterson, Charlie Kirk, Steven Crowder, etc love Ben Shapiro and his *incredibly* nuanced takes on the world. 

##The Bad Economics

[A viral clip of Ben speaking about poor people circulated the tweet-o-sphere recently](https://twitter.com/JasonSCampbell/status/1161679740354387969). If you do not wish to listen to the entire clip here is it transcribed:

>	...Well, the fact is that, if you had to work more than one job to have a roof over you head or food on the table, you probably shouldn’t have taken the job that’s not paying you enough. That’d be a you problem. Also, it is not true that the vast majority of people in the United States are working two jobs, it just is not true. According to the Census statistics, “a small but steady number of American workers have more than one job, either because they need extra income, or because they want to gain more experience or explore different interests.” There’s a recently released US Census Bureau report, and apparently what it found is that approximately 8.3%, this is as of 2013, so it’s actually lower now, 8.3% of workers had more than one job. That was as of 2013, it’s a lot lower now. So this notion that there’s tons and tons of people who are working multiple jobs, it is not really true. It is not actually the reality. In May, 5% of American’s had multiple jobs, 5%. That’s really what is bringing down the unemployment rate, is those 5% of workers who work multiple jobs? For all of the talk about people working at Uber, it’s held to that range actually, really since 2009, it’s always been a very very low number, so this again is just a lie. It is also this bizarre idiocy that you dictate to the economy, what the economy ought to do. Every time everybody tries to dictate to the economy, what it ought to do, the economy fights back, because turns out, the aggregate knowledge of the market economy knows more than you do, I know, shocking.

There is quite a bit going on here, so I’m going to split it up and synthesize it into a few claims that I will then examine. 

##”That’d be a you problem”

What Ben is essentially claiming here is, if you are poor, or need more than one job to pay for necessary goods, that is your fault. What Ben is saying is that workers have incredible amounts of market power and should be able to either 1) select jobs that pay them a wage sufficient for this basket of necessary goods, or 2) demand wages sufficient for this basket of necessary goods. So, with such an outlandish claim, all that’s really necessary is for us to find cases where workers don’t have total market power, and maybe, we can find cases where *firms* actually have market power. 

First of all, let us consider a perfectly competitive labor market: wages are set by supply and demand and neither labor nor firms have wage setting power. If we relax that assumption and, say introduce labor market frictions i.e. there are no hitches or interruptions in the flow of labor from one job to the next, it is plausible that small wage cuts will not cause workers to leave a firm, therefore a firm gains market power in the labor markets and gain wage setting powers. This is monopsony power. Even if there is more than one firm hiring for the same job, firms can still have monopsony power (and yes we all know that mono means one. So, what frictions might there be in the labor market? As we know from [Stigler, 1961](https://home.uchicago.edu/~vlima/courses/econ200/spring01/stigler.pdf) search costs can create wide disparities in price (aka wages) between 2 goods. He then goes on to demonstrate that [lack of information causes employers to pay different wage rates or go through more costly search procedures (Stigler, 1962)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1829106.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Aaedfa79c2e92539e3daf1bdd7eeb74b7). Other frictions might be the result of labor immobility with Hseih and Moretti finding that [wages might be decreased by $1.27T annually](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/chang-tai.hsieh/research/growth.pdf). There is evidence that in some cases, [wages are below MPL, largely due to monopsony power](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26101.pdf). Our resident MinWage homie Dube also found [substantial separation and hiring elasticities in certain labor markets](https://escholarship.org/content/qt27z0006g/qt27z0006g.pdf) meaning that switching jobs just ain’t that easy. Unfortunately for Ben, there seems to be plenty of evidence that labor does *not* have overwhelming wage setting powers. 

Just as a quick aside, even Adam Smith believed that firms tended to have some power in labor markets (Wealth of Nations):

>	In the long-run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him; but the necessity is not so immediate. 

##How many people???

[For reference, this is the census data that Ben is referencing](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2019/demo/P70BR-163.pdf). He is correct, when he states that it is 8.3% of workers who are working multiple jobs. But then he goes on to say that it isn’t “tons and tons of people”. Doing some back of the napkin math all rounding down for convenience, in [December of 2013, there were 155M people in the labor force](http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/laus/us/usadj.htm). Rounding down again, 8% of that is a little more than 12M people. Now for some cheekier math. [The median age of the labor force is around 40 y/o](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/median-age-labor-force.htm), and [males in the US typically weigh more than 195lbs while females typically weigh 170lbs](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm). If we take 6M males x 195 + 6M females x 170lbs we get more than **2 billion** lbs of people or 1 million tons of people. I would say that this is tons and tons of people. Back on point, more than 12 million American workers working multiple jobs is not an insignificant number. It is roughly the population of NYC and LA combined.

To discuss the rest of the data, [the rest of this thread](https://twitter.com/inclusionist/status/1161731950455005185?s=20
) does a very good job explaining that, Ben’s numbers illustrating a decline come from a completely different sample source, as well as that survey undercounting multiple job withholding. 

Sidenote, I find it interesting that he opted for the Census data, rather than the Fed data, which would have served to [strengthen his point more](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=oEv0) and show a trend. But alas, we know that Ben isn’t super well known for his statistical rigor. Or any rigor for that matter. 
___
In sum, Ben’s comments really generated a lot of outrage amongst politicians, economists, and the public alike. Largely because he insinuated that the poor are poor due to their own machinations. Logically this is so strange anyways. “People have power in labor markets to set their own wages, but they choose to be poor”, is the strangest way to assign blame to poor people for being poor. Economically, this argument has no proof, and has plenty of proof going the opposite direction.

PS: I am a poor undergrad writing his first R1, plz be nice to me. 

Edit to address some common comments: 

> You are missing Ben's point, he is really telling people to acquire marketable skills

No he isn't. It is quicker and more economically correct to say ""The best way to earn more money is to try and gain marketable skills"". Plus, I have heard him say things like this. I have been listening to his podcast for a while and when he has straight up told people to get STEM degrees and other marketable degrees word for word. This is a completely different tone and word choice from him. 

> People should move, or do XYZ to earn more money.

This isn't a bad idea in a perfectly competitive labor market, but moving or XYZ doesn't solve the problem of monopsony power

> Muh supply and demand...muh free markets

719,5ecr81,2016-11-22,badeconomics,AMC price discriminates.,"OP has kind of stated the truth here, but I think he means that it will be bad for AMC to raise prices, which is bad econ. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/5dz2z8/after_amc_announced_tickets_to_blockbuster_movies/

OP states that AMC will charge more for better movies and this will cause people to pirate them more. Taking this at face value, it is a true statement. Popular movies will more often be pirated because the marginal benefit of finding a pirated movie would increase as the movie becomes better/more popular. If price is increased more people will find it beneficial to pirate vs pay as well.

However, I think OP means that AMC should not charge more for popular movies because they will lose money because people will just pirate. There exists a price where this would be true. As the price of a movie P_m  get sufficiently high, nobody would be willing to buy it and only people who gained enough utility from watching the movie would invest the cost of pirating C_p. This RI will not be an econometric analysis of movie price elasticity, instead it will only prove that it will be profit maximizing for AMC to charge a higher price for a better product, given certain, easily met assumptions. 

**Monopoly situation**
Monopolies set revenue equal to marginal cost. The profit function for AMC is given by 𝜋=P_m(X_i-𝜇*P_m-σ*P_m*i). Where 𝜇 is the amount that consumers will stop watching any AMC movies at the margin and σ amount of people who chose to pirate at a given price. In this example we will set MC to zero but it would still hold if MC>0. X_g = the good movies and X_m = mediocre movies. i= the modifier on the amount increase people will pirate better movies where i=g,1 and g>1.

∂π/∂P_m=X_i-2µ*P_m-2σP_m*i=0

P_m=X_i/(2μ+2σi)

**Good movie:**
P_m=X_g/(2μ+2σg)

**Mediocre movie:**
P_m=X_m/(2μ+2σ)

Here is where the most controversial assumption comes into effect. Number of pirates = σ*P_m*i is a linear function such that number of people who will pirate a movie depends on that movie's price and the quality. Since better quality movies do better at the box office at the same price, the increase in piracy as i goes from 1 to g must be less than the increase in X_m to X_g. 

Since X_g>X_m and the increase in piracy for good movies is not enough to make them less profitable that mediocre movies, P_m must be greater for good movies. Therefore, a monopolist would be better off increasing the price a small amount for a good movie, despite the increased amount of piracy. 

**Competitiveive Market**

In this case, price=cost. We assume that directors/CGI artists etc that are good charge a higher price. Therefore, the cost of a good movie would be higher and firms would charge more.

**Analysis**

I highly doubt AMC want's more people to pirate their movies, but they will take an increase in piracy and still profit maximize at a higher price. ",kaiser_xc,t2_8gunm,0.8,15,4

[Imgur link in case that thread gets deleted](https://i.imgur.com/uZyQdLF.png).

There are an impressive number of things that are wrong in a tweet less than 100 characters long. For one thing, race is not the same thing as nationality. ""Native born American"" is not a synonym for ""white people."" Most minorities in this country are native born Americans! Looking at native born Americans tells you nothing about race. 

The relevant data points will come from the [Current Population Survey in table H-5](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-households.html): 

Race| Household Median Income in 2018
---|---
White | $66,943
White Non-Hispanic | $70,642
Black| $41,361

For black immigrants, we'll need to look at the American Community Survey. [Pew has some tables constructed from the ACS data](https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2020/08/20/facts-on-u-s-immigrants-previous-years-data/). In 2017 median household income for foreign-born Americans from Sub-Saharan Africa was $52,730. Note that this is even lower than the US-born statistic of $60,000 so even if you ignore the conflation of nationality and race, his claim is still just wrong for most African-born Americans. 

On the other hand, it is true that Nigerian born Americans are very successful (median household income of about $65,000 according to ACS, which is still less than white non-hispanic households), but this immigrant group is unusual because they disproportionately come here under family reunification programs. [Chikanda and Morris 20](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19376812.2020.1744455?journalCode=rafg20):

>There are significant differences in the class of entry of immigrants from different African
countries such as Nigeria and Somalia. **Among the Nigerian-born immigrants, the most popular
classes of entry between 1997 and 2017 were as immediate relatives of US citizens (133,372 or
56.7%), the diversity program (53,550 or 22.7%), and family-sponsored preferences (24,697 or
10.6%)** (Figure 3). On the contrary, the overwhelming majority of Somali-born immigrants entered
as refugees and asylees (96,150 or 85.2%) and immediate relatives of US relatives (12,549 or 11.1%).
Thus, **the overwhelming majority of Nigerian-born immigrants who have entered the US in the past
two decades have done so under programs that encourage family reunification** while Somali-born
immigrants have entered through various humanitarian programs. 

This has clear implications on economic assimilation. If you are related to a U.S. citizen you are far more likely to speak English, benefit from an established social network, and be able to resettle to high-productivity metropolitan areas of the country. The relative success of Nigerian Americans is not evidence of a lack of discrimination, rather it is the product of the kinds of Nigerians that are allowed to immigrate to this country. It's quite possible this group faces discrimination as well but we wouldn't see it in the data without more careful research approaches. 

Finally, reducing racism to a solely class-based lens is grossly myopic. Black Americans are victims of disproportionate [police brutality](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/if2w88/the_brutalist_housing_block_sticky_come_shoot_the/g2rt166/), over-incarceration, and [prison violence](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2013/10/24/shame-our-prisons-new-evidence/).

721,a7nem8,2018-12-19,badeconomics,Mike Lee and Zero Sum Games,"Very quick RI:

President Trump recently renominated Chai Feldblum, an Obama appointee, to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Senator Mike Lee is putting a hold on her nomination, citing her views on LGBT issues, and suggesting that presents a threat to religious liberty. You can read his editorial here: https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/02/14/trump-should-withdraw-nominee-would-oppose-religious-liberty/

Let's not go into the broader culture wars in BE. However, I have a specific issue with the op-ed. I don't think Senator Lee understands what ""zero sum"" means. He's simply using it as a scare quotes term.


> “The [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] has jurisdiction only over employment,” Feldblum told the Washington Blade in 2015. “But other federal agencies that enforce sex discrimination provisions often look to our interpretation for guidance in interpreting the laws they enforce.”

> And don’t think for a second that you, your family, and your neighbors will be left alone if Feldblum gets her way. Feldblum has described modern-day politics as a “zero-sum game,” where rights for LGBT Americans are secured only by curtailing the rights of religious Americans.

> …

> As the Supreme Court acknowledges, America’s tradition of religious freedom embraces all. Rather than a “zero-sum game” that pits Americans against each other, we should work to build an America where “all possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship,” as George Washington wrote in 1790.

Saying that there is a ""zero sum conflict"" between LGBT people and religious Americans has a specific meaning. It's not saying that people are necessarily pitted against each other - it means that when we make policies decisions - especially about conflicting liberties - we should recognize that moving the line one way or another may harm the other group.

This is very clear in the [source of the zero sum quote](https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&context=facpub), a 2006 law review article.

> Ensuring that LGBT people can live honestly and safely in all
aspects of their social lives requires that society set a baseline
of non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and
gender identity. If individual business owners, service
providers and employers could easily exempt themselves from
such laws by making credible claims that their belief liberty is
burdened by the law, LGBT people would remain constantly
vulnerable to surprise discrimination. If I am denied a job, an
apartment, a room at a hotel, a table at a restaurant or a
procedure by a doctor because I am a lesbian, that is a deep,
intense and tangible hurt. That hurt is not alleviated because I
might be able to go down the street and get a job, an
apartment, a hotel room, a restaurant table or a medical
procedure from someone else. The assault to my dignity and
my sense of safety in the world occurs when the initial denial
happens. That assault is not mitigated by the fact that others
might not treat me in the same way. 

> Thus, for all my sympathy for the evangelical Christian
couple who may wish to run a bed and breakfast from which
they can exclude unmarried, straight couples and all gay
couples, this is a point where I believe the ""zero-sum"" nature of
the game inevitably comes into play. And, in making the
decision in this zero-sum game, I am convinced society should
come down on the side of protecting the liberty of LGBT people.
Once individuals choose to enter the stream of economic
commerce by opening commercial establishments, I believe it is
legitimate to require that they play by certain rules. **If the government tolerated the private exclusionary policies of such
individuals in the commercial sector, such toleration would
necessarily come at the cost of gay people's sense of belonging
and safety in society.** Just as we do not tolerate private racial
beliefs that adversely affect African-Americans in the
commercial arena, even if such beliefs are based on religious
views, we should similarly not tolerate private beliefs about
sexual orientation and gender identity that adversely affect
LGBT people.

> **But that is not to say that we should not acknowledge
that this zero-sum game has resulted in a burden on some
individuals' belief liberty and that we not be forced to
articulate why such a burden is appropriate.** A government's
reasons for burdening liberty should be, as Professor Rebecca
Brown argues, ""accessible to all in a meaningful sense.""
Brown defines these as reasons that ""have some public and
secular component to them and [do] not rest entirely on
personal moral belief systems not universally shared."" While
I am not sure I would use Brown's formulation of a ""personal
moral belief system not universally shared,"" I do believe that
the reasons given by the State must ""reflect the public good. ""
And ensuring that members of the public who have a morally
neutral characteristic are able to live without fear or
vulnerability of discrimination based on that characteristic
certainly seems to be a reason that reflects the public good. 

To take specific cases likely to come up to the EEOC: Should firms have the right to refuse to employ LGBT people? Or should LGBT people have the right to non-discrimination in employment? As far as I can tell, this is a zero sum game - bargaining over where the line should be drawn.

722,o4orjq,2021-06-21,badeconomics,R1: Increasing the number of unsolicited d*** pics DOES NOT decrease the cost of d***.,"I will be shocked if the mods allow this to stay up, even though I censored everything, so here we go:

**Overview of the Tweet**

I found this [tweet](https://twitter.com/milfweeed/status/1406003917306044421) from MILFWEEED, who stated the following:

>Fellas when you send unsolicited d\*\*\* pics you're driving the cost of d\*\*\* down. In a capitalistic market you're providing too much d\*\*\* to the consumers and they don't want it. we need d\*\*\* SCARCITY to create d\*\*\* DEMAND

There are several issues with this statement. Given that she says ""capitalistic market"", I am going to assume she meant perfect competition for the first part of this R1.

First:

>Fellas when you send unsolicited d\*\*\* pics you're driving the cost of d\*\*\* down.

If we are to assume perfect competition, increasing the supply of d\*\*\* pics would lead to a **decrease** in the **market price** of d\*\*\* pics, not a decrease to the cost of d\*\*\*s in general. ~~I would generally assume that the production of d\*\*\*s to be costless anyways.~~ The supply of d\*\*\*s is fixed and the production of additional units would be quite costly. @Katholikos points out that it takes 9 months to create a d\*\*\* and >50% of the time a d\*\*\* is not produced. Moreover, if we are to follow the law, then it will take another 18 years for the d\*\*\* to be matured enough for pictures.

Second:

>In a capitalistic market you're providing too much d\*\*\* to the consumers and they don't want it.

Under perfect competition, the number of d\*\*\* pics affects the **market price**, not the value (or utility) received for the d\*\*\* pics.

Third:

>we need d\*\*\* SCARCITY to create d\*\*\* DEMAND

Scarcity of d\*\*\* pics would result in a reduction in supply, not an increase in demand.

As you would imagine, the comment section has [informative commentary](https://twitter.com/HeavenlyGrandpa/status/1406004213281329155).

However, there is one [comment](https://twitter.com/KevinL84/status/1406012226167885826) from KevinL84 that really catches my eye:

>OK but what if it's not like, the whole d\*\*\* at once? It's just a bit of it, that is left unread in the DM and it accrues interest and you just add a bit more if it over time? Like a d\*\*\* mutual fund?

Hmm, I am kind of lost for words. A d\*\*\* mutual fund would require a portfolio of many d\*\*\* pics or DM imboxes (or both?), so I guess that would work.  My main concern would be determining a firms incentive to pay interest on unread d\*\*\* pics in the DMs. Anyone who is an expert in this area is welcome to chime in.

**Theoretical Consideration**

The biggest problem with MILFWEEED's tweet is that she mischaracterizes the market of d\*\*\* pics. Hence, I constructed a model that better represents the way in which the **market value** of d\*\*\* pics is determined. For the sake of simplicity, I only created the model for heterosexual interactions. However, a similar model can be constructed for homosexual interactions.

Let M={m^(1),m^(2),...} and W={w^(1),w^(2),...} denote the set of all men and women, respectively. Furthermore, assume that the characteristics of individual t can be captured by the vector **c^(t)**.

Then, for each pair (m^(i),w^(j)), there exists

market supply: s^(i)(q|**c^(i)**,**c^(j)**,w^(j))

and

market demand: d^(j)(q|**c^(j)**,**c^(i)**,m^(i))

That is, there is an individual market for d\*\*\* pics for each possible combination of man (supplier) and woman (demander). The market supply, s^(i)(q|**c^(i)**,**c^(j)**,w^(j)), is determined to the man's ability to send the woman d\*\*\* pics, his relationship to her, and the production of the image. Perhaps, it is the case that the man does not have her phone number, so sending her d\*\*\* pics would be quite costly. Moreover, the social cost of sending d\*\*\* pics depends greatly depends on the man's relationship to the woman, her age, and his own characteristics, including his occupation (e.g. politician) and his endowment, so to speak. The woman's demand for d\*\*\* pics depends on the characteristics of the man, her relationship to the man, and her own characteristics. Clearly marital status of both agents status would affect the supply and demand of the market. Perhaps, a parameter can be added that factors in all of the d\*\*\* pics sent.

This model greatly from that of perfect competition, as the interpersonal relationship between the two individuals is far greater at influencing equilibrium allocations than the total number of d\*\*\* pics sent in the market. This model is also more accurate, as it allows for product differentiation and the ability of sellers to discriminate against discriminate buyers.

So, I decided to track down the real study, and looking at the links led me to this:

[Still a Man's Labor Market: The Slowly Narrowing Gender Wage Gap](https://iwpr.org/publications/still-mans-labor-market/)

Accordingly, ""[t]he commonly used figure to describe the gender wage ratio—that a woman earns 80 cents for every dollar earned by a man—understates the pay inequality problem by leaving many women workers out of the picture."" This sounds interesting, but what matters is methodology. So, let's take a look at that.

""When measured by total earnings across the most recent 15 years for all workers who worked in at least one year, women workers’ earnings were 49 percent—less than half—of men’s earnings, a wage gap of 51 percent in 2015. Progress has slowed in the last 15 years relative to the preceding 30 years in the study.""

And here we have the crux of the issue. We're looking at total earnings. I'm not attacking the study, but people who misinterpret the meaning of this. Let's make a highly simplified example (thanks to /u/besttrousers).

Say there are two people, M and F. M is male. F is female. Assume they went to the same school, have the same qualifications, graduated the same year, face the same market, the ceteris paribus works. 

M earns 1 dollar his first year, 2 his second, 3, 4, then 5.

F earns 1 her first year, 2, 3, but drops out of the labor force in year 4 because of family leave, before returning in year 5, in which she earns 4.

How do we look at the gender wage gap here? Let's start with average wage per year worked. On average, M earned 15/5 = 3 dollars on average. F earned 10/4 = 2.5 dollars on average. This is a wage gap of ~17%.

However, let's look at the GWG differently. Let's take total earnings across each year and divide by total years in the sample. Now, while M still earns 3 dollars on average, F earns 10/5 = 2 dollars on average, a wage gap of ~33%.

This new study (which builds upon a former study) takes the latter approach: ""This commonly used annual figure, however, understates the problem, especially for women workers, since it leaves so many of them out of the picture. The authors’ 2004 report, which pioneered the analysis of the earnings gap over 15-year periods, found an earnings gap of 62 percent for all women compared with all men (of prime working age) in the period studied, meaning that women made just 38 percent of what men made (Rose and Hartmann 2004).""

Now obviously, things are more complicated in the study, and the IWPR link will let you see the full report for yourself. I'm not attacking the study's veracity or methodology - that's for real, trained economists. 

My problem is with the sensationalized, clickbaity headlines that have come out from this study (Marketwatch, CBS, Vox, Yahoo, etc.) that imply that this counters the old 23% GWG figure. In reality, while it's possible some different data was used, leading to slightly different figures, the main takeaway is that a different methodology was used, leading to this gigantic difference.

[The /r/TheRedPill thread in question](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3v0q2h/the_role_of_assumptions_in_the_the_red_pill/)

&nbsp;

**R1:**

&nbsp;

*She is a woman, therefore may be woo’d. / She is a woman, therefore may be won.* (*Titus Andronicus*, Act II, Scene I, 82-83)

&nbsp;

People seem to have liked my first thread on bad economics in the RedPill community, so I’ve decided to make a second thread. Now I'm just an undergrad, so I apologize in advance if some of the economics in this post ends up being wrong. In this thread, we’re going to look at a post on /r/TheRedPill titled “The Role of Assumptions in the Red Pill Economy: Models for Intrinsic Valuation of the Wall.” This title might lead you to believe that the author will be discussing Game of Thrones, but unfortunately, this is not the case. For those lucky enough to have never encountered RedPill ideology in the wild, “the wall” refers to an age at which women’s “value” begins to decline. I have no idea how “value” is even defined, so I’ll assume it just refers to physical attractiveness and personality (subservience), both of which tend to decline as a woman gets older. I'd love to analyze the author's use of the word ""value"" in more detail, but I'll leave that to someone who's actually studied philosophy. Later on, we’ll also talk about “sexual market value,” (SMV), which is basically the price of a woman’s… services as if casual sex were a commodity which women supplied and men demanded. 

&nbsp;

Now that the jargon’s out of the way, let’s take a look at the actual post. Are you ready? Well, you better be, because the Bad Economics^TM starts just one word in:  

> **Abstract**

I was perplexed when I first read this heading because it didn’t make any sense. But moments later it dawned on me: this dude is structuring his post as if it were an academic paper, which may be the most pretentious thing I’ve ever seen on reddit. I didn’t include the text of the abstract here because it’s completely incoherent, but if you want to read it, be my guest.

&nbsp;

The introduction is just barely readable. The author writes:

> The Wall is the age at which the returns to scale or the marginal product of a females SMV starts to decrease.

I actually laughed when I first read this. While I still don’t really know what the author meant even after rereading this sentence multiple times, we don’t even need to know what he meant to realize that this is bad economics. First, the author uses the term “returns to scale” in a completely inappropriate context. “Returns to scale” refers to the effect of increasing inputs on the amount of output produced. The author then talks about “the marginal product of a female’s SMV.” This makes no sense. “Marginal product” refers to the additional output produced by adding one unit of some input. How can a woman’s sexual market value have a marginal product if sexual market value is analogous to a market price rather than to an input? Furthermore, I have no idea how “returns to scale” is synonymous with “the marginal product of a female’s SMV,” or why these things supposedly decrease after a certain age. Since this is /r/TheRedPill, maybe the author is an *ephebophile.*

&nbsp;

 The author then explains what he’s going to do in this “paper” 

> With examples, a framework for an Intrinsic Valuation of the wall will be given

According to Investopedia, “Intrinsic valuation” is a term that refers to the “true” value of a company or asset, as opposed to its price on the market. How does ""the wall"" have intrinsic value? I don’t know. I think what the author means to say is that he’s going to provide a framework for determining at what age the wall occurs, but since he's attempting to copy academic writing, he had to make his prose as opaque as possible. 

&nbsp;

The author then goes on to talk about “assumptions in the red pill economy,” and the age-old question of whether or not it’s important for economic models to be based on realistic assumptions.  I don’t really have much to criticize about this section, but I’ll include it anyway, because it’s hilarious how the author tries to imitate the style and formatting of real academic literature.  

> Whilst economist Milton Friedman(1953) pointed out the necessity for 'significant theories' to be proven by ‘unrealistic assumptions’, Alan Musgrave (1981) pointed the necessity to class assumptions (domain, negligibility, heuristic - see reading list) to achieve accuracy in testing economic models.

As far as I know, Friedman's point was that the thing that matters most about a model is not the realism of its assumptions, but how closely its results match reality. So according to Friedman, it's okay for a model to have some unrealistic assumptions. I haven't read Musgrave's work, so I don't really know what the author means by ""[classing] assumptions or why this is necessary ""to achieve accuracy in testing economic models.""

&nbsp;

Next, the author begins building his “model.” 

> To arrive at the age 30, several variables subject to their influence in your location are included in the valuation.
The valuation for the market that I operate in takes into account these variables that form assumptions for my Red Pill economy.

So apparently a woman reaches “the wall” when she turns 30 years old. I have no idea how the author arrives at this age. Even though the whole point of this model is to calculate the age at which women hit the wall, there’s no math to be found in the entire post. The author then goes on to list the variables which determine the location of the wall. 

> i) Physical Appeal - aesthetics and fitness.
ii) Market Mean age of marrying. - at what age are participants expected to be married if at all.
iii) Career emphasis. - Is a career emphasized?
iv) Viability of living an independent life. - nightlife etc
v) Education involvement. - Do participants enroll in higher/tertiary education.
vi) Traditional influence on lifestyle and outlook on life. religion etc

Umm, okay, I suppose? The author’s explanations of each variable are so sparse that we’ll just have to guess how they affect the location of the wall. 

> An Intrinsic market value may be derived from these variables.

What a cop out. This is on the same level as “the proof is left as an exercise for the reader.” I guess the author wanted to imitate the bad parts of academic writing as well as the good. Unfortunately, he only succeeded at one of those things.

&nbsp;

Next, the author discusses the implications of his “model,” which he seems to have just pulled out of his ass. 

> The intrinsic valuation for the wall given my constraints and assumptions is 26. At this age diminishing returns to scale take place.

What constraints? Is this supposed to be some kind of optimization problem? Who's maximizing or minimizing what, exactly? And again, the author misuses the term “returns to scale.”  

> Though girls physically are still appealing at 26, the demand significantly decreases due to upward pressure from girls aged 20-23 vying for the attention of suitable suitors aged, 27-33. The upward pressure is a result of low education involvement due to tradition, an environment that’s not conducive for an independent life, low nightlife appeal, environment where women are not career driven thus lowering the age at which to find a suitable long term partner.

I was left with so many questions after reading this paragraph. How does this “upward pressure” work? How does “low education involvement” push the wall up, and how is this a result of things like tradition, nightlife, and career ambitions? This is why math is useful in economics; had the author tried to formally model what he's saying here, he would have been forced to confront the fact that what he's saying makes no sense, and I would have been able to figure out what point he's trying to make.

&nbsp;

Next, the author talks about “market dynamics.” Keep in mind that he hasn’t specified at all who the actors are in this market or what the price signifies. 

>1. Marriage is still viable in my economy due to unchanged traditional perceptions.
2.	Women aged 26 onwards without a solid partner in life are treated with considerable caution especially in the absence of tertiary educational involvement.
3.	Unaware men (Beta) are often caught by this age group. 27 is the most common age for ‘mistaken pregnancy’. Coincidence or market mechanics (the wall)? You decide.
4.	Men who choose to be naive and don’t take the time and competency to study their market, end up divorced (Division of Assets) by age 36-38.

Okay, so apparently marriage is still practiced in part because of historical inertia, and people are wary of older women who are single. But why are “unaware men (beta)” so often caught by this age group? 

> Coincidence or market mechanics (the wall)? You decide.

i.e. “I have no evidence with which to back up my assertions, so I’ll frame it as a question to avoid having to make an actual argument.”

&nbsp;

Now we get to the last section, called “Hypothetical Implications: Like Banks, they get Bailed Out.” After rambling for a solid two paragraphs, the author compares a man paying alimony to his former spouse to a government bailing out a bank:

> The implications stay with the man as he will continually pay for his incompetency (alimony). In a nutshell, Incompetent men create winners out of potential losers - Bailout packages.

How on earth is alimony at all similar to a bailout package? The bank bailouts during the 2008 Financial Crisis were to prevent certain important financial institutions from failing and destabilizing the economy. In the bailouts, the federal government bought toxic assets from these financial institutions in order to keep them solvent. I think what the author's trying to say is that alimony rewards a woman for behaving badly, similar to how a bank bailout can be construed as rewarding a bank's bad behavior, and incentivizing further bad behavior. I also love how the author just takes it for granted that the woman is totally at fault for the divorce. Blaming other people for everything is Alpha, I guess.

&nbsp;

Finally, we get to the conclusion, in which the author goes completely overboard with cryptic, irrelevant aphorisms such as 

> Absolute freedom without responsibility is an illusion. Freedom to some degree can be attained by those who are competent and alert. To expect freedom by default, is a disastrous (heuristic) assumption on its own.

What does all this even mean? Your guess is as good as mine. It seems the author was more concerned with making his post sound like some grand 18th century political treatise than with actually making sense, a problem common to alt-right diatribes.

&nbsp;

So there you have it: another example of terrible economics from /r/TheRedPill. In the end, this is a perfect example of what Richard Feynman dubbed [""Cargo cult science,""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science) which refers to practices which assume all the trappings of real science while containing none of the rigor that makes scientific inquiry such a powerful tool. Instead of creating ideology which fits models, the author creates models to fit his ideology, and is therefore blind to the flaws in that ideology. In the immortal words of William Shakespeare:

&nbsp;

*""There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, / Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.""* (*Hamlet*, Act I, Scene V, 165-167).

Fruit so low it is rotting on the floor. Not necessarily because the idea itself is bad (microfinance works sometimes, and sometimes it doesn't) but because the presentation and content is utter garbage.

I'm not sure if this reflects poorly on the World Economic Forum or Bain and Co/Google, but nonetheless.

R1:
This article is almost incomprehensible in the way information was put together. It was very difficult to follow or read, which was frustrating because there was so little actual content.

>Encouraging female entrepreneurship could employ 170 million people by 2030. Other benefits include social outcomes and gender-sensitive innovations. Currently just 17% of female-owned enterprises employ hired staff.

First of all, a bold claim, followed by meaningless jargon and generalization: ""gender-sensitive innovations""? ""Social outcomes""? Followed then by a statistic that has nothing really to do with the earlier two sentences except by connotation to an unsupported and possibly incorrect conclusion (even when based solely on the evidence presented).

Then, without any evidence, the claim that encouraging entrepreneurship will increase employment is mentioned twice more with no supporting evidence other than a graph showing the ""potential impact"" of an ""increase in women-owned  enterprises"", i.e., a graph that says this is how many people these business _might_ employ.

They then move on to other advantages from ""increased  participation of women in entrepreneurship"" again with no references other than an assumedly equally terrible Bain and Co./Google Report. Then they get to what I can only assume is the supporting evidence section: 

>India has between 13 million and 16 million micro-, small- and medium-scale enterprises and agribusinesses owned by women, the Bain & Company-Google report stated.

>Notably, most of these women-owned ventures are single-person businesses, which translates to lower returns and employment. Only 17% of all woman-owned enterprises employ hired workers in comparison with 28% for all enterprises, the report said.

>Rural, non-farm, home-based businesses form the largest share (38%) of woman-led ventures in India. Urban, self-employed women who work from home constitute 31% of woman entrepreneurs, as per the report.

>“Farm-based business owners at 18% and small business owners at 14% employing less than 10 employees contribute most to employment generation,” the report said.

If you're struggling to understand what half of these numbers are doing here, you're not alone. But that aside likely what is being suggested here is that female entrepreneurs don't employ many people, and if they were to grow and hire people, then they would since other businesses that are larger _also employ workers_(more holy Grail causality). Incredible. To out more sensible words in their mouth, this is essentially a piece pushing microfinance and the idea that this is the way forward in India. This is despite the now old evidence that microfinance is most definitely not a one-size-fits all solution. (Just see Banerjee 2014, a seminal paper from 6 years ago, or any of the excellent papers by Woodruff). Anyone who has spent time with basic development economics knows to touch microfinance with a ten foot pole and a mini swimming pool of caveats. Yes it works in Bangladesh, but that doesn't mean it will everywhere else and for everyone. Often, these small businesses aren't businesses that can or even want to grow. They sometimes exist only because the people who own them have no way of working in labour markets due to gender norms (obviously important in this context). To be fair microfinance sometimes is helpful, I'm not R1 ing microfinance. I'm R1ing the application of it to draw such lofty and misleading conclusions. Arguably, a good amount of money has been poorly placed in programs that will do very little for anyone other than the entrepreneurs themselves (which is good but not the point of the programs).

Even beyond that, the evidence presented actually works against the very argument stated. If female businesses tend to employ less people than other businesses (on average) then why on Earth do you think they are a good candidate to boost employment? _Why not the businesses that actually do employ more people_?

Even beyond _that_, the external validity of these conclusions are ridiculous and it doesn't take much to start seeing holes. Clearly if these businesses grow, then they will compete and some will drop out. You can't simultaneously have every small business owner grow and employ more people without more competition taking place, and some firms being forced to exit. Sure if you also have a massive boost to demand then maybe, but there's no evidence to expect that.

To claim to be a font of Economic wisdom and produce such content warrants explanation.

Some background on WEF (scroll up for actual article and R1). This is hardly the only article guilty of this.
I followed this group on Facebook since I was trying to put more ""econ news"" in my feed. Turns out little of what they put out at least on FB is news, and very little has anything to do with Economics. I hear they also host Davos, but honestly I'm not quite sure what they actually do.

Here can you read about lady Gaga concerts and Bill Gates's philanthropy alongside Joseph Stiglitz's take on Coronavirus.

Based on the content they put out, it feels like what a 1st year undergrad econ student thinks Economics is: Something that can help you predict the future, a guide to improving your personal finances and something that tells people how they should behave. As most people learn Economics is none of those things (most of the time).

Usually they put out some semi-egregious content like Business Insider type content, or some shocking commentary: 'this just in, coronavirus will put at-risk people more at-risk'. But now with things going a bit crazier they have shoved out insane amounts of content, sometimes posting two articles every half hour. Most pseudo-scientific r/upliftingnews clickbait type stuff, very occasionally content from actual economics experts. 99% of their posts are either empty clickbait or have nothing to do with economics (often reposted several times over the weeks).

The articles are often completely meaningless and devoid of any insight and therefore mistakes. Often after clicking on an article that sounds interesting you become confused as if there is a mistake, when you find that what you're reading has nothing to do with the headline. Just completely unactionable and meaningless content. But there are some slip-ups. A few gems like this pop up though, showing that there isn't too much thought out into what they post when they do talk about economics.

The thing that drives me nuts is that this group, whatever it is, pretends to ""represent"" Economics and some people are fooled by this. They can't even reference properly most of the time.",gyg7,t2_50jk3l,0.84,52,27

Edit: [tl;dr](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/83ll72/raskhistorians_and_the_masculine_provider_fantasy/dvirs0d/) via /u/gorbachev

I normally love the content in /r/AskHistorians but this is an RI of the question being posed itself, the top /r/AskHistorians response, and also a bit of a broader RI on the *1950s American golden age* trope, “If we could only return to the 1950s, then we could …” 


It begins: **[Is it true that in the 50's the average man could provide for his family by himself? (In contrast to now, where both man and woman seem to need to work to provide for the family)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/83dbrg/is_it_true_that_in_the_50s_the_average_man_could/)**

The “back when the MAN could PROVIDE for the whole family by his-self with his BARE HANDS” (said loudly and with a drawl) arguments immediately misrepresent and trivialize women’s role in the home. Every (undeleted) comment in that thread misses this. I'm calling it the **Masculine Provider Fantasy** and think it contributes to a lot of badeconomics and unhealthy societal expectations (""men should provide for women as they are too frail and weak and stupid to have agency""). 

I just want to make this very clear: housewives in the 1950s *were not* lounging around relaxing all day being *provided for*; women were heavily involved in *domestic production* (the kind that is not measured in GDP because they’re not transactional activities).
 
Think of any photo of a poor African village - the women carrying large containers in their hands and on their head 5km each way for fresh water are engaged in labor-intensive domestic production all day long; are they *being provided for*? (Bonus question: if given the choice would any of those poor village women prefer to be an accountant in an air-conditioned office? Would she then contribute some of her new salary to buying a better home for her children? Congratulations – that’s what happened in the US!) The development of capital for the household like the washing machine, refrigeration, pre-prepared foods and other household appliances allowed women the extra time to leave the home to work outside of it rather than being cloistered to the kitchen. 

In other words before the 1950s in the US it was *necessary* to have one person constantly engaged in domestic production – those people were generally women. (I've heard someone phrase it like this: all technology died tomorrow, you or your significant other would probably have to quit in order to do those domestic tasks: haul water, wash clothes by hand, pluck chickens, prepare food, etc. Who would quit? Probably whoever made the lower salary yeah? Did men or women make higher salaries in the 1950s?) 

**Women were always providing for the family**, but because it was domestic production it was not counted by official statistics (“if you marry your maid, GDP falls”) and those women didn’t get a paycheck. Changes in domestic technology allowed women to pursue paid work opportunities outside of the home - providing income for the family instead of services.

>**Employment Changes**

> In other words, in the 1950s it is fair to say there was a lot more labor participation for men than there is today— 

Yes 

>only 2 in 100 men that were seeking employment would not have found it, compared to 12 in 100 today. 

No

This isn’t what labor force participation means! OP is defining unemployment! The labor force participation rate is calculated as the labor force divided by the total working-age population. OP tries to correct this in a follow-up: 

>>> Yes, it is different from the unemployment rate. However, both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate only includes those who are actively seeking work, because the definition of the ""labor force"" is only people who are actively seeking work.

But Op thinks labor force is the denominator of LFPR (as in unemployment) rather than the numerator. Whoops! 
The [source cited](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160620_cea_primeage_male_lfp.pdf) even gives us the correct version on page 6, which OP misses:

>> The share of men between the ages of 25 and 54 either working or actively seeking work, also known as the prime-age male labor force participation rate, has been falling for more than 60 years and today stands at 88 percent.

OP claims 12% of men 25-54 seeking work today can’t find work - that is wrong 12% of men 25-54 are not working or seeking work. This report further gives: 

>> As shown in Figure 12, the share of nonparticipating prime-age men reporting they want a job has fallen over time, from a peak of 28 percent in 1985 to 16 percent in 2015. This suggests that at least a portion of the *increase in nonparticipation stems from men deciding that they do not want to work*, at least in the jobs available to them. 

OP's premise is conflating labor force participation and unemployment. 

> This leads us to the first and most compelling point about why single-family incomes in America seemed to work so well: for basically any prime age male in America, in 1950, if you wanted work you could find it.

>>[ **Recap**] Primarily in the form of near-guaranteed-employment

Unemployment in the 1950s ranged from 3%-8%; [unemployment today stands at the same rate it did in 1950](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE ). I don't see a sizeable difference from today other than men now choosing to work less or SBTC, but those who want to work seem to be able to find work.  

And for any prime age woman in the 1950s, well tough shit – those clothes aren’t going to wash themselves! 


>**Purchasing Power Changes**

> saw each year giving them more income, greater buying power, and a rising standard of living. By comparison, real median wage has stagnated in purchasing power from 1980–2010. (Current Population Report, Census) A natural side effect of this, along with household consumption continuing to rise, led to greater pressure on households to diversify into two-income.

It’s a good thing people are paid *compensation* which is wages *and benefits*. [Real Compensation per hour](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/COMPRNFB) has been rising. 

[Real Median family income](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEFAINUSA672N) has been rising  

[Real Median household income](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N) has been rising 

For support the author links to [these slides]( https://web.stanford.edu/class/polisci120a/immigration/Median%20Household%20Income.pdf) which cut off the last 25 years of data for some unexplained reason. (Also plotting the nominal and real on the same chart is bad form as it compresses the real data.) Despite this data being easily accessible, why the author doesn’t use data more current than 1990 is a mystery. Looking at [recent data]( https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEFAINUSA672N) we can note relative to 1953 real median family income in 2016 is more than double. 

Also I'll make an obligatory reference to [Where Has All the Income Gone](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/where-has-all-the-income-gone) 

>“[…] the findings in this article are consistent with recent research showing that the largest income increases occurred at the top end of the income distribution. However, **the findings here are not consistent with the view that the incomes of middle American households stagnated over the past 30 years. Income for most middle American households increased substantially.**”

So I don't buy OP's claim that dual earners families are from stagnant wages in the 1980s, as compensation is clearly increasing over that whole time period. Onto the next one: 

>**Women Entering the Workforce**

> Of difficult-to-quantify effects, we also have women entering the workforce over this time period, which in theory would increase total employable pools and put downward pressure on wages for labor.

Zero-sum lump of labor thinking; those women no longer have to beg their husbands to buy goods and services for them, those women are now directly buying things they want themselves with their own money. Again, if you have some village woman who no longer needs to spend 4 hours a day trekking for water because her home now has plumbing, and she spends those 4 hours working for an income – there’s both more production (S) and more spending (D). When the supply of labor exogenously increases, labor demand increases also so more women working will have an ambiguous effect on wages. Similarly, as we've already seen the total compensation throughout this period was rising! (Interesting thought: do women and men have different compensation preferences? Do women prefer a larger percentage of compensation to be paid as benefits?)  

>**Sentimental and Inaccurate Media Depictions of Post-War America**

I actually like this section. Thankfully OP explores that minorities might have better lives today than you know before the Civil Rights Act. 

>This put greater pressure on wives to have earning power in poorer households.

I wonder as women entered the workforce, to what extent were the new entrants in professional occupations from wealthier or higher income families. Into professional occupations I'd expect middle class backgrounds (the family owns the requisite capital to lower domestic production). This would be hard to test since opportunities for a professional occupation and household amenities are endogenous to family income. 

>**Recap**

>To summarize: although it may be an exaggeration to say ""the average 1950s man could provide for his family by himself""

I'd rather just say it's wrong. 

>Primarily in the form of near-guaranteed-employment, and higher and continual growth in buying power for labor, **median single-family households probably ""felt"" better off in 1950 and 1960 than they do today.** 

Maybe some white men 'felt' better off, but I highly doubt it would even be a majority of them. 

We've shown above that compensation and incomes are higher, obviously opportunity is higher, technological progress in consumer goods kind of speaks for itself, but let's look at some other realities of 1950 that aren't directly comparable^1 today (via U.S. Census Bureau's *Current Housing Reports Series* and *Census of Population and Housing*): 

* size of houses in the 1950s compared to the average house size today in square footage, number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms

* fall of the household size from ~3.5 to ~2.5

* rise of single occupant and single parent households (these change the composition of the 'average' household)

* the availability of complete indoor plumbing; in 1940 approximately half of US homes lacked hot piped water, bathing facilities, or toilet

* coal heating (50% of homes in 1940), wood heating (25% of homes in 1940), coke heating , fuel oil heating have all moved almost entirely to electrical/natural gas^2 today (next time you're in a developing country, watch for people cooking food with coal/coke stoves on the side of the road, then imagine that in your living room)

* air conditioning changing the habitability of the south and west

* life expectancy, infant mortality, educational opportunity and attainment, blah blah blah
 

---------------------------------------------------------------

Anyway what did happen in the 1950s? 

I follow [Robert Gordon's take:](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071W7JCKW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) from 1920-1970 the interstate highways, mass air travel, electronics and plastics, air conditioning, household appliances replacing housework, vaccination and antibiotics, birth control, university education, etc. were transformative technologies and we can see this in the high productivity of the time, growing 2.8% per year. Productivity increases opportunities, wages, etc. Since the 1970s technology advance has been arguably more marginal in nature: microwaves, cable tv, cell phones, etc., accordingly productivity growth has only been about 1.6% per year since then. 

Summarizing: productivity gave us domestic capital, this allowed women to move into the labor force and this was an unambiguously good thing; we shouldn't herald back to ""one man supporting a family"" as some golden age where the wages were high and the women worked at home for free.

729,hfrbhv,2020-06-25,badeconomics,Problems with problems with problems with causal estimates of the effects of race in the US police system,"Racial discrimination, given it's immense relevance in today's political discourse as well as it's longstanding role in the United States’ history, has been the subject of an immense amount of research in economics.

Questions like ""what is the causal effect of race on the probability of receiving a loan?"" and, with renewed fervor in recent years questions like ""what is the effect of race on things like police use of force, probability of being arrested, and conditional on being arrested, what's the probability of being prosecuted?"". This R1 is about [https://5harad.com/papers/post-treatment-bias.pdf](https://5harad.com/papers/post-treatment-bias.pdf) (Goel et al from now on), which is itself a rebuttal to [https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/jmummolo/files/klm.pdf](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/jmummolo/files/klm.pdf), (Mummolo et al) which is itself a rebuttal to papers like [https://scholar.harvard.edu/fryer/publications/empirical-analysis-racial-differences-police-use-force](https://scholar.harvard.edu/fryer/publications/empirical-analysis-racial-differences-police-use-force) (Freyer) which try to estimate the role of race in police use of force. 

Mummolo et al is making the argument that common causal estimates of the effect of race on police-related outcomes are biased. Fivethirtyeight does a good job outlining the case here [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-statistics-dont-capture-the-full-extent-of-the-systemic-bias-in-policing/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-statistics-dont-capture-the-full-extent-of-the-systemic-bias-in-policing/) but the basic idea is that if you believe that police are more likely to arrest minorities then your set of arrest records is a biased sample and will produce biased estimates of the effect of race on police-related outcomes.

The paper I am R1ing is about the question ""conditional on being arrested, what is the effect of race on the probability of being prosecuted?"" Goel et al use a set of covariates, including data from the police report and the arrestee’s race to try and get a causal estimate of the effect of race on the decision to prosecute. They claim that the problems outlined by Mummolo et al do not apply. They cite that in their sample, conditional on the details in the police report, White people who are arrested are prosecuted 51% of the time, while Black people are prosecuted 50% of the time. They use this to argue that there is a limited effect of race on prosecutorial decisions, conditional on the police report. The authors describe the experiment they are trying to approximate with their data as:

>""...one might imagine a hypothetical experiment in which explicit mentions of race in the incident report are altered (e.g., replacing “white” with “Black”). The causal effect is then, by definition, the difference in charging rates between those cases in which arrested individuals were randomly described (and hence may be perceived) as “Black” and those in which they were randomly described as “white.”

I'll explain soon why this experiment is not at all close to what they are measuring. Goel et al go on to argue why the ""conditional on the police report"" is sufficient to extract a causal estimate. They argue

>""In our recurring example, subset ignorability means that among arrested individuals, after conditioning on available covariates, race (as perceived by the prosecutor) is independent of the potential outcomes for the charging decision. Subset ignorability is thus just a restatement of the traditional ignorability assumption in causal inference, but where we have explicitly referenced the first-stage outcomes to accommodate a staged model of decision making. Indeed, almost all causal analyses implicitly rely on a version of subset ignorability, since researchers rarely make inferences about their full sample; for instance, it is standard in propensity score matching to subset to the common support of the treated and untreated units’ propensity scores.""

They then go on to create synthetic data where

>""First, prosecutorial records do not contain all information that influenced officers’ first-stage arrest decisions (i.e., prosecutors do not observe Ai).  
>  
>Second, our set-up allows for situations where the arrest decisions are themselves discriminatory—those where αblack > 0...  
>  
>Third, the prosecutor’s records include the full set of information on which charging decisions are based  
>  
>(i.e., Zi and Xi). Moreover, the charging potential outcomes (generated in Step 3) depend only on one’s criminal history, Xi, not on one’s realized race, Zi, and, consequently, Y (z, 1) ⊥ Z | X, M = 1. Thus by construction, our generative process satisfies subset ignorability.""

Naturally, their synthetic data support their conclusions. They run propensity score matching and recover similar estimates to their old papers.

There are two problems I have with their analysis is that the information available to the prosecutor is itself a possible product of bias. One is a more normative critique, implicitly, what Goel et al are saying is that while race may play a role in who is being arrested, it does not play a role in what is entered in the police report. I have a hard time believing this. If you accept, as Goel et al do, that race plays a factor in who gets arrested then it stands to reason that it also affects what is recorded in the police report. Beyond “objective facts” being misreported or lied about, there are also issues of subjectivity. If officers are more suspicious of minorities, and therefore arrest them at higher rates (as Geol et al allow for), then it is likely that they are also more suspicious when writing the police report. This is a normative critique, but it seems relevant. 

Edit: The more math-y critique is that they ignore the possibility of something affecting both the decision to arrest and the decision to prosecute. In effect, they ignore the possibility of conditioning on a confounder. Here I'm imagining something like a politician pressuring the district attorney and the officers to be tougher on crime. It affects both the decision to prosecute and the decision to arrest.  Maybe an officer doesn't write something on the police report, but tells the attorney. The authors might think this is a bad example and maybe they can convince me, but I take issue with them not acknowledging the possibility. 

Tldr; If you assume away all your problems then you no longer have any problems!

Classic [broken window fallacy](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/broken-window-fallacy.asp). The purpose of the military isn't to create jobs. It's for national defense, or conquest. If jobs were the end goal, you don't even need a military. Just pay people to stay at home and do nothing. That would actually be a more productive use of taxpayer dollars, because it would be much less expensive per ""job"" created, and it would free up an enormous amount of scarce resources to be used in other areas within the economy. 

Sure, the military creates a bunch of jobs. But in doing so, it removes that human capital from the labor market. This drives up the price of labor for entrepreneurs and business owners, which drives up prices for consumers. This also applies to other materials - oil, metals, R&D. Using those resources on military squanders them away from other more productive uses. The budget increase is going to be financed through federal deficit spending. That reduces consumer purchasing power. Every job that is created by the federal government is literally paid for by reducing the quality of life for every other US citizen.

Again, I'm not saying military has no value at all. But more ""JOBS, JOBS, JOBS"" is not a good thing. This is a president who ran on the campaign of ""draining the swamp"". Now he's cheer-leading more swamp. Wtf?

Edit 1:

Just gonna add some clarification since a lot of people are getting caught up here. 

My argument is that taking able-bodied labor out of the free market and squandering it on military is not a positive for the economy, it's a negative. The positive is what you get by doing that: national defense - and that's what the POTUS should be cheering about.

It's like when you buy food from the store. The lost money you had to spend on food hurts you. The food itself helps you. No one cheers about how much money they spent on groceries. You might cheer if you got the groceries at a discount.

There is an enormous amount of literature on this topic. [Here is my favorite resource that everyone should take the time to read](https://www.ibiblio.org/ml/libri/s/SmithA_WealthNations_p.pdf) - it's also available as a [free audio book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp-59DOIi88). And I'm happy to discuss more in the comments. I'm pretty happy with the active discussion and healthy debate!

Edit 2: 

I recently wrote a more in-depth explanation with more details that also addresses some of the other concerns that people have raised on this thread over the military's benefit to the economy (which is not the focus of this post).

https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/7wlzjy/donald_trump_getting_excited_because_increasing/duqi3r8/

Here's a snippet:

> Trump is bragging about creating jobs because he believes people are struggling to find work and he knows that employment rates are one of the ways that people measure the success of the economy. The fallacy here is that the jobs themselves aren't an intrinsic plus for the economy - they're an intrinsic cost. He's basically cheering about how much money he's spending (with the implication that he's fixing the economy) without measuring the actual benefit to the economy.

> Even if you wanted to look at the MB>MC effect of hiring additional military personnel, that does not imply the creation of more value for society as a whole - only for the military. Even if the military industrial complex has some short-term benefits to the economy, this completely ignores future hidden costs (like veteran benefits, instability created in conquered nations leading to terrorism, etc), and conveniently, economists who are pro-military never seem to look at society as a whole (including the foreign countries that are being invaded). Again, the long-term effects of blowing up other countries may include fewer options, higher prices, and less liberty for citizens and consumers. This isn't even the point of my post, but it's worth while to point out how shallow some of the comments in this thread are that are arguing that the military provides a net economic benefit. Like look at Germany's and Japan's almost non-existent military after WW2, yet they ate the USA's lunch for economic growth during the decades to follow.",jsideris,t2_10fvfg,0.87,154,183

This assumes a fair society. In reality, in the current capitalist model it would be more like:
Less jobs, maintain daily hours on existing jobs, blame those unemployed for being jobless, remove benefits, cull population by starvation.
https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/6jbq6e/glastonbury_food_vendors_uproar_after_jeremy/
There are several problems with this comment so let's break it down into smaller chunks for easier debunking.

1. Finance jobs are worthless
2. Redistribution of wealth will lead to shorter working hours on average
3. That in our current ""capitalist model"" there will be massive starvation of the unemployed.

Let's start with the claim that finance jobs are worthless, the first problem with that statement is that there is no objective way to determine a value which is needed for the statement worthless. The best attempt we have to create a system of value measurement the price system places a high value on finance jobs given that they pay high salaries
Studies have shown that the average financial worker contributes more to the economy in the UK than the average worker
http://www.cityam.com/263446/financial-and-professional-services-industry-contributes

To think about how finance workers contribute to the economy you must consider capital a scarce resource which has to be allocated in the most efficient manner. Finance allows it to be allocated in the most efficient manner by creating various option for its allocation via different type of financial instruments, HTF trading allows new information to be quickly factored into markets increasing the efficiency of the price market that forms the bed-rock of our current economy. Without them our ability to allocate capital towards certian goals,products and services would be severly hampered and it would most likley retard our economic growth signficatly

The next claim is that redistributing wealth will lead to shorter working hours for the average person, this isn't necessarily true as creating the administrative infrastructure to administer these benefits will obviously consume personnel and if done inefficiently could raise a number of hours worked. Behaviour economics is also a tricky subject even at the best of times as it combines the economic and physiology two notoriously soft sciences, It's quite possible that work-time could stay the same as people seek a higher standard of living

The third claim can be disproved by history as technology has rarely ever led to calls of the population because technology doesn't just destroy jobs. It also creates jobs such as how the number of jobs for bank workers increased at the same time as the ATM was introduced as it allowed far more bank branches to be opened

734,5ee29v,2016-11-23,badeconomics,Obamacare is a heat seeking missile that will destroy jobs: A Primer on Job Lock and the Dangers of Reasoning from a Quantity Change,"**Overview**


In this R1 I will be going over an example of reasoning from a quantity change and how that is flawed. It is flawed for the exact same reasons that reasoning from a price change is, because the important part is what is driving the price change (or quantity change).  We shall see that just because the Affordable Care Act looks like it reduced the amount of labor supplied, that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, due to an existing distortion causing too much labor supplied in the labor market (more on this later).  Finally, I will note that this R1 will not claim attempt to quantify the reduction of job lock due to Obamacare, merely note that this possibility must be accounted for. Finally, I make no claims that negative aspects of Obamacare do not outweigh these positive job lock effects. Feel free to continue opposing Obamacare if you want to. Just be aware of this argument for it

Furthermore, if you believe in job-lock, you will support either the removal of subsidies for employer provided health insurance or allowing all types of health insurance to be subsidized. Some Republican proposals do these things!

**The Claim**


>The director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who said during congressional testimony  that the bill would kill 800,000 full-time jobs in the first decade alone. Bottom Line: As Minnesota Congressmen John Kline puts it, “ to suggest [Obamacare] doesn’t undermine job creation is to deny reality.


See the framing? It’s going reduced jobs = bad. However, this is reasoning from a quantity change! It assumes that more jobs = good. We need to ask what is driving these changes to know if the decrease in jobs is a good thing or not.

____

**Theoretical Background**


Health insurance is often tied to employment because of the very large subsidies given to employers to purchase health insurance. Premiums from employer provided health insurance are tax exempt, allowing employers and employees to prefer it as a form of compensation just to dodge taxes (this is not efficient at all). 
This basically means that if an employer spends $1 on health insurance, it translates into $1 of benefit received by workers. Monetary compensation does not work like this, as both employers and employees will have to pay taxes (particularly if the employee is high income and therefore in a high tax bracket). So for direct compensation, it might take $1.50 of spending to give the employee $1 of take home pay. This is very distortionary, as composition of compensation is being determined by *tax policy* not worker’s preferences or the firm’s fundamentals of providing those benefits.


There could be other reasons (internalizing externalities from healthcare for example) but even if these are present, making health insurance subsidized is unlikely to be a good idea. For example, in the internalizing externality case, we don't need any government intervention. But I am getting ahead of myself. To better understand job-lock and it’s implications, it’s often a good idea to look at a situation where we *don’t* have job-lock. In which case, it will just be a compensating differential. Firms that offer health insurance can pay lower wages then firms that do not.


[Gruber and Madrian (2002)]( http://www.nber.org/papers/w8817.pdf) offer an example. This paper is also a good literature summary.



>In this example, health insurance coverage consists of a binary, homogeneous good; individuals are either covered or not, and if covered have the exact same insurance plans. Insurance is perfectly experience rated at the worker level. That is, firms essentially purchase insurance on a worker-by-worker basis and are charged a separate premium for each worker. Jobs that offer health insurance feature a negative compensating wage differential. Moreover, each individual job (worker-firm match) can have its own compensation structure; firms can offer insurance to some workers and not others, and can pay lower wages to those workers whose insurance costs more.


So basically


1.	There is one kind of insurance (akin to a homogenous good assumption)


2.	Firms know the *exact* insurance costs of an individual worker. (a perfect information assumption)


Therefore, if you are a worker in this case, you can choose between having a firm compensate you for health insurance or just having a higher wage. So you can receive $100 worth of health benefits or $100 in extra wage income. Furthermore, a firm can offer you health insurance on a purely individual level.  
By free entry, we will have firms pay workers the specific costs of insuring them any less and firms are having economic losses, anymore and they have economic profit.


So basically it becomes irrelevant if you have health insurance or not. It doesn’t increase or decrease your total compensation. As such, **it cannot affect any labor supply decisions you make**.


Let’s relax the assumption that insurance is homogenous across all firms. Let’s say larger firms can offer insurance at cheaper rates. This could be due to increased pools of individuals, fixed administration costs, or bigger firms are able to take advantage of the subsidies for employer provided health insurance (this one is especially important).  


If you are more productive at a small firm, but a larger firm can offer you more compensation *solely because they can offer cheaper insurance* we are seeing health insurance distort labor supply decisions. If we had perfect competition, the only way to increase your compensation would be to move to where you are most productive.  This is an example of job lock. This lock will allow the firm to earn some rents from the worker. If the firm tries to capture all of these rents, the worker will become indifferent between the two jobs. 


Gruber and Madrian note the following about this possibility


>There is a long literature on the incidence of health insurance costs which speaks to this question, and it is reviewed by others at this conference, as well as in Gruber (2000). That literature finds clear evidence that the costs of insurance are shifted to worker wages on average, at least in the medium to long run. And there is also evidence in Gruber (1994) and Sheiner (1999) cost shifting to broad demographic groups within the workplace, with relatively high cost groups (such as older workers or women of child-bearing age) receiving lower wages as a result. But there is no evidence to date that speaks to worker-specific shifting. In practice, full rent capture on a worker-by-worker basis seems unlikely, due to preference revelation and administrative difficulties. So long as pay discrimination by valuation of insurance doesn't occur on a person-by-person basis, there will be job lock.


Once you accept that job lock works to change the *types* of jobs and firms (substitution on the intensive margin or inside the labor force) you work at, it’s pretty easy to think about it also affecting retirement decisions (extensive margin or entering/exiting the labor force). This makes the employer provided subsidy very problematic. The subsidy allows employers to be able to purchase health insurance cheaper then workers. As such, they may choose to continue working and, in effect, buy insurance through their employer.  This is tricky to estimate, as staying working longer for more compensation (including health insurance) *isn’t* distortionary.  


----

**Application to Policy**

Finally, Obamacare sought to increase the availability of cheap private insurance and reduce pre-existing conditions. These actions could reduce job lock in several ways. First of all, individuals with pre-existing conditions would be more able to move between jobs (previously they had around 90 days or could get labeled with a condition, making employment much more difficult). Also, allowing private alternatives to employer provided health insurance will limit job lock as well, as it gives an alternative where employees do not simultaneously make health insurance purchasing decisions and labor supply decisions. 


Finally I’ll note that job-lock likely isn’t eliminated by Obamacare and that lots of the evidence for job-lock is using reduced form work that assumes no real differences between workers (looking at workers who abruptly lost coverage vs. workers who didn’t). I don’t think these are always perfectly exogenous but I think suggest that job-lock is a relevant. If you have any smoking guns, please post it.

As usual, I have a video I made for my Economics YouTube channel, and can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44qzWa9uUZA)

\-------------

We have 2 big aspects to the video. We have more stuff getting produced and consumed. And then we have growth. And we have waste. This is important and the connection will become more apparent as this video goes on. The goal of this R1 will be to show that you can’t have our economic growth without all of the goods and services and ‘consumerism’ that goes along with that.

>In the global North, overconsumption runs rampant. Whether it’s a brand new Tesla Model S or a nice pair of jeans, buying for status, acceptance, desire, or because of that Instagram ad are all ingrained in our conception of success and mental wellbeing. Under Capitalism, we buy the right things as a way for us to seek acceptance from, and connection with, our peers. The barrage of ads we encounter everyday equate smiles with Kaki’s, suaveness with sunglasses and even love with headphones. But this drive to purchase that new Swiffer wet jet or new car is not an inherently biological trait.

Aaaand we’re off to the races. Waste, consumerism, consumption and capitalism. Naturally the way capitalism is framed here is as a modern invention, and supposedly advertising is making us buy all of this stuff. It’s all modern woes that didn’t exist in the past. The implication is that all of this is a modern construction, that has created a modern problem. It’s all to do with the seeming imperative for infinite growth on a finite world. Therefore, according to the video,  that’s why degrowth must happen to save the planet. And yet how true is that historically?

A lot of claims are made here and there is a lot to unpack.

From the Great Divergence: China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy. Page 130, After 1400 there is a large increase of people using goods to define themselves, even as popular works decried this trend. Basically what was becoming a middle class was trying to emulate the rich by buying things only available to the rich previously, and then the rich shifted their consumption to other items of status that were out of reach of the emerging middle class (for a lack of a better term), but as the Industrial Revolution took off and further lowered prices, this cycle continued. “Large numbers of writers complained that these trends drained the wealth of society, bankrupted noble families, and undermined more important measures of status and human worth. Throughout Europe, governments and religious institutions tried, at least intermittently, to arrest these tendencies-but with little success. Increasingly, people defined themselves though the tireless accumulation of possessions.”

The author notes that is was the demand for goods that helped spur the Industrial Revolution and rapid output of goods, rather than the increased supply creating an increase in demand.

From the Mind and the Market: Capitalism in Western Thought. Page 57, we get the following cycle (in reference to the 1760s and 70s) “What had once been regarded as ‘luxuries’ came to be seen as mere ‘necessities’, what had been ‘decencies’ become ‘necessities’ and the very definition of ‘necessities’ changed. Objects once reserved for the rich now come into the reach of a larger part of society. ‘Goods once produced laboriously at home, such as clothes, beer, candles, cutlery, and furniture, could now be purchased instead. This part is important, as we get, ‘What was new was not the desire to consume, it was the ability to consume that was unprecedented, made possible by the increase in national wealth and the declining cost of goods.” Page 58

From he Enlightened Economy: An Economic History of Britain 1700-1850 page 15, “The consumer revolution, as it has been called, clearly preceded the Industrial Revolution and had been attributed to a growth in household earnings stimulated by the new and desirable goods that were coming on-line the Seventeenth century and which prompted people to work more to generate the cash that made them accessible"". It’s easy to take consumerism now for granted, but it certainly wasn’t in the past. Between 1820s and 1850’s, even as the Industrial Revolution spread into more industries and effected the lives of more people, consumption actually didn’t increase that much and during this period men and women were shorter and were not consuming as many calories as they had previously. So there were advancements and increases in production and increases in consumption (especially of the rise of the ‘middling sort’, roughly a middle class) from 1700 to 1820, and then this slowed down quite dramatically before picking up again after the 1850s.

Naturally capitalism here is not defined and the definition is assumed. We can assume he’s basically referring to capitalism as most of the bad stuff happening in the world to do with waste, consumption and marketing. But what about our overreliance on non-renewables?

**It’s worth looking at a theoretical paper on the subject.**

Source 4. Page 4. Source finds that long run growth can be sustained even if substitution between input materials and natural resources is less than unity (1). This holds if substitution of different resources is greater in the knowledge-using sector than the knowledge competing sector.

The way I read this (and I’m happy to be proven wrong)  is that if an industry uses 100 tonnes of an input but then has to substitute for another input but requires 110 tonnes for the same output, that can still lead to sustained long-run growth if this occurs in the knowledge using sector. And this is all done under market conditions using prices rather than mandates.

From the conclusion: “However, we have shown that with poor input substitution, the knowledge spillovers can only sustain growth if substitution in the sector for which innovation is developed is larger than in the sector without innovation opportunities. In this case, the increasing scarcity-price of resources makes the sector without innovation opportunities relatively expensive, shifting consumer demand towards the innovating sector and increasing the incentives for innovation.”

&#x200B;

>”Green growth doesn’t work” \[hence degrowth is required\] In addition to its impact on individuals self-conception and mental health, capitalist overproduction and subsequent overconsumption, especially in the global North, drives massive waste, emissions and pollution.

There is a ginormous, massive, irony at play here of course. Degrowth would lead to fewer consumer products and services, fewer related jobs, and eventually a lower population. Less technological innovation. So less R&D into innovation means less innovation and fewer things in the future. Imagine this. Degrowth had started in the 70s, 80s or the 90s. What if the internet hadn’t exploded in use and usefulness over this time? You almost certainly wouldn’t have YouTube for example, and you wouldn’t have this channel complaining about economic growth. Indeed, you would have this same person or team complaining about the *lack* of growth and lack of cool things to buy and experience.

According to the video, green growth doesn’t work supposedly. And neither does decoupling. And so the conclusion is that degrowth is the only solution.

Here is a source showing decoupling at work: [https://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/articles/21-countries-reducing-carbon-emissions-growing-gdp/](https://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/articles/21-countries-reducing-carbon-emissions-growing-gdp/)

**The above source notwithstanding, we do produce a lot of waste and a lot of plastic and we do need reductions in emissions**. How is that going? Let’s look at a series of graphs. [https://imgur.com/a/FBgPThG](https://imgur.com/a/FBgPThG)

Let’s look at the story here. Firstly, aggregate world plastics production and cumulative production make for a very sobering reality. Just these on their own would seem to back up the idea that we need degrowth and that consumerism is bad. It’s not hard to imagine that the trajectory is not sustainable.

Global per capita emissions have perhaps surprisingly dipped in the past, and recently it looks like they might be rising again. Of course being global, this masks a lot of regional variability and there could be some large countries pushing that up, whilst other countries are actually lowering per capita emissions.

When looking at per capita plastic waste vs GDP per capita, there is a general upward trend, with some notable poorer nations that are doing particularly poorly in this regard that really stand out. There are some countries that are standouts in the opposite direction. But there is a sense from this graph that there is a chance that a wealthy democratic nation can become wealthier without the corresponding rise in plastics waste.

We then see that the US has actually made great strides in lowering carbon emissions per unit of GDP since the 1990s. It’s still above the other large nations, but those nations have also seen non-insignificant declines over this period too (other than perhaps Switzerland). But we then see that the US, EU and Australia are bottom of the world when it comes to the share of plastic waste that isn’t adequately managed. This would once again point to a future that is more positive, where it’s possible to grow the economy and still manage plastic waste.

Production vs consumption-based CO2 emissions per capita for Europe, Australia and the US having been trending down for at least a decade now. Overall world carbon efficiency is improving, a positive sign.

World per capita CO2 emissions relatively flat in the past decade or so, which masks rising per capita emissions in India, Brazil and China. However, the US really stands out when it comes to GDP per capita vs energy use in tonnes of oil equivalent per capita. We then see a clear decoupling of the UK economy with regards to GDP and Co2 emissions. The US is heading in that direction.

And so as the US example at the end shows us, the story of CO2 pollution, plastics production and GDP per capita is quite a complicated one. Clearly the US has a lot more work to do in this regard and stood out in the series of graphs. However, even as bad as the aggregate numbers are, the per capita numbers for the majority for the developed world are looking very encouraging. And there is hope that new technology can further reduce per capita CO2 emissions and plastics waste. For poorer nations, there is hope that by utilising the latest technology, they too can begin to lower emissions while enjoying robust growth. I hope the evidence I have presented thus far, alongside the graphs has helped paint a more optimistic picture of pollution and growth, but more importantly, a more realistic one.

>…No second home on the individual level. But ultimately degrowth cannot function as just individual lifestyle choices, systemic pathways, like subsidising all housing retrofits…redistributing all food waste, dramatically expanding public transportation methods…and a robust emphasis on low carbon care oriented jobs like educators, therapists and homecare providers are just some of the many ways to simultaneously improve the wellbeing of all while drastically reducing the global North’s consumption levels.

Let's tackle these 1 by 1.

You might say people shouldn’t be allowed to invest their money into a second home for example. Okay…but then where should they invest their money instead? The vast majority of American’s wealth is in their home. Such a mandate would not solve issues with emissions and waste nor help us toward a greener, more technologically efficient future.

What about a carbon tax. Like an emissions trading scheme. How is that working out for Europe? You can see via the followings links, [one](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/16/8804), [two](https://energytransition.org/2020/11/the-eus-emissions-trading-scheme-is-finally-becoming-a-success-story/), [three](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WP106-effectiveness-eu-emissions-trading-system.pdf) and [four](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/understanding-european-unions-emissions-trading-system), that it's not bad actually, as per the below links. It would be great to see this system implemented in other markets around the world to see the effects in different contexts. There is of course a lot of work left to do in this regard.

There are organisations that already redistribute food that would have gone to waste in most cities around the world. No need for mandates here.

Regarding public transport, it should be noted that public transport only works in high density cities. If their dream of degrowth occurs, we won’t have our dense cities anymore, and hence no need for public transport.

And there you go, now they want to mandate what kind of jobs should exist. What gives the team behind this channel the right to decide what kind of jobs should exist? What gives them the right to have their current jobs? What if someone else said that the people behind this team have jobs that are helping ruin the environment (ie. Contributing to YouTube and consumerism in general), how would the team respond to that charge?

>Highest per-capita consumers could cut their consumption rate by 95% and still live well with a combination of efficiency technologies and alternative lifestyle choices.

You can’t make this stuff up. How and where are these technologies going to come from if not for more investment and the prospects for future growth?

The rest of the video goes off the rails, but he does describe worker cooperatives, which is something that already exists. That’s a big topic in itself, I have another video which goes into that topic.

**Conclusion**

There isn’t anything else worth responding to in the video, but that doesn’t mean that we don’t have a problem with production, growth and waste right now. It’s worth looking into the complicated stats behind material’s use between 1900 and 1990.

Source 2. Page 33 \[UI = Intensity of material use\] These stats were collected in 1996, and the results cover the period 1900 to 1990. The story of material use (absolute and per capita) is a complicated one. Metals and minerals actually saw declining per capita use even as absolute use increased from 1970 to 1996. Forest products see relatively flat per capita usage over this period, meanwhile nonrenewable organics saw increased per capita use over this period. “Rogich found an increase in the absolute consumption of materials from 142 million metric tons in 1900 to 2.5 billion metric tons in 1989”.

However, Rogich finds that per unit of GNP, overall materials IU declined from 1970 to 1990, a trend he attributed to the fact that “services are contributing a growing share to our GNP.”

Page “The IU (weight per dollar GNP) for plastic, aluminum, potash, and phosphorous increased from 1900 to 1990, whereas IU for timber, copper, steel, and lead declined. For the entire U.S. economy Wernick and colleagues (1996) found that IU as measured by weight per dollar GNP declined by one-third from 1970 to 1990.”

Also, the author cautions that the use of less material (on a per capita basis) doesn’t necessarily translate to better for the environment. He cites a few examples, using aluminium instead of steal is actually more damaging to the environment, substituting wood with plastic pose significant disposal and recycling issues. Lighter cars use less petrol, but steel is easy to recycle whereas the composite materials used in lighter cars are difficult to recycle. So fuel consumption goes down, but there may be an overall increase in waste produced and resources consumed.

Source 3. The paper focuses on investment of the steel industry in Poland. They found that increased investment by the steel companies typically led to more efficiency, decreasing resource intensity for steel production. This was a study done between 2004 and 2018.

From Animal Spirits How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Hwy It Matters for Global Capitalism, pages 116-130, the authors state that the standard theory that people balance saving with consumption is wrong, and that people make poor spending choices all the time and undersave. We can say they are overconsuming, and thus this will make it harder to retire in old age. And so Superannuation schemes like what we have in Australia are popular because they take the choice from people and force people to save more for their retirement, so they are not a burden on the economy. People are forced not to be consumers so they are less of a burden to the government in old age. That could be seen as mandating against one of the pitfalls of consumerism, especially given people’s propensity to buy things they don’t necessarily need.

Source 1. Clearly the growth in the production of stuff, whether goods or services matters to our economy. Page 13, As Broadberry (1998, p. 376) concludes, “both Germany and the United States overtook Britain in terms of aggregate labor productivity largely by shifting resources out of agriculture and by improving comparative labor productivity in services rather than by improving comparative labor productivity in manufacturing.”

The paper argues that growth came first, allowing workers to move out of agriculture and into other industries. It wasn’t a matter of tariffs allowing people to leave agriculture and then go into manufacturing to help produce more stuff, that sort of thing came first and that allowed people to leave the agricultural sector. But this growth was not possible without the rising consumer demands of the time.

Here's a link to the relevant post: https://np.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/15ghog1/the_american_dream_is_dead/

Marginally snarkier blog version available [here.](https://jackthoughts.substack.com/p/no-it-was-never-normal-for-one-person)

R1: I don’t think 90% of the people reading this need it to be shown to them that this idea of American history is wrong, but apparently, thousands of people spending their time on Reddit think it's right, so let’s dive in. For the purposes of this post, I’m going to assume that “normal” means occurring at or close to the median for continuous variables like income, or in other cases where the variable in question is discontinuous, occurring for a plurality of Americans.

Incidentally, this idea of American life was directly contradicted in a paper I read for a class I took on poverty in America during my last semester of college. The relevant excerpt from [this paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/000271620157700102), written by historian Linda Gordon, says “there was never a time in U.S. history when the majority of men were able to support a wife and children single-handedly.” This statement cites three sources, but all of them were written pre-Great Depression, and usually, it’s the time spanning from 1945 to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 that people fawn over, so I’m going to look elsewhere for more information.

First, take a look at [the real median personal income in the US](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEPAINUSA672N), a measure of the income received by the middle American if you line everyone up in order of income, adjusted for changes in the average price level over time. This contradicts the narrative in the post: albeit with busts and booms, the “normal” American has been making more and more money since 1974, the earliest year recorded in the chart, adjusted for purchasing power. Even if there was a time when the typical American with a high school education could support a family of five with just their income and a handy housewife, that same American can now make even more money in the modern day…assuming they’re willing to (potentially) get a college degree, depending on the industry they go into. This chart doesn’t look exclusively at people with only a high school education, and I’m guessing you’ve heard about the [growing income gap between people with and without a college degree.](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/) It already seems doubtful that it's gotten harder for the typical American to pull off the lifestyle described in the linked post, but we're going to have to look elsewhere for data specifically on the earnings of those with just a high school education.

The St. Louis Fed has [data on this](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LEU0252917300A) going back to 1979. Between then and 2022, median nominal earnings among those with a high school education and no college degree have grown by about 242.6%, while the [price level as measured by the CPI](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL#0) has grown by about 303.14%. Looks like we can no longer dismiss this particular single-earner idea out of hand: wages haven't kept pace with prices for those without a college degree.

Not so fast. If you took a macro class and remember its content well, you'll know the CPI has its flaws. For one, it's calculated without adjusting for substitutions made by consumers. That's not the case for the PCE index, which we can apply directly to our data thanks to the magic of FRED. For simplicity's sake, I've indexed both earnings and the PCE to 1979 and divided the earnings index by the price index to show the change in real earnings in a way that can be easily understood in percentage terms. If earnings kept pace with prices exactly, the formula would just yield 100/100 = 1 for the final date. If they fell behind prices, we'd get a fraction less than one. [What do we see instead?](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=17yqB)

The median worker with only a high school education earned about 3.663% more in 2022 than in 1979. There have clearly been some rough times for this sort of person, but at the very least this data doesn't describe a downward trend.*

*(EDIT: There's an important point to attach to this, which I was made aware of thanks to /u/pepin-lebref : [Wages are down for men without a college education, relative to 1979.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=17yTL) This implies that the small bump observed above is due to increases in earnings among women. And to be a total pedant, yes, there are more than two genders, and no, that doesn't really affect the conclusion here. The important thing is that this part of the R1 was sort of wrong because it is harder for men, in particular, to pull off the single-earner lifestyle described in the tweet in 2022 compared to 1979.)

But let's focus on the point: was there ever a time when it was normal for a single earner to comfortably support a family of five with just a high school education? To our misfortune, there isn't a dataset looking specifically at the earnings of those with only a high school education adjusted for the cost of supporting a family of five over time. Putting together that data for every single year on record would be very time-consuming, so I’ll focus on 1979 before doing anything else.

The nominal median weekly wage in this data, in 1979, was $249. With one week of vacation time, that translates to $12,699 a year, but I’ll steelman the opposing idea a little and go with the 52-week figure of $12,948. Now all we need is the typical cost of living for a family of five in 1979. This kind of data is surprisingly hard to find, but I did find [data from the BLS](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/05/art3full.pdf) that includes the median nominal cost of living for a family of four in 1979. This measure includes the cost of entertainment, but I think it's fair to interpret ""comfortably"" as meaning ""with a reasonable amount of money spent on leisure, for the time."" That comes out to $16,129, exceeding the calculated median salary.

So no, it looks like it wasn’t normal for a single high school graduate to provide a comfortable standard of living to a family of five in 1979. The trouble here is that we can’t be sure the median earner with a high school education was both 1. making the same amount of money as the median earner with a high school education and two kids to take care of and 2. paying for the same basket of goods. But we’d have to make some great leaps from our limited data to assume it was really typical for one high school graduate to take care of a family of five comfortably: the budget we found was about 24.6% higher than the calculated salary, and we’re talking about somebody with three kids to take care of, not the two kids in the four-person family this budget was calculated for. Unless someone else responds to this with better (and contradictory) data, we should be able to reject the idea in the post I linked with a fair amount of certainty.

But maybe we just need to look further back. 1979 wasn’t that long ago, and as we all know, [everything started to get worse before then, in 1971.](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/) (Note for if you're just visiting the lands of BE: that site is fairly well known here for being very wrong about everything.) How about 1960?

I don't have the data to provide a clear picture of that time, but I do have [data on the prevalence of single-earner married-couple households in the US going back to 1967](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2014/ted_20140602.htm). (Props to /u/BernankesBeard for sharing a link to this data with me.) Back then, only about 35.6% of married-couple families had just the husband working, while 43.6% of them had both the husband and wife working. Just as described by Linda Gordon, the single-earner picture of families in the US doesn't accurately characterize the 60s (or at least the late 60s).

Nothing that I have shared here directly contradicts the idea that it used to be normal for a high school graduate in the US to support a family of five comfortably without anyone else bringing in income. And you might extrapolate backward from that BLS data on married-couple families to conclude it used to be normal for the husband to be the only worker. But even then, which type of family do you think tended to have three kids more often: the one with just one earner, or the one with multiple? It’s more likely that the three-child households in this data were concentrated among two-earner households, meaning it wasn't ""normal"" for a single earner to support a family of five back then. More likely, it was normal for two earners to support a family of five, because families with more kids need more money for them to be fed and clothed.

Limitations aside, it isn’t reasonable to look at the data we have and come to the conclusion that the idyllic economy the denizens of /r/facepalm wish they had used to be real in the United States. You have to make a lot of big assumptions to reach that conclusion:

1. Single-earner households were more common before 1967 than during that time, AND
2. A significant number of those households had three or more kids, AND
3. The earners in those households made more money than suggested by the data, AND/OR
4. A five-person household's budget would have been less expensive than suggested by the data, OR
5. The data is fabricated by THEM

Assumption 5 is my personal favorite. I wouldn't call this post conclusive, but until we get a better one, maybe we should stop getting so nostalgic for a time that, by all that we can tell, really didn't exist.",Skeeh,t2_y8jiy,0.91,317,117
737,5axofk,2016-11-03,badeconomics,Heck has no fury like a Wumbo scorned: political violence and selection bias,"""In which LordBufo forgot to renew his shitposting passport.""

I would like to thank badeconomics for inviting me here to discuss [Wumbo (2016)](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/57zb91/the_silver_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/d8x1ojw/). Wumbo's shitpost is a thought provoking and promising extension of applied wumbology to political philosophy. However, I have some suggestions regarding it's empirical strategy.

When evaluating the effect of any policies, [Heckman (2000)](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2000/heckman-lecture.pdf) reminds us that:

> Recognizing the potential importance of selection shapes the way we interpret economic and social data and gauge the effectiveness of social policy.

With that in mind, we revisit Wumbo (2016)'s claim that:

>Well, I expect socialists to be violent at heart because that's how all socialist governments have made sure they stayed in power.
 
Again, Heckman (2000) reminds us that:

> A sample selected by any rule not equivalent to random sampling produces a description of the population distribution of characteristics that does not accurately describe the true population distribution of characteristics no matter how big the sample size.

If socialists that form government undergo selection then we cannot naively infer the propensity for violence of the overall population. To understand whether or not we are concerned about selection it helps to have a theoretical model of the causality involved. For that, I suggest the framework developed by [Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2004)](http://economics.mit.edu/files/4469).

>economic institutions, and institutions more broadly, are *endogenous*; they are, at least in part, determined by society, or a segment of it

For a case study, I suggest 20th century Latin America as an interesting example. As we know from [Sala-I-Martin (1997)](http://www.nber.org/papers/w6252), Spanish colonies have suffered persistently low growth. Indeed, [Acemoglu and Robinson (2001)](http://economics.mit.edu/files/4123) explains that:

> The main objective of the Spanish and the Portuguese colonization was to obtain gold and other valuables from America. Soon after the conquest, the Spanish crown granted rights to land and labor (the encomienda) and set up a complex mercantilist system of monopolies and trade regulations to extract resources from the colonies.

Chile, as an ex Spanish colony, was saddled with extractive political and economic institutions. [Acemgolu, Egorov, and Sonin (2012)](http://economics.mit.edu/files/8797) develop a model of Latin American leftist populism: 

>Our starting point is that, as the examples suggest, the economies in question feature high levels of inequality and sufficiently weak political  institutions. These enable the rich elite (or a subset thereof) to have a disproportionate influence on politics. In fact, in many of these societies political corruption and political betrayal, where politicians use redistributive rhetoric but still end up choosing policies in line with the interests of the elite, are quite common This implies that voters often distrust politicians and believe that they may adopt a rhetoric of redistribution, leveling the playing field and defending the interests of the common man, but then pursue policies in the interests of the elite.  

Indeed, the socialists that rise to power in Latin America are likely to be populists responding to public anger about inequality and corruption. How is this linked to violence? [Acemoglu, Robinson, and Santos (2013)](http://economics.mit.edu/files/10402) study FARC violence in Columbia and argue:""

>Why are many states in less-developed societies unable to establish Weber’s famous monopoly of violence in their territories? The standard explanation relies on the inability of the central state to broadcast its power throughout the territories that it nominally controls and views an extension of this power to the periphery as a natural by-product of “political modernization”. In this paper we developed an alternative perspective, suggesting that the central state can develop (even “modernize”) without establishing such a monopoly of violence because there may be a symbiotic relationship between the parties controlling the central state and nonstate actors exercising power in the peripheries of the country. The origins of this symbiotic relationship is that nonstate armed actors can provide support to those controlling the central state. This
is particularly important in democracies where nonstate armed actors can control elections.

Extra legal violence can co-exist with states if the paramilitary groups have policy preferences in line with the politicians. In broad strokes, we now have the following model:

historical extractive institutions -> inequality -> populist anger -> ( violent paramilitaries <=> populist leaders)

The key here is that the leadership and violence are endogenous to historical institutions. To evaluate the inherent violence of socialists, we cannot rely on leaders in countries with histories of extractive institutions. 

Finally, in regards to a certain Chilean despot, [Acemoglu (2008)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/118d/93e80ec39ff7aee7ce92872766581612b2f6.pdf) reminds us that neoliberal economic reforms under non-inclusive politcal institutions is not necessarially better than redistribution under a politically inclusive institutions. (n.b. this is not to bash certain Chicago school economists who may have stuck their foot in their mouth by appearing to support Pinochet; the aforementioned scholar was a proponent of democratic governments and redistribution.) 

>Oligarchic societies not only protect the property rights of producers and prevent high levels of distortionary taxation, they also enable the politically   powerful elites to create a non–level playing field and a monopoly position for themselves. In contrast, democratic societies eschew the entry barriers that protect incumbent elites but create economic distortions in order to achieve a more egalitarian distribution of resources

Hoo, boy.   Here we go.   I can't guarantee this will be a good RI, but ah well.

OP argues:

>In an attempt to refute the so-called ""productivity-pay gap,"" some people have claimed that \[..\] ""total compensation has tracked productivity perfectly.""\[...\] There is only one problem with this happy narrative: it's factually wrong.  According to a 2016 report from the St. Louis Fed, ""labor productivity has been growing at a higher rate than labor compensation for more than 40 years.""\[..\] Similarly, a 2017 report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that ""since the 1970s, productivity and compensation \[defined as base pay plus benefits\] have steadily diverged.""

This is surprising, because according to [Kaldor's facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaldor%27s_facts), wages follow productivity pretty stably in the long run, so this would be a great surprise.   As it happens, it's inaccurate.

The BLS ([Brill et al. (2017)](https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-6/mobile/understanding-the-labor-productivity-and-compensation-gap.htm)) and St. Louis Fed reports ([Ravikumar & Shao (2016)](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2016/08/12/labor-compensation-and-labor-productivity-recent-recoveries-and-the-long-term-trend/)) plot real compensation and productivity using the CPI deflator, which obtains results that there has been a gradual gap since the 70s ([Chart 1, Brill et al. 'Understanding the labor productivity and compensation gap'](https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-6/images/productivity-and-compensation-chart-1.png),  [Figure 3, Ravikumar & Shao, 'Labor Compensation and Labor Productivity: Recent Recoveries and the Long-Term Trend'](https://files.stlouisfed.org/research/publications/economic-synopses/2016-08-12/labor-compensation-and-labor-productivity-recent-recoveries-and-the-long-term-trend.pdf)).   However, other authors don't, such as [Lawrence (2015)](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/growing-gap-between-real-wages-and-labor-productivity) and [Feldstein (2008)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w13953).

So what is the problem?

There are multiple.

Ravikumar & Shao measure labor productivity as "" real total output divided by total hours worked"", and Brill et al. puts it as ""real output per hour worked"". This seems normal enough.  However, the problem is in the nature of the productivity measures.    Real GDP=nominal GDP/GDP deflator.  You can use [NDP (net domestic product)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_domestic_product) to account for capital depreciation (NDP=GDP-depreciation), which no one, including labor, can consume, and some type of NDP deflator.   GDP and NDP deflators are [chained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chained_dollars).    But the CPI is a fixed-weight index, and because of this, prices will rise under the CPI faster than under GDP deflators.    [Figure 1; Church, ‘Comparing the Consumer Price Index with the gross domestic product price index and gross domestic product implicit price deflator”](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2016/images/church-figure1.png) illustrates the discrepancies between the CPI and GDP deflators--as can be seen, the CPI rises faster.  Source: ([Church 2016](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2016/article/comparing-the-cpi-with-the-gdp-price-index-and-gdp-implicit-price-deflator.htm)) Hence, a GDP or NDP deflator would rise slower than the CPI, and that productivity measures using GDP/NDP deflators would be higher than compensation measures using CPI as a deflator ([Figure 4; Lawrence, 'The Growing Gap Between Real Wages and Productivity'](https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/realtime/files/2015/07/lawrence20150721-figure4.png)), which means means you could get a productivity gap based purely on formula biases.

The other problem in using CPI in deflating compensation is that the CPI and NDP deflator measure different goods.   The NDP deflator, like the GDP deflator, would measure investment goods as well (Church 2016), whereas the CPI measures consumer goods.  This means there is additional composition bias added to the mix, so even if you could correct for formula bias, using the CPI is still not great. A better deflator for compensation might be the PCE (personal consumption expenditures) as, PCE and NDP deflator rise in tandem ([source](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1OoA)).

What are the BLS and St. Louis Fed measuring, then?   Probably the strongest case is that this is mostly attributable to wage inequality.  [Matt Rognlie](https://www.themoneyillusion.com/the-very-real-problem-of-wage-inequality/#comment-400287) gets really in depth—because of the methodological problems, a decline in the total share of labor is unlikely.  Wage inequality is likely what drives the gap reflected in productivity-pay graphs and the BLS and St. Louis Fed reports.

So the productivity compensation gap seen here is probably just good old wage inequality.

Edits to come as needed.

>In addition, part of the increase in total compensation reflects the increased cost of healthcare, which has [gone up significantly](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/report/2019-employer-health-benefits-survey/) in recent years. This causes an on-paper increase in benefits (as employers must pay more to provide coverage), but does not actually enhance wellbeing, and as such, it is a misleading indicator of worker compensation.

Well....kind of?    Total compensation reflects wages+benefits, so what this really reflects is an increase in healthcare expenditures.  If the real price of healthcare or insurance rose and employers did not cover it, compensation would decrease.    Given that health insurance is a large part of compensation, there does not seem to be any real economic reason against including it. ",Melvin-lives,t2_5838zdy2,0.95,211,25

741,cx6j9z,2019-08-29,badeconomics,"The ""Hot Hand Fallacy"" Fallacy: How a few top cognitive bias researchers fell into their own trap","The ""Hot Hand Fallacy"" is the idea that a current streak of good outcomes increases your likelihood of subsequent good outcomes. It comes from peoples' natural tendency to recognize patterns, even ones that aren't significant or may not even exist. The term was coined in a 1985 study that examined the discrepancy between how basketball players and fans saw streaks of good shooting, and their statistical reality.

In 1985, Gilovich, Tversky (two very foundational figures in behavioral economics), and Vallone penned a now famous paper titled *The Hot Hand in Basketball.* This paper used data from 1981 Philadelphia 76ers home games (presumably because 76ers publicist [Harvey Pollack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Pollack) kept the most in depth statistical records in the league) to study whether the ""hot hand"" phenomenon existed. The paper concluded that

> The belief in the hot hand and the “detection” of streaks in random sequences is attributed to a general misconception of chance 
according to which even short random sequences are thought to be highly rep-
resentative of their generating process.

In other words, the hot hand is just p-hacking. Patterns in player shooting streaks are just random variance in small samples of a larger dataset, which the human brain mistakes for a pattern. 

The paper gained massive attention, and the term 'hot hand fallacy"" entered the lexicon of both academic and pop science as a useful description of a common phenomenon, and the empirical findings became universal academic consensus for decades. It was not until nearly two decades later that some clever statisticians reexamined the study and found what really should have been clear from the start: **the empirical findings of *The Hot Hand in Basketball* flatly false, and the researchers made the exact mental mistake they were studying.** Driven by previous success in exposing cognitive bias, Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky drew false conclusions from a small sample of data.

The core problem with the study was sample size. The Gilovich et al looked at a sample of 48 games played in Philadelphia in the 1981 NBA season. This represents *less than 5%* of the 998 regular season and playoff games played in the 1981 NBA season, concentrated among a single group of players. The authors made a sweeping conclusion about the nature of streakiness in basketball based on less than 1/20th of an NBA season. That's absurd! This was first noted in a 2003 review of the study by Kevin B. Korb and Michael Stillwell ([pdf link](https://web.archive.org/web/20130927050854/http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~korb/iccs.pdf)), who examined the data and concluded that

> (Gilovich et al's) belief in having demonstrated the illusory
status of the Hot Hand is itself an illustration of the Law of
Small Numbers, for their statistical tests were of such low
power that they could not have been expected to find a Hot
Hand even if it were present.

And additionally

> The
only statistically significant results tend to support the
claim that there are too many runs for a single binomial
process, whereas the Hot Hand thesis would lead us to
expect the opposite.

In short, GVT used a sample size too small to draw a positive conclusion from, and then took the lack of positive conclusion as a negative conclusion.

As Korb and Stillwell suspected, newer studies have indeed shown the exact opposite of GVT's conclusion. Two studies in particular are the significant:

[A 2014 study presentes at the Sloan Analytics conference](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/content/the-hot-hand-a-new-approach-to-an-old-fallacy/) analysed all field goal attempts taken in the 2013 (25.6x larger sample than GVT), and additionally, used player tracking technology that records the distance of shots and the proximity of the closest defender. The study found that

> players who have outperformed over recent shots shoot from significantly further away, face tighter defense, and are more likely to take their team’s next shot. We then turn to the Hot Hand itself and show that players who are outperforming will continue to do so by a small but significant amount, once we control for the difficulty of the present shot.

[A 2011 study by Gur Yaari and Shmuel Eisenmann](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3187751/) examined 5 regular seasons of league-wide free throw shooting data (128x larger sample than GVT) found a

> statistically significance correlation between the results of consecutive free throw attempts. In our notation *P*(1|1)>*P*(1|0), an increase in the conditional probability (CP), which is usually referred to as a “hot hand”.

However, the authors also propose that

> The increase in the conditional probability is due to time fluctuations in the probability of success rather than a causal connection between the results of consecutive throws.

In other words, players don't become more likely to hit a subsequent shot after making the first, but instead enter sequences (i.e. games, quarters, free throw trips) more likely to make shots. This fits empirical data: because players are more likely to shoot better if they are in better health, or had 1+ rest days between games, or [get off Twitter earlier](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.www.complex.com/sports/2018/11/nba-players-late-night-tweets-harm-performance), players wake up on certain days more likely to hit shots than others, which creates inherent streakiness in player shooting. GVT's failure to find this in the data is a reflection of their miniscule sample size. And even if this form of streakiness isn't the first thing that comes to mind when people think ""hot hand,"" it is still the exact effect that GVT claimed did not exist: **even after adjusting for all in-game factors, individual players are more likely to make their next shot if they have made their last.**

Did GVT get some things right? Yes. The hot hand effect is likely much smaller than the average player or fan would assume. Part of this is because players in aggregate are much more likely to make a shot if they have made their last (good shooters are more likely to have made their last shot, and make their next), and certain in-game factors (mainly quality of opponent defense) may cause players to shoot better or worse, either of which may be confused with individual player streakiness. However, the principal finding of the study was empirically wrong, and the way they reached it should have raised flags when it was published. 

**In conclusion:**

Do people overestimate the hot hand effect in basketball? Probably

Is Gilovich et al's *The Hot Hand in Basketball* a useful study? No

If an individual basketball player has made their last shot, does that indicate a greater likelihood of making their next shot? Yes",BEE_REAL_,t2_ldfnk,0.98,232,53
742,170jls8,2023-10-05,badeconomics,The Great Society Didn’t Destroy Black America,"In our last post, we covered every economic claim made during the second Republican debate. Except one. An outlandish comment made by Senator Tim Scott was so broad and laden with historical baggage that I decided it needed its own post. Here it is:

“Black families survived slavery; we survived poll taxes and literacy tests; we survived discrimination being woven into the laws of our country; what was hard to survive was Johnson’s Great Society where they decided to put money, where they decided to take the black father out of the household to get a check in the mail. And you can now measure that in unemployment, in crime, in devastation.""

The implication that the Great Society programs wrought more long-lasting destruction to Black families than slavery was roundly mocked by most of the media (though defended in The Wall Street Journal). The New Republic panned it as “embarrassing,” while The New York Times’ Nikole Hannah-Jones openly wondered how it must feel to need to “disgrace your ancestors to have a chance [in a Republican primary].”

But Scott is far from alone in his assertions. Famous Black economists like Walter Williams and Thomas Sowell have spent the last half century contending that government programs intended to help Black Americans have done more harm than good. (This blog will review Sowell’s recently-released book in the coming weeks.) Scott’s comments are an echo of Williams’ words a decade sooner:

“The welfare state has done to black Americans what slavery couldn't do….And that is to destroy the black family.”

So, how did it supposedly do so? First, we better talk about the history of the welfare state.

The federal government’s involvement in providing welfare benefits took off in the 1930s during the Great Depression. With millions of Americans out of work, waiting in bread lines for food while meager state unemployment funds dried up, mass mobilizations of Americans demanded action from the federal government, and FDR delivered. In the 1930s, Americans gained Social Security, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC, what is colloquially called welfare), a federal unemployment insurance system, a national labor relations bill, a vast array of public works projects resulting in the federal government directly employing over 8 million Americans, and the first bill setting national standards for wages and hours nationwide. After the Great Depression passed, Americans (increasingly even Black Americans) enjoyed broader prosperity alongside the nation’s growing welfare state. 

The second major expansion of the welfare state, more modest than the first, could not claim to be backed by a mass mobilization (except on civil rights) like the one that drove Roosevelt. While radical critics of the American economy, among them Martin Luther King Jr., were calling for new federal measures like a guaranteed universal income and a massive public jobs program, they were ignored. Still, Johnson passed many important reforms including the establishment of Medicare and Medicaid, the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts, the expansion of food stamps, increased funds for poor school districts and Head Start for early childhood education, the Child Nutrition Act, and a reform to AFDC that would do more to incentivize work, all while overseeing one of the fastest real increases in the minimum wage. However, in the years after LBJ left office, America didn’t enjoy the same prosperity it did in its postwar years. High inflation, the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam war, deindustrialization, and the sexual revolution created a whole new country, for better and for worse, and many of the costs of this transformation were disproportionately borne by Black families.

According to its critics, the Great Society programs were largely responsible for driving Black Americans out of work, breaking up their families, and creating the sort of social or moral decay that resulted in the uprisings of the late 1960s and the longstanding issues of crime, unemployment, and single-parents homes in Black communities. However, as we’re about to see, the evidence for these propositions is slim and mixed at best. We’ll prioritize three topics here: wages, welfare, and the family.

Wages

The first labor laws to be subjected to the criticism of anti-Great-Society conservatives are actually FDR’s reforms in the aftermath of the Great Depression. Here’s a summary of that critique from Thomas Sowell:

“From the late nineteenth-century on through the middle of the twentieth century, the labor force participation rate of American blacks was slightly higher than that of American whites. In other words, blacks were just as employable at the wages they received as whites were at their very different wages. The minimum wage law changed that. Before federal minimum wage laws were instituted in the 1930s, the black unemployment rate was slightly lower than the white unemployment rate in 1930. But then followed the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933 and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938 – all of which imposed government-mandated minimum wages, either on a particular sector or more broadly… By 1954, black unemployment rates were double those of whites and have continued to be at that level or higher.”

Sowell gets some things right here. Black and white unemployment rates were roughly equal in 1930, and they remained so in the 1940 census, despite all of the policies Sowell mentioned having taken effect. The Black unemployment rate would not become nearly double the white rate until the 1950 census. 


But it’s more than a bit misleading to blame FDR’s labor laws for nationwide changes that appeared in the national data roughly ten years after their first implementation. Breaking down the census data Sowell uses by region provides much-needed clarity. The Black/white unemployment ratio was already nearly 2 to 1 in large parts of the North in 1930. Similarly, Black unemployment was lower than white unemployment nationwide because Black Americans disproportionately lived in the South where the unemployment rate was consistently lower than the rest of the country. The low wages, sharecropping system, and dependency of tenant farmers (not to mention the region’s relative lack of reliance on the financial sector) kept a great share of the population at work.

Sen. Sanders hopes to make all 4 year state colleges free. This is a terrible idea in the way he is implementing it. 

He states that colleges must reduce ballooning costs, but then states they cannot rely on low-paid adjunct faculty, while at the same time claiming that they must hire new faculty, provide for professional development, and increase academic opportunities for students.  So he is somehow expecting a state to cut the cost and increase the spending on the program, I think there’s an accounting problem.

>No funding under this program may be used to fund administrator salaries, merit-based financial aid, or the construction of non-academic buildings like stadiums and student centers

So he wants hundreds of thousands of new students to get into schools but doesn’t want to pay for the administrators needed to handle that many new kids?

Plus I’m all for no stadium spending but there is infrastructure needed to support these thousands of students you want to be going to these universities that will require massive funding. Where are they all going to eat, study, and sleep?

>Student loan interest rates would be cut almost in half for undergraduate students, dropping from 4.32% to just 2.32%. 

Great I still have 40,000 in debt but my interest rate is cut in half. While I have to compete with students that as Sen. Sanders claims will be going to college debt free.  So not only will he make my degree worth less because it will be easier for people to get and there will be more people with it, he is also giving them less of a financial burden to have to overcome on the other side. Why does anyone with a college degree like this plan?

>Fully paid for by imposing a Robin Hood tax on Wall Street


http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b9b40fee-9236-11e2-851f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz4786eAj5P

Sweden tried this at a lower level than what Sanders proposes. Their trading volume fell by 60% and collected less than 20% of what they expected to collect. On top of this most firms moved to London and other major financial centers. Once the tax was removed trading resumed at a near previous level after 3 years. It’s a terrible idea to pay for a bad idea.

Now theres a specific point he doesn’t cover that’s very important. He likes to compare this system to Germany and other Nordic countries. He doesn’t however mention how he will control degrees. There is a massive skills gap right now because people get degrees in things that are not currently useful. There is social value to these degrees but there isn’t a direct economic benefit. These degrees used to have the issue of creating a lot of debt with little job prospect but once you take away the debt portion doesn’t it just create a way for someone to take 4 year vacation? 

If he were to implement a German model than it would be a very controlled system where only those who qualify can get in, there is only a set number of each degree available, and the companies help sponsor the students. He is in no way shape or form proposing this system.

Now the claim that the gender wage cap doesn't exists is wrong on two accounts I will bring up. [Firstly that women on the whole earn .75:1 as compared to men](http://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/archive/highlights-of-womens-earnings-in-2013.pdf). Now the clear problem with this statistic is that women generally choose lower paying careers or have career path's interrupted more greatly parenthood then men do. I would argue that this is a problem but what I suspect the poster's point is that when you control for other variables that the wage gap disappears. However this is also wrong [as is pointed out here](http://www.hawaii.edu/religion/courses/Gender_Wage_Gap_Report.pdf) with an ""adjusted gender wage gap that is between 4.8 and 7.1 percent"". Now obviously 4.8-7.1% is a far cry from 25% as is sometimes claimed this is clearly NOT ""equal pay for equal work"" so it would be ludicrous to say that the gender wage gap *doesn't* exists, just that it isn't a strong as the media would sometimes have implied.

Okay this is a really simple R1. Now he would be right if what he is talking about is the noise involved in such a statistic because clearly on a case by case basis a high school dropout could easily out earn a Ph D. with straight A's. [However, as we can see for degrees](http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm) we clearly see large differences in the aggregate. Now we also need to look at the oppritunity cost of going to college but even accounting for that https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci20-3.pdf granted this only looks at a bachelors degree but I would be unwilling to say that getting an advanced degree that isn't a professional degree is likely to be the best finical decision. Finally grades do not generally have a casual relationship to income but they [defiantly correlate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/05/20/heres-how-much-your-high-school-grades-predict-how-much-you-make-today/).

For the purpose of this R1 I am going to interpreter this comment as being generally anti-Obama care and not, as is the literal interpretation, that 
Obama-care doesn't exists. Largely there are two way you could judge the effectiveness of a given health care policy  (so far as I can tell. I would not be surprised to learn I am wrong). Those are the relative levels of enrollment (i.e. what enrollment was before and after the policy) and the relative costs of health care i.e. what the cost of health care was before and after the policy). [As Krugman points out here](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/23/opinion/health-reform-lives.html) post Obama-care enrollment is up and insurance premiums are down. At the very Obama-care at least seems like less of a lie then the commenter seems to imply.

Found and article of /r/economy (my first mistake) about how half of well-paying jobs required coding. This comment was on the top.


>This is because software is a tax-free rent source, so people are still investing in it because the returns are potentially astronomical.

First of all, it's not tax-free. The coders are taxed on income and the firm is taxed on profits. I really don't understand how this is different from anything else. Although it's not specifically stated, this behaviour is rent seeking... or something. However, at least OP understands that due to the high productivity of coding as evidenced by the high salaries, their potential returns are astronomical. 

>The software being created isn't all that useful, but it's potentially extremely valuable.

Why? I imagine most software is useful in the sense that it helps increase somebody's utility. Even candy crush is useful and most software is used in production or analytics so even more ""useful."" Also, it's not like software is a luxury good like a Rolex which would have less use than say a car. Anyways, this part is so dumb I can't even.

>This creates artificially high demand in a market where there's very little potential for returns elsewhere.

Firms can make more money by creating code than other activities in the economy. This requires coders. Coders wages are increased. I don't see anything artificial about it since the whole premise of tax-free rent seeking is insane in this case.

On occasion, he actually calls himself an economist. He generally writes about how America is imploding any day now, and everything is collapsing, and so on. Of course, he has absolutely no idea what he's talking about and routinely gets even basic stats wrong. I'll be R1ing a few things he wrote.

>I was surprised to read today — as you were, perhaps — that the American unemployment rate fell in May, to 13 percent or so... **The unemployment rate — the real one — is higher than 16%**

This is good economics. There was a mistake in the BLS jobs report where some employees were mistakenly counted as employed, and the BLS estimates the real unemployment rate is about 3% higher than the official rate (putting it at about 16.3%).

>The true unemployment rate isn’t falling; it’s climbing. **Not my opinion — the government’s own admission.**

And here is where he can't read. The unemployment rate still fell because [this error was present](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_05082020.htm) in April as well, where the unemployment rate was under-stated by *almost 5%* (meaning it should have been about 19.7%). The ""official"" rate fell from 14.7% to 13.3%. The corrected rate fell from \~19.7% to \~16.3%. It went down either way. I don't know if this is bad economics or just bad reading comprehension.

>So how high is it? My guess is it’s about 20% at the moment.

And then he adds an extra 4% to the unemployment rate for literally no reason at all.

From ""[The economy is self-destructing](https://eand.co/the-economy-is-self-destructing-dc66efa26b2f)"" (August 23):

Here, Umair is referring to the labor force participation rate (LFPR) (and links to it on FRED). I will take a slight issue with him calling it ""working age"" Americans though--the [labor force](https://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm#L) includes all those 16 and older in the civilian non-institutional population. My 96 year old retired great-aunt is still included in the denominator of the LFPR, but not many people would consider her ""working age"". What most people call the ""working age"" labor force participation would be for those [age 25-54](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300060). It's a semantic issue, but I think it's one worth clarifying when you're audience likely has little to no formal economics knowledge. This is also important because at least *part* of the decline in labor force participation rates has been [due to demographic changes](https://www.frbatlanta.org/chcs/labor-force-participation-dynamics.aspx) (mainly the fact that a lot of people got old and retired). He also later uses some very funny rounding to imply the LFPR dropped by 10%, but the reality is more like \~4%.

He then switches to talking about the employment rate, where he fucks that up too.

>Just a quarter of working age Americans had good jobs pre-Covid. The rest? Another quarter had crap jobs, “low-income service jobs,” which in plainer English are go-nowhere McJobs, Uber drivers, and so forth. ***And the remaining roughly half of working age America wasn’t employed at all.***

This is just plainly false. Exactly how false depends on how we define ""working age"". If we look at the [employment-population ratio](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EMRATIO) (again, including all those 16 and older that aren't institutionalized), then roughly 39% of ""working age America"" didn't have a job pre-COVID. But if you think my great-aunt isn't working age (as I happen to believe), then we should likely put some better age parameters on this. If we look at the [employment rate of those ages 15-64](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LREM64TTUSM156S), then about 29% didn't have a job pre-COVID. If we define [working age as 25-54](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LREM25TTUSM156S) (hopefully keeping many full-time students and early retirees out), then it was more like 20%.

And just to explain this since many readers here aren't experts in economics, I think this is worth clarifying. Measures like the LFPR or the employment rate includes people that have *no desire to work* in the denominator (meaning most of those people that have no job aren't looking for one). Maybe they're a student, disabled, retired, staying home and taking care of kids, too busy posting misleading ""economics"" on Medium, or whatever else. Point being, there are many people that *aren't* working for perfectly fine reasons--that doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. Or maybe something is wrong, but you're going to have to look a lot deeper than ""Some people don't have jobs!"" to find out.

From ""[(How Social Democracy Liberated Europeans From) How Capitalism Exploits Americans](https://eand.co/how-social-democracy-liberated-europeans-from-how-capitalism-exploits-americans-9920464c25db)"":

>The numbers say that only 5% of Americans work second jobs — but again, that’s a poor representation of reality...  A better number comes from **Gallup**. How many people did they find work “multiple jobs”, counting the gig economy? Wait for it, the number’s kind of shocking. **About 40% of Americans work more than one job.** Wait — what?

And one last time, Umair is incapable of reading. He's referring to [this report from Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/240929/workplace-leaders-learn-real-gig-economy.aspx), which does in fact say 36% of workers are in the gig economy (using a *very* broad definition of ""gig jobs""). But if you go to page 8 of that report, it has [this wonderful chart](https://imgur.com/a/85qcRy2). If you add up all the categories of two-job holders, you arrive at 22%, not 40%.

So, let's start with selected badecon from the article:

>On January 6, 2004, Senator Charles Schumer and I challenged the erroneous idea that jobs offshoring was free trade in a New York Times op-ed. Our article so astounded economists that within a few days Schumer and I were summoned to a Brookings Institution conference in Washington, DC, to explain our heresy. In the nationally televised conference, I declared that the consequence of jobs offshoring would be that the US would be a Third World country in 20 years.

>That was 11 years ago, and the US is on course to descend to Third World status before the remaining nine years of my prediction have expired.

**R1 the first**: Minor pedantry on my part, and not necessarily badecon, but third world status is a stupid, stupid stereotype.  Ireland is a third world country.  Brazil is a third world country.  Austria (huehuehue) is a third world country.  These are all industrialized, moderately prosperous places.  What he means is that our economy is on track to tank.

[No...no, it's not.](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/fredgraph.png?g=2mpI)  14% GDP growth in a decade that included one of the worst recessions in memory is nothing to sneeze at.

>The evidence is everywhere. In September the US Bureau of the Census released its report on US household income by quintile.

**R1 the second**:  Yeah, the Census numbers are grim for several reasons, but I'll only talk about one.  (Lifted from [Where Has All the Income Gone?](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/where-has-all-the-income-gone)):

The price index calculated by the CB overstates inflation relative to other, better price indexes.  This ends up making actual income gains look like they shrink due to higher prices.

Here's how Craig gets hand-wavey over this: 

>The Census Bureau uses official measures of inflation to arrive at real income. These measures are understated. If more accurate measures of inflation are used (such as those available from shadowstats.com)

**mini R1**: shadowstats is not an acceptable source.

But seriously, read Minneapolis Fed paper.  It's fantastic.

>The departure of well-paid US manufacturing jobs was soon followed by the departure of software engineering, IT, and other professional service jobs.

**R1 the third and last because I'm lazy and this is getting long**:

[Here's the past decade of manufacturing job growth.](http://i.imgur.com/EsKRBaU.png)  And [here's the last decade of professional (technical) services job growth](http://i.imgur.com/A72mk3F.png).

751,9oc9rm,2018-10-15,badeconomics,"Sowell: ""Minimum wage increases unemployment""","> Supply-and-demand says that above-market prices create unsaleable surpluses, but that has not stopped most of Europe from regulating labor markets into decades of depression-level unemployment.

—Bryan Caplan, quoted by Thomas Sowell, Basic Economics, Fifth Edition, page 220.

>Minimum wage laws make it illegal to pay less than a government-specified price for labor.  By the simplest and most basic economics, a price artificially raised tends to cause more to be supplied and less to be demanded than when prices are left to be determined by supply and demand in a free market.  The result is a surplus, whether the price that is set artificially high is that of farm produce or labor.

Sowell argues that minimum wage is the cause of unemployment, in essence, and that higher minimum wage leads to higher unemployment.  This is, of course, plainly not backed up by empirical evidence.

Several papers have examined the economics of unemployment and labor, notably *Population, Unemployment and Economic Growth Cycles: A Further Explanatory Perspective* (Fanati et al, 2003).  Fanati and Manfredi observe several things, notably that unemployment may increase or decrease fertility rates.  If welfare is sufficient that unemployment is favorable to fertility, higher unemployment tends to increase fertility rates, and thus higher unemployment rates can self-sustain.

Raising the minimum wage reduces job opportunities:  ceteris parabus, the same consumer spending must concentrate into fewer workers's hands.  The economy will of course respond in all kinds of ways; this is only the basic, one-variable outcome.

If welfare is sufficiently high, then fertility rates will increase, so suppose Fanati and Manfredi, sustaining this increased unemployment rate.

What if we raised the minimum wage so far that welfare is significantly lower than minimum wage, or otherwise increased that gap—such as by phasing out welfare well into lower-middle-income or providing a universal basic income or universal dividend?

Loss of employment would entail loss of means, negatively impacting fertility decisions.  This suggests a higher minimum wage leads, long-term, to reduced population growth and control of unemployment—which seems to be exactly what happens in many nations with high minimum wages and strong welfare states.

Labor isn't generally constrained by the supply of labor, either.  Later retirement, early entry into the workforce, and migrant labor all can move to fill labor demand; and a loss of labor demand will reduce the marginal benefits of immigrating into a nation (high unemployment tends to make immigrants look somewhere else for job opportunities, and nations stop accepting legal immigrant laborers).

In other words: the demand for laborers creates the supply of laborers; demand for jobs by workers doesn't create jobs.  Demand for goods provides revenue and a need for labor, which creates demand for laborers—jobs—and otherwise the revenue to pay those laborers doesn't exist, and the jobs cannot be supplied.  Thus the demand is for goods, which creates demand for labor, which affects immigration and fertility decisions to increase supply of labor.

The observation that great welfares increase supply of labor is not wrong; it's only contextual.  The observation that greater minimum wages increase supply of labor is patently-absurd, as population growth is affected by decisions based around the economics of supporting that population growth, and minimum wage artificially gates access to means—minimum wage increases, ceteris parabus, reduce the number of jobs available, thus reducing the number of people who can access resources, acting as a general constraint of resource availability.

The crux the original post comes down to the meaning of ""support"". In any society individuals spend between 30-70 hrs/week working at home and in commerce. In the second half of the 20th century, this was very sexually dimorphic, [men performed ~5x as much commercial labour as women](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-weekly-hours-worked-per-person-by-age-group-united-states?time=earliest..2005), and women performed [~10x as much household labour as men](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/weekly-hours-dedicated-to-home-production-in-the-usa-by-gender). Ramey & Francis (2009) find women work a few more hours than men, but Aguiar & Hurst (2006) find the [reverse](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/hours-per-week-spent-in-market-and-non-market-work-by-sex-united-states).

This gradually, but in an anthropological sense rather rapidly, changed over the 19^th and 20^th centuries. Firstly, [because of the automation](https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/share-of-us-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances_1350.webp), secondly, because of the the increasing availability of outsourcing/commercialization of much home production (e.g. processed food, public school, etc.).

>First, take a look at the real median personal income in the US... the “normal” American has been making more and more money since 1974

While it is indeed true that median income has risen in the US, we need to think about this in terms of opportunity costs and counterfactuals.

- In two adult family households, having both adults engage in the commercial labour force brings about a whole bunch of new costs: childcare, another commute, possibly another vehicle, more commercially prepared meals, more taxes, increased capital intensity in home production (think washing machines), etc. This doesn't mean that there were *no gains* from the entry of women into the commercial labour market, but they're not as large as ""graph go up"" might seem to imply. 

- When we account for [education levels alone](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=17Avf), it can be observed that wages have underperformed output for every education level. 

- The age structure of the labour force is [shifting upwards](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/median-age-labor-force.htm) towards the period when earnings peak.

- When we look strictly at men without college education working full time, their wages have [unambiguously fallen](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=17AAm), and this isn't even accounting for ageing.

The argument usually made here is that productivity must have declined, I don't buy this. Wage's have underperformed productivity even for the sector of the economy that is allegedly driving output growth, and [rising productivity in one sector is expected to lift earnings in other sectors anyway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol_effect). 

---

All of this actually misses a big part of why so many people exhibit this frustrated attitude about cost of living. In particular medical care, education, vehicles, and housing have all become increasingly expensive relative to other goods and services (I don't even need to cite this one), and they're all considered ""essentials"". Unlike with ""essentials"" such as food and fuel (which have seen prices gradually fall), these are not frequent purchases that can easily be adjusted to price changes: you either need a lot of savings *now* (which young people generally don't have) or you need to lock in and commit to paying a fixed cost over time (it is very difficult to convince banks that *your* earnings will rise, even if it's statistically likely), which produces a lot of uncertainty and frustration.

And that frustration is justified. [There are lots of adults  who can't afford to live on their own](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2018/01/31/more-adults-now-share-their-living-space-driven-in-part-by-parents-living-with-their-adult-children/). I can't find a series for how many medical driven bankruptcies have changed over the years, but it's well established as a [leading factor](https://pnhp.org/new_bankruptcy_study/Bankruptcy-2009.pdf#page=3).

Finally, you cannot quite show that the poor in America have higher consumption than they used to to ""debunk"" the original post. In the eyes of most people, being dependent upon transfer payments to sustain consumption levels does not equate to being ""self supporting"", and so transfer payment increases that have offset growing inequality do not fully offset the psychosocial effects of that inequality.",pepin-lebref,t2_6dhue4kw,0.59,22,85

Let’s start with this section of the article:

>As for the alarm about too many old people and not enough young, that reads like a weird science-fiction story — the old need caring for, and young people can’t take care of them while doing all the other jobs that need doing. Crisis!

>It sounds like full employment to me.

>Note that full employment as a concept carries political weight, because economists tend to say there is a “natural” unemployment rate of around 5 percent, and if this rate goes lower, it’s bad for … profits, basically. If unemployment dips below 5 percent, the thinking goes, the labor market tightens and the stock market gets depressed, because there is more competition for workers, and higher wages need to be offered to grab available workers, so profits drop, and inflation might occur, etc.

Some background information: [full employment means that the unemployment rate is equal to the natural unemployment rate](http://faculty.washington.edu/ezivot/econ301/301l5_1.htm), which *is* estimated to be around 5%. [Natural unemployment arises from difficulties in matching employees with employers](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/03/06/what-is-u/). People move between jobs, get fired or laid off, and sometimes are only just entering the workforce recently, and haven’t found a job yet. The natural unemployment rate is also known as the NAIRU, or the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. When the unemployment rate is higher than this rate, there’s a lot of people competing for jobs, and so wages fall, causing prices and thus inflation to fall as well. The opposite occurs when the unemployment rate is lower than the NAIRU: employers compete for workers, wages rise, and inflation rises as well. [This is described in the Phillips curve](https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2020/january/what-is-phillips-curve-why-flattened). However, as described in the linked article, this relationship has weakened in the US due to the efforts of the Federal Reserve to keep inflation low and stable.

In this case, what Robinson is describing is an aging population dipping below the natural rate of unemployment due to the increase in the number of old people. This doesn't make sense, because demographic factors change the NAIRU itself. Young people are unemployed at a higher rate than older people and are responsible for a larger part of the NAIRU due to how often they are only recently entering the labor force, or have gotten laid off. So, when the population ages, the NAIRU falls, because young people then make up a smaller share of the population.

What *does* happen when the population ages? In a previous version of this post I used the example case of Japan to show that it forces people to work more and retire later in life, but that’s primarily due to Japanese cultural standards that encourage work, which have existed for decades. (However, I will say that the aging population has probably reinforced those standards by creating a justification for them.) [What Japan does have because of its aging population is an unusually low unemployment rate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/business/japan-unemployment.html), because [the aging population is causing a labor shortage.](https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&context=geog_masterpapers) Additionally, it’s making it hard for the government to maintain its social security system.

Now, I’m going to go out on a limb and prax my way through the overworking part. If the global population declined due to lower birth rates, the workforce would shrink compared to the retirement age population. Consequently, people in the labor force would have to either become more productive, work longer hours, or retire later in life, in order to maintain the current standard of living. Increased productivity would be great, but the workforce can’t spontaneously become more productive when it’s convenient, and so longer hours and later retirement would ensue. Normally, you could solve this problem by encouraging immigration, but we’re talking about a global population decline: we can’t import more workers from Mars. We'd merely be shifting the problem around, which could dampen the effects in some places, but it wouldn't eliminate the problem.

Robinson is correct that [wages rise when the labor market is tight](https://www.epi.org/blog/evidence-that-tight-labor-markets-really-will-increase-labors-share-of-income-economic-policy-institute-macroeconomics-newsletter/). But if the population ages, [more of what workers produce will be focused on taking care of the elderly, diverted away from other things like education and infrastructure spending](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/05/02/two-solutions-to-the-challenges-of-population-aging/). This diversion of resources is already occurring in Japan.

>In other words, the precarity and immiseration of the unemployed would disappear as everyone had access to work that gave them an income and dignity and meaning (one new career category: restoring and repairing wildlands and habitat corridors for our cousin species)

I don’t have much to say about this except 1. there’s no reason to expect that unemployed people would either cease to exist or stop being unhappy with the fact that they don’t have a job, and 2. “dignity and meaning” is fairly subjective and there’s no reason to expect that people would have more of it if they’re overworked, retiring later, and directing more of their money towards the elderly.

>The 20th century’s immense surge in human population would age out and die off (sob), and a smaller population would then find its way in a healthier world. To make this work, their economic system might have to change — oh my God! But they will probably be up to that mind-boggling task.

Sometimes it’s best to take a step back from economic systems and think about what you have to work with. Populations that are older on average have fewer young people and more old people. The young will have to work more to provide for the old, or the old will have to work more, in order to maintain the current standard of living. There’s no convoluted escape from that fact involving the tax code or who owns what. As we’ve explored, that’s a big problem. Maybe if you perfected the law, you could accelerate technological growth and bring your fully automated luxury gay space communism dreams to life, but that’s not what the author is suggesting. (At least, I hope not, given how impractical that would be.)

756,cnetce,2019-08-08,badeconomics,Are labour markets currently tight? How do we know?,"So the intent of this effortpost is mostly to clarify a couple concepts for people who may not have an extensive economics background, and hopefully give an overview of the main issues and arguments around the current state of the U.S./developed world labour market(s). Hopefully it will serve as a good refresher/basic reference for future discussions as well.

**What is meant by a ""tight"" labour market?**

There are several ways to define a tight labour market. For the purposes of this post, a tight labour market could be defined as one where the unemployment rate is low relative to its ""usual"" level. By that definition, the U.S. labour market is currently very tight, with the lowest unemployment rate since the late 60s ([Graph](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)).

**Indicators of a tight labour market**

A low unemployment rate is correlated with many other indicators; for instance, a high job openings rate:

The job openings rate is the ratio of job openings to total labour demand (job openings + current employment). So a high job openings rate means that employers have a hard time finding qualified workers to satisfy demand for their products. Usually, the unemployment rate and job openings rate are [inversely correlated](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=oArv), a phenomenon which is probably best visualised by a [Beveridge curve](https://www.bls.gov/charts/job-openings-and-labor-turnover/job-openings-unemployment-beveridge-curve.htm). *Usually*, this is expected to be a line or curve going from the upper left (tight labour market, low unemployment and high job openings) to the lower right (loose labour market, high unemployment and low job openings). As can be seen, there seems to have been a shift of the Beveridge curve towards a state with a higher job openings rate after the Great Recession, for reasons that are still under debate.

Maybe more importantly, a low unemployment rate tends to be correlated with accelerating inflation, also known as the [Phillips curve](https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/images/uploads/2018/Figure%205_20181015032933.jpg) ([another graph](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20171104_WOC123.png)). These Phillips curve were quite popular until the 90s, but as the graphs show, the relationship became much weaker afterwards. There are a number of theories that attempt to explain this: for instance, it's possible inflation expectations have become so well anchored that inflation is simply less responsive to changes in the unemployment rate than it was before.

**NAIRU**

A concept related to the Phillips curve is the NAIRU: Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment. Also sometimes called the ""natural"" or ""neutral"" rate of unemployment, this is the rate such that, if the actual unemployment rate falls below, inflation starts to pick up. Conversely, when the unemployment rate is above the NAIRU, inflation remains stable or starts decreasing. Note that the relationship may well be *non-linear*: maybe for an unemployment rate above the NAIRU, even significantly above, inflation is stable, but as soon as the unemployment rate falls below the NAIRU, inflation will start accelerating. Estimating the NAIRU is very difficult, precisely because the Phillips curve has become so flat in recent years, as well as the fact that the NAIRU can change over time.

**Why is inflation so low?**

This brings up a question, though: if the unemployment rate is the lowest in about 5 decades, how come inflation is still around 2%? Are we not almost certainly below the NAIRU? There a couple theories that have come up to answer this, but I'll concentrate on one in particular, which was the main reason why I decided to attempt writing this post: the theory that the unemployment rate no longer represents the proper state of the labour market, and other indicators may have become more relevant.

To better understand this theory, a good start is to look at the [labour for participation rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CIVPART). The long rise until the 90s is mostly due to [increasing participation by women in the labour market](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300002), but notice the fall after the recession in 2008. Remember that the unemployment rate is the ratio of unemployed workers *to the civilian labour force*: is it possible that the unemployment rate is low, not because there are few unemployed workers, but because those unemployed workers are classified by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) as being ""out of the labour force"", rather than ""unemployed""?

[According to the BLS](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm#unemployed), a person is counted as ""unemployed"" if: they don't have a job, they are currently available for work (not sick, at school, etc.), *and* have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks. So, it's possible that some of those workers who got laid off during the Great Recession simply feel they have no chance of getting a job and are not actively looking, even though they (given the high rate of job openings) they might have a reasonable chance of finding an opportunity if they looked. Those people would be classified as ""out of the labour force"" and would ""disappear"" from the official unemployment rate statistics, so to speak. This could explain the decline in the labour force participation rate, and also the lack of inflation despite the low unemployment rate: employers can still find workers by convincing people out of the labour force to come back and work for them.

**Counterarguments**

Personally, I'm not completely convinced by this explanation, for a couple reasons. To start with, the BLS actually ask people out of the labour force why they are not looking for work. If an individual answers that they simply don't think they would find a job if they looked, and that is the main reason for not actively looking for a job (as opposed to being sick, in school, retired, and so on), they are considered to be ""discourage workers"". And if an individual has been unemployed for less than 12 months or have acively looked for work in the last 12 months, they are considered to be marginally attached (discouraged workers are a subset of marginally attached workers). So, what if, instead of looking at unemployed workers as a percentage of the labour force, we looked at (unemployed workers + discouraged workers) as a percentage of (labour force + discouraged workers)? [Here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U4RATE) is the result: this rate is *also* low relative to its historical average. So discouraged workers can't be the explanation for the declining labour force participation rate. What about marginally attached workers? [No luck](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE) (edit: this rate, U6, also includes workers who work part-time for economic reasons).

The other reason why I'm not convinced by the story about a ""secret"" pool of labour hidden somewhere is that there are other reasons why the labour force participation rate is low, the biggest one being demographics. The U.S. population is getting older, and older individuals are less attached to the labour force than younger individuals. We can see whether this theory makes sense by looking at the [labour force participation rate for individuals 25 to 54 years old](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300060). It's about 2 percentage points away from its peak in the 90s, so it could grow; current civilian noninstitutional population 25 to 54 years old is [126 million](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNU00000060), so boosting the LFPR and assuming all of those workers are employed could increase employment by 2.5 million, or about 2% of the current employment level 25-54 of roughly [100 million](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS12000060). Not bad, but also not as high as some might think. The labour force participation rate of younger workers ([16-19](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300012) and [20-24](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300036)) is also low, although it's not clear how much of that is due to the recession and how much is due to the trend observed since the 1990s (probably correlated with higher college enrolment rates, although I don't have the data on hand). Finally (and despite the current wave of retiring baby boomers), the [labour force participation rate for individuals 55 years and over](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11324230) has barely been affected by the recession, so it's doubtful it could be significantly increased.

So, are labour markets currently tight? I don't think it's possible to decide with certainty one way or the other; personally, I think they are, but there are good arguments on both sides.

[Here is the thread in question](https://np.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/4smdni/why_tpp_will_mean_the_end_of_the_current_minimum/), don't ask how I came to find it because I'm not even sure at this point.

>Even the current minimum wage negatively affects many corporations' profits. Hence, under TPP, they will have a basis to sue the US for ""damages"".

If the TPP and it's ISDS provisions provided a basis for companies to sue over minimum wage, then surely the United States - already being party to some fifty agreements featuring ISDS^1 - would have been sued long before now?

The United States as a whole has had, I believe, minimum wage in some form or another since 1938, [with it increasing \(and decreasing\) multiple times since](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/History_of_US_federal_minimum_wage_increases.svg/1280px-History_of_US_federal_minimum_wage_increases.svg.png).

>The US will, of course, lose any such dispute in the kangaroo court defined via the TPP's ISDS process. Rather than pay, the anticipated default dynamic will come into play, and THE MINIMUM WAGE LAW WILL BE REPEALED, COMPLETELY, WHETHER IT'S $15/HR OR $7.25/HR.

(LOUDNESS not mine)

That (the US losing) is an assumption without *any* grounding in precedent, considering that the USA has 'never once lost an ISDS case'^2

And, to finish, I point loudly at the following paragraph from the USTR's 'TPP - Overall U.S. Benefits Fact Sheet' document:^3 

>The fully-enforceable labor standards we have won in TPP include the freedom to form unions
and bargain collectively; prohibitions against child labor and forced labor; **requirements for** acceptable conditions of work such as **minimum wage**, hours of work, and safe workplace conditions; and protections against employment discrimination. These enforceable requirements will help our workers compete fairly and reverse a status quo that disadvantages our workers through a race to the bottom on international labor standards.

# The Bad Economics of wtfhappenedin1971

Once in a while, I get asked about the website [wtfhappenedin1971.com][1] (let's call it **wtfh1971**). I first came across it when [Stephen Diehl asked me about it in our interview][2]. But apart from a r/badeconomics [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/sccs74/so_wtf_happened_in_1971/hu64fkd), the website never got the full course debunking I think it deserves. Let's fix that.

**What is this website?**

In 75 annotated charts, wtfh1971 unsubtly tries to convince you that [end of the Bretton Woods system][4] broke society. Then, of course, wtfh1971 shills bitcoin.

In 1971, you see, the US dollar stopped being convertible to gold. This is why... uh... people started divorcing more? I'm not joking, [that argument gets made:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_0977.jpg)

**An aside on the divorce rate**

Let's knock this one out of the way now: despite what people at the [mises institute][5] would have you think, not a lot of couples divorce because of bitter arguments on the convertibility of the dollar to gold.

The divorce rate increase since 1960 is related to the [no-fault divorce laws passing in the US][6] Before that, if a couple went to a court and said ""we hate each other, grant us a divorce, please"" the judge could legally say ""fuck you, you're still married, work it out"".

**Debunking wtfh1971**

Debunking Wtfh1971 is an unfair game. The website is the perfect example of the [bullshit asymmetry principle][7]. All wtfh1971 has to do is find a chart and put an arrow on it with MS paint, while I'm left explaining everything from why inequality is increasing, to how inflation works, to, apparently, the divorce rate.

Because of this, I'll separate the mistakes wtfh1971 is making into categories, and debunk those.

We've seen on here before [how a fixed money supply system like a gold standard or a bitcoin standard is a bad idea][8]. I didn't cover the obvious link to the divorce rate, but nonetheless maybe go read that because I'll try not to repeat myself too much.

# Theme 1: Productivity vs wages

The first kind of graph in wtfh1971 implies the decoupling between GDP growth and labor income happened in 1971. You see this in the first 10 graphs, [like this one:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_0540-1_arrow.jpg)

This is starting on the wrong foot. The idea that 1971 had anything to do with the productivity-wage divergence is a stretch because even [the EPI who made that graph put the divergence at 1978][9]:

[(chart)](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-9.47.36-PM.jpg)

In any case, it's worth discussing the productivity-wage divergence. *Productivity* is GDP divided by hours worked in the economy. *Wage* is the money you get in your paycheque. *Compensation* is wages + benefits (insurance, etc.).

There are several things going on at once in the wage-productivity divergence chart, so we need to unpack some labor economics.

### Compensation vs Wage

Some charts compare wage growth instead of compensation growth. Tracking wage growth over many decades [is a mistake in the USA.][10]

This is because [US Healthcare costs have grown at a ridiculous rate][11]. US Healthcare is paid through insurance. That insurance is tied to employment income because of an [idiotic tax deduction][12]. It's well known that [increases in healthcare costs are directly removed from wages][13].

So if you measure wage growth in the USA, it'll seem slow because wages are getting eaten up by health insurance.

The EPI isn't making this mistake, but other wtfh1971 [chart make this specific mistake:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-11.26.04-PM-1.jpg)

The ""relentless 50 year decline in wages"" should be labelled the ""relentless 50 year increase in healthcare costs"".

### Median vs Average Wage

Notice that **the EPI chart is plotting median compensation**. As we saw in the post on [the effect of automation on the labor market][14], wage inequality has been increasing. This means [the gap between the average wage and the median wage has been widening][15]:

[(chart here)](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-10.13.16-PM.jpg)

A leading theory says this gap started accelerating around the 1980s because of [skill-biased technological change][16]. Basically: new technology like computers is more empowering for those that are already well paid. This means well paid workers have increasing wages, while lower paid workers, especially in manual labor, have stagnant wages.

There are other trends suppressing wage growth at the bottom of the wage distribution. As noted by [Brookings:][17]

> the deteriorating value of the inflation-adjusted minimum wage, along with declining union membership, have lowered wages for many in the bottom and middle of the wage distribution.

Measuring median wage growth is indirectly measuring inequality growth, rather than actual wage growth over time.

### Nerdy measurement stuff

If you measure an economic trend over 50 years, chances are the number you're looking at is picking up all sorts of other trends along the way.

Terry Fitzgerald's paper [""where has all the income gone?""][18] shows that the divergence in household compensation growth can be explained in large part by measurement issues.

First, simply using a different measure of inflation (PCE vs CPI) will change the income growth measured by 8%.

Then, the change in household composition explains much of household income divergence. Married couples make more than singles, but there's fewer married couples since 1960. [Take this chart from Fitzgerald:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Chart5-large.jpg)

Fitzgerald explains:

> This result seems like a mathematical contradiction: How can all subgroups grow faster than the entire group? But there is no contradiction. The explanation lies in the changing household mix. Married-couple households have much higher incomes than other household types, and there has been a large decline in married-couple households. This decline depresses overall median income growth.

Uh, maybe wtfh1971 was right that the divorce rate has something to do with it?

### The gold standard has nothing to do with any of this

A lot of charts on wth1971 are based in misunderstanding the evolution of the labor market since 1980. First, remember **wage stagnation is, to some extent, real**. Mostly for the lower wage jobs. But the general date economists pick to date the start of the divergence is somewhere in the 1980s, not 1971. Let's helpfully [re-annotate the wtfh1971 charts:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-10.58.20-PM.jpg)

Stopping the conversion of the US dollar to gold didn't help invent computers or lead to exploding healthcare costs.

# Theme 2: Inflation Illiteracy

Another common one is charts just showing that wtfh1971 doesn't know what **""adjusting for inflation""** means. Here [is an example:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-11.35.11-PM.jpg)

The chart just shows that inflation is a thing that exists.

As we've seen in the post on [bitcoin/gold vs fiat money][8], low inflation isn't bad. Having stable inflation at 2% is pretty great, actually.

What's bad is deflation and especially **high volatility in inflation**. If you don't know if inflation next year will be 1% or 9%, the uncertainty will make you skeptical to finance long projects.

The 1971 switch to a floating currency permitted the period of low/stable inflation from [1980-onwards:](https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png)

Now compare this to [this plot from wtfh1971:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/10-year-bond-yield.jpg)

This **is not inflation adjusted data!** The wtfh1971 chart plots inflation rate and nothing else. Notice it tracks the 1965-2020 inflation rate from the chart above perfectly.

# Theme 3: House prices

Another common one is house prices. Take [this chart from wtfh1971:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/efkgav8wwaenvoc.png)

Apart from the fact that the trend starts in 1980 again, it's clear housing prices have diverged from wages.

Covering why house prices went crazy merits its own post, but we can agree that, like healthcare and college costs, housing prices in metropolitan areas have grown out of control. This has to do with some factors:

*   **People want to live in cities**. From 1950 to 2010, the number of US people living in [cities went from 50% to 80%:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Urban_and_rural_populations_in_the_United_States_US_Census_Bureau_1790_to_2010_OWID.svg_.png)

This means there's a lot more pressure in the housing markets of some particular metro areas. [People live in cities][19]. No one is complaining about housing prices in places people are not moving to. [Housing price growth is not evenly distributed][20]:

[(chart here)](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-13-at-8.56.29-AM.jpg)

*   **We aren't building enough houses in cities**. This is a discussion for another day, but in the cities people are moving to, we aren't building houses. This is especially due to NIMBY issues like [zoning & permitting][21]. Note that the paper I just linked is from 2002! Zoning being bad for housing prices should not be news to anyone.

Also, how taxation is implemented affects prices and construction. Repeat the holy prayer: There is no tax but the Land Value Tax, and Henry George is the last prophet. A good example of this is San Francisco, which has [been building fewer housing over time:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bay-Area-Housing-Units-Authorized_since-1967.jpg)

It should be a surprise to no one that a city which isn't building new housing units, but where people move to, the housing prices will increase.

*   **Measurement issues (again)**. As we saw, there's fewer married couples since 1960. Since people aren't living together, this means there's an increased need for *housing unit per population*. 

Also, we're not building the same houses we were in the 1970s. Much like the divorce rate affects measurement of wages, the kind of house being built affects measurement of home prices. We're building [larger houses over time, for fewer people:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/housing1.png)

One reason house prices seem so bad is that we're building bigger houses for fewer married couples. This is partly because the permitting and inspection process is much easier for a single family house than for a [5-over-1][22]. That said, the [price per square feet has been increasing nonetheless][23].

### Maybe they have a point here?

The interest rate has a large effect on the housing market.

We know housing construction is tied to the interest rate. Since construction has to be financed on a loan, there should be more construction when rates are lower. Of course that won't happen if home builders are bankrupt (see: 2008-2013) or if you're simply not allowed to build stuff (see: NYC, SF, LA, Toronto, Vancouver, etc.)

Housing price is also tied to the interest rate. People buy houses with a 25 or 30 year mortgage, and if the interest rate is lower, they can afford a more expensive house.

If the housing market was healthy, these factors might balance out. But metro areas are in a housing shortage. If you go back to my post on [bargaining power in the housing market][24], you'll remember that if there's a housing shortage, housing prices will follow the maximum price one can afford.

In that case, lowering interest rates means that for the same mortgage payment, people can afford a more expensive house. This means lower interest rates would increase housing prices, and transfer wealth from non-homeowners to homeowners.

Low interest rates increase speculative behaviour, because they let people gamble on financial outcomes over longer time horizons. A recent example is the cryptocurrency mania of 2021-2022, and how it effectively stopped when the federal [reserve increased interest rates.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-13-at-10.07.05-AM.jpg)

The housing mania in the early 2000s [was related to ""exuberant expectations""][25] - it's plausible that the low interest rates during that period accelerated housing price growth.

Now, remember that the interest rate has steadily decreased since the dollar [has become floating:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-13-at-12.16.39-AM.jpg)

It's entirely possible that over 5 decades, the interest rate going down has increased housing prices in areas with a housing shortage.

Houses are the one particular thing people finance over very long periods of time in their lives. It's not hard to conceive that low interest rates act as a long term wealth transfer from people who own the scarce thing to people who buy the scarce thing with a huge loan.

By the way: even if this were true, it wouldn't mean the solution to housing prices is to be found in messing with the interest rate. That's a bad idea. Increasing the interest rate to lower house prices would mess up all sorts of other variables in the economy (unemployment rate, inflation, etc.).

The solution to housing prices is to **build more fucking houses**.

# Theme 4: Autism causes Vaccines

The last, huge class of charts is ""numbers are generally going up"". Because lots of numbers have been going up since 1971, you can correlate anything you want if you don't do proper statistics.

A classic in the ""numbers go up so they're causing each other"" field of study is Andrew Wakefield's 1999 article that [claims the MMR vaccine causes autism][26]. Here's [the key chart in the article:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-13-at-10.20.56-AM.jpg)

Notice a few things:

1.  This is the original full resolution picture. The Lancet accepts absolute garbage quality plots, apparently.

2.  Putting arrows on charts and inferring causality is an analytic technique Andrew Wakefield and wfth1971 have in common

Again, a lot of things have been going up since 1970. Autism diagnosis, vaccination, cell phone usage, cancer diagnosis, whatever. We could also claim that [cancer diagnosis causes cell phones:][27]

[(chart here)](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cell_phones.png)

765,k0pb4d,2020-11-25,badeconomics,"I am, once again, asking libertarians to learn some ""basic economic theory""","So David Seymour, leader of the ACT Party, a libertarian party in New Zealand has said [some dumb things](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/11/labour-s-proposed-minimum-wage-increase-an-act-of-economic-vandalism-act-leader-david-seymour.html?fbclid=IwAR1hDkR4MIgFTfsthcDt2lIp84toe3D6WVGXdaAjWHhIGeAzljqxOhmGvXU) recently regarding the minimum wage. The key comments I’d like to focus on are the following: 

> Basic economic theory and empirical evidence show minimum wage increases would only serve to reduce the number of jobs available

> Seymour argues that if he's wrong - if minimum wages don't reduce the number of jobs available, and we can ""legislate our way to greater prosperity"" - left-wing groups should be advocating for a much higher minimum wage.

> ""Labour and the Helen Clark Foundation claim there's no cost to raising the minimum wage and that we can boost productivity and grow the economy by passing new laws,"" he said.

> ""If that's the case, why not advocate for a minimum wage of $50 an hour?""

Now, before we get into this, a few caveats are in order:

* I’m not claiming to know what the “right” level of minimum wage is, or suggesting that this specific increase in minimum wage cannot cause unemployment. I’d just like to explain why the “basic economic theory suggests…” argument doesn’t really work here, and explain why there’s nothing inconsistent with supporting a higher minimum wage, without taking it all the way to the extreme.
* Yes, mono means one. I am aware there is more than one employer out there. The reason why I’m choosing to use the monopsonistic case of labour markets is because it’s simpler, and even when we move onto oligopsonistic labour markets, the results are still similar. While there are some differences between each case, the key points I’d like to make are a result of firms having *some* degree of market power, rather than coming from the exact number of firms we have.

So, with that out of the way, we can crack into it. Now, if we were living in a world where labour markets were perfectly competitive, then raising the minimum wage past the equilibrium wage would unambiguously cause an increase in unemployment. However, if we consider a monopsonistic labour market, the picture is not so clear cut.

#**So, what is a monopsonistic labour market?**

Simply put, a monopsonistic labour market refers to the scenario in which there is one (after all, mono means one) firm who demands labour, and many perfect substitutes who supply it, for the prevailing wage.

#**So, how do monopsonistic labour markets differ from perfectly competitive ones?**

There are two key points I’d like to touch on here. 

*1.* First and foremost, there’s a large difference in the degree to which each agent can bargain between the two scenarios. Consider an example where I run a café, and am considering hiring an additional barista. I know that employing them will increase my revenue by $15 (which I’ll refer to as the marginal revenue product of labour, or MRPL), but I’m only offering a wage of $10 per hour. 

If there are an abundance of similar cafés around, which would experience the same increase in revenue as a result of hiring this person as I would, they would be willing to pay up to $15 per hour to hire them. So, when receiving my offer, this person’s options are (a) Accept the offer (unlikely, given there are people out there willing to pay them more for the same job), (b) Reject the offer, and go work for one of my competitors (slightly more likely, as they’re willing to pay them more for the same job), or (c) Reject the offer, and choose to sit at home instead (once again, slightly more likely than them accepting the job). If I want to hire this person, I’m going to have to pay the $15 that their labour generates for me, or somebody else will.
Now, suppose I’m the only employer in town. Suddenly, the only two options are (a) Accept the offer, or (b) Reject the offer, and choose to sit at home instead.

So the key import is this: Competition can bid the wage up to the MRPL. When there’s a lack of competition, firms still have to compete with the worker’s option of exiting the labour force, but without competing for workers with other firms, they can get away with paying slightly less than the MRPL. This mark-up they make on the MRPL (which is equal to MRPL – wage) results in profits for the firm.

*2.* Related to the last point on what competition does to the prevailing wage, in the case of perfect competition, firms act as price takers. Workers have a given MRPL, and firms must pay this amount if they want to attract workers. Therefore, when hiring an additional worker, the wage they pay them is the marginal cost of labour (which is important, as we know that firms maximise profits when MR = MC)

It’s slightly different in the case of a monopsonistic firm. Thinking back to the case of a monopoly covered in Econ 101 (which some would call basic economic theory), we saw they were price makers, in that their output decisions influenced the market price. If a monopolist was unable to engage in perfect price discrimination, selling an additional unit typically entailed them having to lower the price not just on that unit, but the ones they sold before that. Therefore, their marginal revenue is the price they sold an extra unit for, minus the revenue they lost out on when dropping the price on previous units sold. So what do we see on the flip side of that, when we have only one buyer? Pretty much the same thing. As the firm faces an upward sloping labour supply curve, when making decisions around how much labour to hire, they must account for the fact that in order to hire an additional worker, they must increase the wage they're offering to that employee, as well as the previous ones. Their marginal cost of labour is therefore the wage paid to the additional employee, plus the increase in wages now paid to other employees. As this results in a higher marginal cost of labour than in the case of a price taker, we see that the MC curve intersects the MR curve (the point at which they maximise profit, thus stop purchasing labour) much earlier than in the perfectly competitive case. In other words **firms with market power restrict their input or output, due to the impact they have on the market price.** Therefore, it’s not unreasonable to suggest that a price control which brings the price closer to the marginal cost (in a monopolies case) or marginal revenue (in a monopsonists case) may counteract this to some degree, increasing the equilibrium quantity.

#**So, what happens when we increase the minimum wage?**

To answer this question, it is perhaps easiest to draw a [graph.](https://imgur.com/2QpQIJS) We’ll let the y-axis represent the wage, and the x-axis represent the quantity of labour transacted. As mentioned before, the labour supply curve slopes upwards. After all, the firm must compete with the workers’ option to sit at home and do nothing, so in order to hire more of them, they must increase the wage. As the marginal cost of labour exceeds the wage, the marginal cost of labour curve lies above the supply curve. I don’t think it needs to be, but I’ve made the MRPL curve downward sloping. Now, the MRPL curve intersects the MCL curve at point A, so the amount of labour they wish to employ is given by L1. Looking to the point where this intersects the labour supply curve, they only need to pay a wage w1 to achieve this.

Now, what happens if we set a minimum wage, say w2? Well, it changes the marginal cost of labour. Refer to the new [graph.](https://imgur.com/sFqTZ7V) Up until point B in this new graph, a firm can hire an additional worker at the new minimum wage, while continuing to employee previous employees at the minimum wage (as it sits above the labour supply curve). So, the MCL curve is flat until it intersects the labour supply curve, at which point they must begin to pay above the minimum wage to entice new employees to work for them, where the MCL curve jumps up to where it sat prior to the increase in the minimum wage, giving us the curve MCL2. We see the new MCL curve intersects the MRPL curve at point C, so the firm will hire L2, at wage w2. In contrast with the first graph, we see that employment has actually increased, as has the prevailing wage. From the firm’s perspective, they were making some mark-up over employees’ MRPL, resulting in a profit for the firm. At the new minimum wage, *it still remains profitable to employee these people, just slightly less so*, hence they won't cut back on their hiring. The minimum wage has taken some of the firm’s profits, and distributed them to the employees.

As mentioned before, setting the price to be more closely aligned with the MRPL can counteract the effect of price-makers restricting their input decisions, and increase the total quantity in equilibrium. So, basic economic theory does not suggest that minimum wages always increase unemployment, in contrast with what David Seymour seems to believe.

#**So, why not an \*insert arbitrarily high number here\* minimum wage?**

As an example, we could look at a [graph.](https://imgur.com/Wh8kI5m) like this, where the minimum wage is set to w3, far above the MRPL for any given quantity. The resulting MCL curve is given by MCL3. Notice the as MCL > MRPL for any given L, it would cost the firm more to hire an additional worker than the revenue they would generate. As a result, any profit maximising firm would simply hire L = 0.

#**So, what have we learned?**

Well, it turns out that economic theory says that the impact of an increase in the minimum wage on employment is a little ambiguous. It depends on the degree of market power that firms have in the labour market, the MRPL, and where the equilibrium wage sits relative to the MRPL. The key to price controls not reducing output / input is that they must be closely aligned with the marginal cost / marginal revenue. So, if you’re hoping to increase incomes for people on minimum wage, it may make sense to increase the minimum wage to a certain level, but not take it to an arbitrarily high extreme.

Have you ever lay alone at thought to yourself ""What if instead of thinking critically about my beliefs I got them all from reddit?"" If so then I have the answer in the form of Men Going their Own Way or /r/MGTOW. It is truly the pinnacle of philosophical thought and discourse on reddit. As with any subreddit devoid of logically analysis it is filled was content suitable to be post on /r/badeverything but for the purposes of this R1 I will be focusing on the economics of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/584wft/priceless/), both the original .jpg and the comments thereafter. 

Let's Begin
_______________________________________________________________________

[The OP.](https://i.redd.it/boiyuou5k9sx.jpg)

This post posits the thesis ""if you want more women to be in the STEM fields, and you yourself choose to go into some different field, then you have no right to make the claim."" Firstly the logic of the post is absurd because even if that women *had* entered into the stem field it isn't as if that would have a difference in the statistics and additionally whether or not she elected to go into STEM doesn't discount her normative claim about the way the world should be. 

Even discounting the OP's poor logic the OP is still wrong because he fails to address that one of the biggest problems facing women entering the STEM fields is the significant barriers to entry. It is clear, firstly, that there is a rather sever gap in the sheer number of men vs women in STEM "" In 2011, 26 percent of STEM workers were women and 74 percent were men."" ([Page 5](https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acs-24.pdf)). Secondly while the actual causes of the STEM gap are unclear, but [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1964782) is and [here](https://www.aauw.org/files/2013/02/Why-So-Few-Women-in-Science-Technology-Engineering-and-Mathematics.pdf) are broadly theorized to be because societal expectations, lack of role models and/or lack of ability to have children, it is clear that as a society we are biasing the STEM fields towards males broadly. To pull anecdotal evidence I went to a STEM public highschool and the gender ratio was roughly 70/30 (much to my chagrin). 

Regardless, it is clear that the reason women are not in STEM fields as much as men cannot simply be hand waved away by claiming it is simple because of the individual preferences of women that they aren't represented.

[Women just aren't smart like me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/584wft/priceless/d8ydd8k/)

Now were getting into the *real* misogamy. 

Firstly let's preform some really unsophisticated analysis on the claim that women aren't smart enough. I don't see how that could remotly be true considering the IQ differences between men and women [aren't that diffrent](http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/Images/Sex%20differences%20on%20the%20WISC.jpg), the math SAT scores of men and women [aren't that different](https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/blogs/95726/2014/03/146332-148516.jpg?itok=lHtSbI-h), and even the GRE scores [aren't that fucking different
](https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/snapshot_test_taker_data_2014.pdf).

The more sophisticated response basically comes from the sources about, [I think this is the best](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1964782), but to reiterate the problem is not that women can't do the work for a stem degree the problem is with society and the way we treat women or tell them what they can or cannot do.

However, for the sake of critiquing fundamentalists on both ends of the automation debate, I decided to give a go at [*The Rise of the Machines— Why Automation is Different this Time*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKi8HfcxEk) by Kurzgesagt (spoiler: it's not).

##Part I: ""Jobs"" aren't Exogenous

>Innovation made human work easier and productivity rose, which means that more stuff or services could be produced per hour, using the same amount of human workers.

The writers for Kurzgesagt acknowledge that output equals productivity times workers. So far so good. This can be expressed mathematically as Y/N ≡ A, where Y is output and N is the population, and A is the quotient of the former, aka **productivity**.

>This also created other jobs that were better, which is important because the growing population needed work.

The question is, why wouldn't it? For sake of simplicity, let's imagine a closed economy in equilibrium.^1 The aggregate demand of this economy can be modelled as

AD = c0 + c1(Y - T) + I + G where
 
I = -c0 + (1 - c1)(Y - T) + T - G

When we substitute that in for I, we get

AD = c0 + c1(Y - T) + (-c0 + (1 - c1)(Y - T) + T - G) + G  which simplifies to

AD = Y and if we divide this by the population again we get

AD/N = Y/N

What this means is that how much work we do is proportional to how much we consume.^2,3 Population has zero impact on the availability of jobs, and this is true probably even in the short run. In other words, an even decrease in the labour supply results in a proportional decrease in labour demand. A growing population does not need to ""find"" new work.

##Part II: Cars vs Computers

>In 1979 General Motors employed more than 800 thousand workers and made about 11bln USD; in 2012, Google made about 14bln USD while employing 58 thousand people.

Well where do I even start? Firstly, the American automotive industry was already fully matured by 1979 and, with competition from Europe and Japan, was just barely no longer reaping the economic profit it once had from running an effective monopoly on auto sales in the first two and a half decades after WWII. Google in 2012 by contrast, was no where near their peak. In fact, [Alphabet now employs more than twice as many people as it did in 2012.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273744/number-of-full-time-google-employees/)

Upon verification, the claims about earnings seem to be really funky. No sources are provided for the video, but their ""Google earnings"" for 2012 seem to actually be Google's revenue for Q4 2012, and the GM numbers don't seem to come from anywhere. I don't think Kurzgesagt is lying, it's probably just compounding of a translation error with bad inflation data (and maybe exchange rates). In real terms, [1979 GM had close to 5x the revenue](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/03/business/general-motors-reports-80-loss-of-763-million.html) of [2012 Google](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/revenue).

But the more important reason I point this out is why wouldn't we expect this? Kurzgesagt acknowledges that technology has causes specialization and a higher standard of living, so why wouldn't we expect higher capital, revenue, and profit per worker? That is what meaningful growth is after all.

Comparing two specific firms across industries is obviously futile, so to really dig into this point I'm going to go for occupations. I couldn't find any particularly reputable/academic sources on this, but it seems that the UAW peaked in 1979 at around 1.5 million members, and per the UAW itself, has around 400 thousand members today. By contrast, there are about 1.6 million [Computer Programmers](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htm) and [Software Developers](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm) **alone**. So actually yes, the tech industry more than replaced the automotive industry.

>It's not enough to substitute old jobs with new ones, we need to be generating new jobs constantly because the world population is growing... but since 1973, the generation of new jobs in the US has begun to shrink.

The supposed job growth before the 90's was merely a formality. At the beginning of the 19th century [there was enough domestic labour needed for a typical household to equate to a full time job](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/03/Share-of-US-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances-with-working-hours-2-750x525.png). While the state might not consider them to be active in the labour force, the women who were doing the vast majority of that labour were carrying out an economic activity, it is work. However, [by 1970 this had been reduced to just 18 hours](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/03/Share-of-US-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances-with-working-hours-750x525.png) for a two person household because of automation- not even a part time job. In accordance with what we'd expect from neoclassical models, those women increasingly started to get commercial pay rolled jobs during their new found free time, which resulted in them showing up as part of the labour force.

##Part III: Labour isn't a Griffen Good

>A San Francisco company offers a project management software for big corporations which is supposed to eliminate middle management positions. When it's hired for a new project, the software first decides which jobs can be automated, and precisely where it needs actual professional humans. It then helps assemble a team of freelancers over the internet. The software then distributes tasks to the humans, and controls the quality of the work, tracking individual performance until the project is complete. Okay, this doesn't sound too bad. While this machine is killing one job, it creates jobs for freelancers, right? Well, as the freelancers complete their tasks, learning algorithms track them and gather data about their work and which tasks it consists of; so what's actually happening is that the freelancers are teaching a machine how to replace them.

This seems like a straightforward ""labour is an inferior good"" argument until we actually unpack what is being argued here: Essentially, this ""machine"" (technology) is lowering the cost of labour for a given output, increasing the efficiency of labour. The writers then assert without evidence that this will decrease the utilization of labour by firms. If labour is an inferior (which it isn't, but we'll get back to this) perfect substitute (which it isn't) for capital, this *might* be the case. However, since this technology is actually changing the marginal rate of technical substitution between labour and capital by making labour relatively more efficient, the cost minimizing solution for firms to maintain output would actually be to reduce their use of capital!

##Part IV: Actually, Humans are Horses (sorta)

Settle down settle down, I can already hear the people in the comments exclaiming that [labour force participation has increased](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CIVPART), that people will [readjust their skills for an automated world](https://economics.mit.edu/files/9835), and that [humans will still have comparative advantage in at least something](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/6gw9vu/the_rise_of_the_machines_why_automation_is/ditjwyk/).

All of these are true, and none of them mean that labour isn't possibly an inferior good.

It's important to understand that a few people do end up being left unemployable (or at least, far less employable) by technological advancements in a way that education simply cannot makeup for. In 1850 when most people farmed and [few knew how to read anyway](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/literate-and-illiterate-world-population), being predisposed to dyslexia did not matter. In a world where virtually all jobs require the ability to read and write, [this is now a significant barrier to occupational success for those people](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/development-and-psychopathology/article/psychosocial-correlates-of-dyslexia-across-the-life-span/17318B091DC5E96E6062C1FD3E4FB2FE) It's entirely possible (though not certain) we could see a similar impact on people predisposed to dyscalculia as we move into the 21st century and mathematical skills become very important.

As stated earlier, it is somewhat of a myth that it was atypical for women to work before the 70's, it just wasn't counted in the labour force. Men, for whom it has always been the norm to do wage/commercial labour, have had their labour force participation [substantially decline](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300001), but a significant part of that is the due to greatly expanded tertiary education participation and the increasingly large retired population. Yet, [even middle age males](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRAC25MAUSM156S) are less likely, albeit moderately, to work than in the past. What causes this? I don't know, and it's actually pretty widely debated among economists. It could be that we've become institutionally more accepting of [working age men doing that informal, unpaid work](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/06/05/growing-number-of-dads-home-with-the-kids/) that women used to dominate. It could be automation, or it could be any number of accounting and social factors that haven't been considered.

>(Despite) the US population growing by over 40 million, there was no growth at all in the number of hours worked in 15 years.

This is true, people who do work are working less, but also [as we get richer](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdppercapita-vs-annual-hours-worked?time=..). For people in developed countries, labour is an [inferior good](https://www.jstor.org/stable/135120?casa_token=2VybzKyoJkYAAAAA:SEcbS90cDL6tXh3e73xGSvzJtKIuQycASDHo7rzTP9NZ1DPmZVGgyzdkvMPtd2Uz46H7ZtYUe_l6VV9T5dETXJ5sTSIPg7ZEfyBd_AFjTPHsHzFnCcqWKw&seq=7#metadata_info_tab_contents)^(4). This doesn't mean that people want to work and can't get it, but rather that at some point, the time it takes to buy even more consumer goods just isn't worth it for people, and we're starting to hit that point in the places like the US and Europe. Further, this i a good thing as long working hours strongly associated with [bad psychosocial and health outcomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5285313/).

>*“And yet there lie in his hoards many records that few even of the lore-masters now can read, for their scripts and tongues have become dark to later men.”*

Welcome back to [*making the internet very mad at me, part 2*](https://youtu.be/DnqHONJMoww) *(née* Why Hasn’t Middle Earth Had an Industrial Revolution?) where we explore why Middle Earth should or should not have had an Industrial Revolution.^(1)

In the [last part](https://featherlessbipeds.substack.com/p/why-didnt-gandalf-own-a-colt-45), while we mainly covered natural resources, we briefly discussed how scientific knowledge was probably not *sufficient* for the Industrial Revolution. The large lag times between the discovery of relevant scientific facts (for instance, the discovery that nature allows for vacuums) and the adaptation of those facts into inventions like the steam engine suggest that more things than just science were at play.^(2) Today, I want to look slightly more in depth at scientific discovery because, while it may not have been sufficient for development, it does seem *necessary*. 

But, before we can dive into that:

**VI. We need to talk about Isengard (and also Mordor I guess)**

>***“****But I don’t want to cure cancer, I want to turn people into dinosaurs”*  
\-**Sauron**^(3)

*“But what about Mordor!”, “You clearly didn’t think about the fact that Sauron is an allegory for industrialization”, “actually, Isengard was industrializing…”* 

A lot of people seem to think that I have made a fundamental mistake and that Middle Earth actually *is* industrializing and so my question is poorly put; I don’t think this is right. 

First of all, even granting the idea that both Mordor and Isengard are industrializing, that doesn’t actually respond to the question *“Why hasn’t Middle Earth had an Industrial Revolution?”*

Fundamentally, the question is about *why* they have or have not had one instead of *if* they have or have not, but I also generally don’t think any current industrialization is that relevant. Like, imagine a divorcee who buys his ex-wife flowers on what would have been their 25th anniversary. The ex-wife is being totally reasonable when she asks *“Why didn’t you do this 15 years ago”* and we don’t think a good response is *“Well, um… actually I’m doing it now, so your question is poorly phrased.”* The point is that you didn’t do something when you should have! Similarly, the defense that some sort of Industrial Revolution is happening on Middle Earth doesn’t really explain why it didn’t before. 

A second problem is, while I will concede entirely that Tolkien clearly intended the evil locations in LOTR to *represent*the Industrial Revolution, they don’t actually seem to be industrializing.^(4) Most people who pointed this out quoted passages noting the widespread deforestation and smog being loosed into the sky.^(5) The problem with this is that these are *potential effects* of industrialization but not actually direct evidence of it. To give you another tortured metaphor, It’s a bit like seeing someone unmoving and covered in a red viscous liquid and concluding a gruesome murder happened. Like it’s possible it was a murder, but it could also be someone having a nap after a hotdog eating contest. 

Let’s start with Isengard. Sure, they are burning a bunch of trees, but that’s not actually proof of industrialization. Last week we discussed that coal was relatively cheap compared to wood in England. The reason for that was that London had deforested most of the area around it *before* the IR!^(6) For all we know, Sarumon just really hates trees. More reasonably, it might be that the trees are being used as fuel in an extensive increase of non-industrial processes.

That is, Sarumon needs to equip an incredibly large army with armor, weaponry, and all sorts of other equipment. To do that he needs fuel for furnaces and forges as well as wood for use as a material. This is pretty explicit in the text, in Isengard *“The shafts ran down by many slopes and spiral stairs to caverns far under; there Saruman had treasuries, store-houses, armouries, smithies, and great furnaces. Iron wheels revolved there endlessly, and hammers thudded.”*^(7)

Sure, at first glance this sounds *industrial,* but furnaces and forges weren’t new technologies in the industrial revolution. Here’s a list of patents for new technologies in Britain broken down by sector during the IR^(8): [https://imgur.com/a/qMRPIkg](https://imgur.com/a/qMRPIkg)

Note how the vast majority of innovations aren’t in mining or smelting (and apparently a lot of the metallurgy patents listed here were actually about plating and tinning).^(9) Furthermore, it’s not like we have textual evidence that Sarumon is actually getting *better* at producing metal stuff, just that he is producing *more* of it. For all we know, all Sarumon is doing is utilizatizing a great deal more of existing technology rather than actually creating something new. The IR was not just a change in quantity of production, it was a change in quality and kind. There doesn’t seem to be great evidence of that here.

Of course, here are a couple of hints that maybe some mechanization or technological innovation is occurring. Sarumon is described as “a mind of metal and wheels; and he does not care for growing things,” and during the march of the ents on Isengard “he set some of his precious machinery to work.”.^(10) But this is really scant evidence to say that Isengard is industrial. That “precious machinery” is described to us by hobbits unfamiliar with the area and is really just opening the furnace vents to let out heat, not exactly the most innovative thing ever. What these ornate and complicated mechanisms seem like to me is a dictator inefficiently directing the labor of the society he controls towards complicated works with existing technology, not the product of an innovative society with high technological capacity.

Similarly, Sarumon’s takeover of the Shire at the end of LOTR is not really a great example of industrialization. When the Hobbits return to the Shire, they find that the has been a coup that overthrew the prior government and instituted an autocratic kleptocracy with Sarumon at the head.^(11) The main point people make when they claim that this is industrialization is that the new government knocked down the old mill and replaced it with a larger one “full o’ wheels and outlandish contraptions” that is polluting the river. This is, I think, slightly better evidence of industrialization. 

Using water mills to provide a source of power definitely was a part of the industrial revolution.^(12) But, if you read carefully, this mill is explicitly described as still only being used to grind corn.^(13) That is, this mill is just a better version of what mills were used for in Britain since at least Roman Occupation!^(14) Perhaps it portends the oncoming harnessing of power for various mechanical purposes, but it definitely isn’t evidence of mechanical transformation itself.

As for Mordor proper, I think the evidence is even worse here. Sure, we get descriptions of lots of forges and furnaces, but, again, this isn’t industrialization.^(15) Repeat after me, it isn’t industrialization unless it involves the development of new mechanized technologies, otherwise it’s just sparkling pollution. 

So, I swear to like Eru Illuvatar or whatever, if even one of you nerds decides to write a 22 page thesis in the comments about Mordor being industrial again I will come to your house and break all of your funko pops.

**VII. Science and Culture**

>*Of their original home the Hobbits in Bilbo’s time preserved no knowledge. A love of learning (other than genealogical lore) was far from general among them, but there remained still a few in the older families who studied their own books, and even gathered reports of old times and distant lands from Elves, Dwarves, and Men.*  
**- The Red Book of Westmarch**

So, anyway, science.

When I say science was necessary for the Industrial Revolution, I really mean something like “the product of science was necessary for creation of the various technological inventions and improvements that occurred during the Industrial Revolution”. What was the product of science? To hear Joel Mokyr tell it: *useful propositional knowledge.* 

What does that mean? Essentially, facts. Scientific investigation produces clear, concrete, and (largely) correct pieces of information like “The melting point of steel is X”, “Nitrogen improves crop yields”, or “The Beatles are overrated”. Inventors in turn take these bits of knowledge and can combine and innovate with them to produce technology.^(16) To return to a frequent example, the facts surrounding the properties of pressure were critical for the development of the steam engine. Without these various bits of discrete knowledge, it’s really hard, if not impossible, to make innovations. 

This is really a multi-step process that is worth breaking down into pieces: [https://imgur.com/a/PZJbWXt](https://imgur.com/a/PZJbWXt)

Here’s an example of how this process might go. Let’s say I’m a research scientist and I discover after rigorous empirical testing that, as a matter of physics, Tolkien fans are magnetically repulsive to members of their romantically preferred gender. I take my results and write them up in a journal article using standardized notation and practices for communicating facts. That journal article is then read by someone else who uses this previously unknown fact to create the world's first human-driven electromagnetic generator, singlehandedly solving the energy crisis and stopping climate change in its tracks. Each of those steps from discovery to the encoding of the fact being read by the inventor is necessary for a new invention to be made.

The Mokyrian explanation for the Industrial Revolution is, basically, that in the immediate run up to the time period, each step in this process became easier and occurred more, creating a much larger knowledge base than would have been present otherwise and allowing for new inventions and innovations to flourish.^(17)

What caused this change? The Enlightenment. 

More specifically: the Baconian program. Mokyr has spent a large part of his career documenting how, immediately prior to the enlightenment, there was a fundamental shift away from the neo-Aristotelian Thomist synthesis of the Medieval system towards a new empiricist approach to physics and science.^(18) 

The “Baconian Program” termed after Lord Francis Bacon, was, simplifying a bit, a (partially uncoordinated) attempt to generate a large body of general principles based on empirical regularities.^(19) For instance, Newtonian mechanics may be thought of as one of the largest contributions of “the program” in as far as it was a proposed set of regularities based on the observed instances of apples falling off of trees or whatever. This resulted in a much larger body of useful knowledge to draw on for invention.

It wasn’t just that there were more facts, they were also more accessible. There was an increased willingness to make research public and to do so in a regular manner (by standardizing things like notation and measurements).^(20) Furthermore, there was an attempt to increase distribution of these facts through the regular publications of scientific journals as well as large anthologies of scientific information (most famously Diderot and D’Alembert’s *Encyclopédie).*^(21) The result of this was that scientific knowledge was more available than ever.

Of course, this just seems like we’ve punted our explanation of the industrial revolution back one step. If enlightenment scientific advancement caused industrialization, what caused the enlightenment? Continuing with Mokyr’s explanation, the answer is culture.^(22) Specifically, the driver of this change in approach towards understanding the world was a newfound belief (among elites) that economic and technological change was both possible and desirable. 

This attitude drove increased amounts of attention and resources to scientific progress (directly as more people wanted to engage with science and indirectly as status rewards incentivized scientific discovery and patronage of scientists). 

So, to spell out the process being proposed here entirely, it goes:

**Culture** → **Science** → **Invention** → **Economic Growth**

We have pretty decent qualitative evidence of a cultural shift towards science. We also have excellent evidence of an increase in scientific discovery. We can even see the increase in science quantitatively.^(23)

There was an increase in scientific journals:

[https://imgur.com/a/pn7LQZw](https://imgur.com/a/pn7LQZw)

[https://imgur.com/a/4GfQ2Yd](https://imgur.com/a/4GfQ2Yd)

As well as scientific societies:

[https://imgur.com/a/FRJzBZh](https://imgur.com/a/FRJzBZh)

So there’s at least some evidence that Culture → Science. 

What about Science → Innovation? Here, I think the evidence is more mixed. 

To remind you what the causal mechanism is that was being proposed, it’s that scientific elites discover new knowledge which then trickles down to artisans and fabricants who then use that knowledge combined with their skill to create new inventions. So, first of all, we need evidence that artisans could actually access the new science that was being created.

Van Zaden (2009) provides us some evidence of this by looking at books over time Europe and finding that they became cheaper and more available.^(24)

[https://imgur.com/a/cxwsv6Z](https://imgur.com/a/cxwsv6Z)

[https://imgur.com/a/PTuF2kp](https://imgur.com/a/PTuF2kp)

Books were more accessible *and* more people were capable of reading them:

[https://imgur.com/a/XAXX9Eq](https://imgur.com/a/XAXX9Eq)

So that’s pretty good evidence that scientific knowledge would have been more available than ever. What’s the issue?

A couple of things. First, the Enlightenment was a European wide phenomena, but industrialization began specifically in England. If it was a large driver, then why didn’t other countries take off at the same time?^(25) I don’t think this is too big a worry for us specifically, as we are only thinking of science as a necessary condition rather than the sole driver, so we can allow that Britain had unique factors that drove early industrialization.

The second problem is that the evidence that inventors of new technology during the IR actually used scientific knowledge is simply mixed. That is, even if scientific knowledge was available, it may not have been used frequently during invention. Instead, some research suggests that innovation was a more isolated phenomenon generated mainly by ‘tinkering’ or trial and error until a successful device emerged rather than being constructed in accordance with predictions made by science. For instance, “Less than one-fourth of those had any schooling other than an apprenticeship”.^(26) It’s simply hard to see how to square the low rates of education with the idea of science as a driver.

But, of course, not having a formal education is not quite the same thing as not having access to science. Where does that leave us? I think, basically, we are in a similar spot to the Factor Price theory, where there is credible evidence both for and against, but the immense plausibility of the theory demands we at least treat it seriously.

**VIII. Do Elves go to School?**

>*It is told that in their beginning the Dwarves were made by Aulë in the darkness of Middle-earth; for so greatly did Aulë desire the coming of the Children, to have learners to whom he could teach his lore and his crafts, that he was unwilling to await the fulfilment of the designs of Ilúvatar.*  
**-The Silmarillion**

So, how does this story of Culture -> Science -> Invention -> Economic Growth fit in with Middle Earth?

Frankly, Middle Earth’s level of scientific innovation is abysmal. There are a few groups mentioned in the books (which again, I have not read) that we could think of as dealing with the sorts of academic inquiry we are interested in: the archives of Minas Tirith, the elven school of Lambengolmor*,* and, of course, the council of five Wizards. These all turn out to be incredibly backwards institutions with little interest in discovery or exploration of natural science.

Let’s start with the Archives. We are told that the collection in Minas Tirith has a vast collection of “hoarded scrolls and books.” and that at least a fair amount of staff are employed in maintaining and interpreting the collection. Indeed, when Gandalf is seeking knowledge about the one ring this is the first place he seeks out, suggesting it is a location of at least decent renown. But this is also a fundamentally backwards institution, in the words of Denethor *“If indeed you look only, as you say, for records of ancient days, and the beginnings of the City, read on!’*’ he said. *‘‘For to me what was is less dark than what is to come, and that is my care.”*. This suggests that the archives primarily serve as a repository for the wisdom of the ancients rather than as an active research institution dedicated to furthering current knowledge. And the archives are even bad at their job of maintaining existing facts! Gandalf tells us that *“And yet there lie in his hoards many records that few even of the lore-masters now can read, for their scripts and tongues have become dark to later men.”* The most extreme example of this is that a scroll that tells you how to identify the one ring, basically the Middle Earth equivalent of detailed instruction on how to build a nuclear bomb, has just been sitting around unread by anyone in the basement for centuries! This is not the sort of place we should expect productive science from.

What about the Elves? The best reference I could find to any sort of organization dedicated to knowledge gathering is yet another backwards looking collection of loremasters. The school of Lambengolmor, which is primarily composed of linguists and historians, seems to be the clearest example of an Elven institution dedicated to discovery of facts or wisdom. Notably absent is any sense of forward looking discovery, with instead a focus on compiling facts about what happened.

And so we come to the Order of the Wizards. For those who (like me) have not read the books you need to understand that while wizards in Middle Earth may appear to be a friendly collection of doddering old wise men, they are, in fact, an elite strike force of angels sent by lesser gods to prepare Middle Earth for war with Sauron.

As such, I’m not too surprised that we don’t get any direct evidence that they themselves are engaging in scientific research, but it is somewhat surprising that they don’t seem to even encourage it? After all, surely with the heavy emphasis on how Sauron is tooling up Mordor for war it would have been helpful to, say, spend some of the last 1000 years helping the Free Kingdoms learn how to make better steel or something? Alas, the Wizards seem to have a fairly anti-inquiry bent with Gandalf notably telling a (fallen) Sarumon that *“he that breaks a thing* ***to find out what it is*** *has left the path of wisdom.”.* This is in reference to Sarumon making a discovery about optics that white light can be split into multiple colors. Your basic platitudes are standing in the way of the invention of glasses, Gandalf! So, no scientific discovery or encouragement is coming from here.

I think these bits of evidence combine to paint a picture of a society that is fairly backwards looking with a culture that emphasizes holding on to the teachings of the ancients over new discovery. So, the low level of discovery seems to make sense given the cultural values of the Middle Earth. 

But, when interrogating the world building, I think we can go one step deeper and ask if this sort of backwards looking culture makes sense.

To do this we need a model of culture change. 

To start with, let’s think of society as consisting of a complex network of nodes.^(27)

[https://imgur.com/a/ljQNCeJ](https://imgur.com/a/ljQNCeJ)

Where each node represents a person and each line is a social connection between those people. Now let’s assume that each person has a set of beliefs, values, and preferences that we can group under the general banner of culture. 

For any given cultural item that someone has, we think there is a chance that they transmit it to someone else. So, in our model, if Frodo comes up with a new cultural idea, say “We should form a group in charge of geothermal-powered jewelry recycling.” then there is a chance that people exposed to the new belief (i.e. connected to Frodo) will choose to adopt it. If they do, the process repeats for those people’s connections and so on. 

There are a few factors that we might think make it more or less likely for beliefs to be spread. First, it’s not like all cultural properties are equally likely to be adopted. Think about it in real life, just because you tangentially know somebody who thinks that the Pentagon is actually just a really low polygon flying saucer doesn’t mean you are going to start thinking that. Various things bias upwards or downwards the probability of a cultural norm being adopted. For instance, for beliefs that clearly do not comport with observed facts we might expect some resistance to adoption. 

The second thing that might determine culture spread and change is the size and density of the societal network. Ideas can be adopted in two ways. First, they can be picked up from someone in the network. Second, someone within the network can be a *cultural innovator* who sua sponte comes up with something new. The more people you have in the network, the more likely you are to see the introduction of new ideas. Similarly, connecting previously unconnected networks allows for access to previously unavailable ideas. Furthermore, we should pay attention to the *density* of the network. That is, for any given node how many others is it connected to. This density of connection allows for much faster spread and prevents novel ideas from getting “gated” where all of the connections to the novel idea connect it and it therefore never gets a chance to spread. 

As an example here, the development of the printing press and national mailing systems in Europe allowed for the emergence of much larger and denser social networks among the elites in Europe. This allowed for the formation of what is termed *The Republic of Letters,* a social network for scientifically and philosophically inclined elites who were able to distribute ideas and discoveries amongst each other at a much more rapid rate than they would have been able to otherwise.^(28) 

So, to return to Middle Earth, the questions we should be asking are: Were there reasons that elites in Middle Earth should be biased against adopting pro-scientific cultural attitudes, how large were the social networks amongst elites, and how dense were the social networks among the elites. 

Let’s start with the latter two questions about density and size of the network. In essence, this is asking us to investigate communication technology in Middle Earth. In general, it seems to me to be quite poor (with a couple of exceptions). Some of our evidence for this comes from the fact that the Palantiri, the seeing stones which essentially function as a long range communication device, are so highly valued. That they are so rare and so highly valued indicates lack of an alternative but similar technology, suggesting no magical means of communication is common. As for more traditional means of communication… it’s complicated? As far as I can tell, the Shire has essentially a totally functioning postal system. We get explicit reference to Bilbo and Frodo receiving mail on a regular basis. This is fairly in keeping with other aspects we learn about the Shire’s government like the presence of mayors and a professionalized police force.

However, this network doesn’t seem to extend even to close neighbors like Bree, as when Gandalf needs to send a letter to Frodo from the Prancing Pony his best option is to just leave it with the proprietor who in turn attempts (and fails) to hire random laborers to walk it to the Shire? This suggests an abysmal lack of communication institutions interregionally. As far as I can tell, none of the other locations we visit have anything better to offer and the Shire seems unique in this property. This suggests we are looking at a world where, relative to our world in the 18th century, information spreads much slower and the average person is exposed to fewer sources of new ideas. Thus, it seems probable cultural shifts would occur at a much slower rate.

As to the third question about cultural spread, whether we think the residents of Middle Earth have reasons that make them more or less likely to adopt cultural attitudes that inculcate scientific discovery, I think this can go both ways. 

u/Username42 on reddit responded to my post last week and basically predicated the case in favor of a negative bias that I was going to make (and as I am lazy I am more than happy for others to do my work for me):

*This kind of cultural change would be much less likely in Middle-Earth than in our world because most of the great disasters in the history of Arda come from innovation going wrong. The unleashing of the Balrog and destruction of Khazad-Dum came from the dwarves pushing their mining and industrialisation efforts too far. The Numenoreans were highly militarised and are hinted to have more advanced technology than anywhere in the Third Age, and their ambition got them all drowned by the Valar. Celebrimbor developed new technology for Rings of Power but Sauron was able to exploit them and gain power over their bearers. Back in the First Age, Feanor's development of the Silmarils led to the Kinslaying and the War of the Jewels, and you could even argue that the introduction of sin into the world into the Ainulindale was Melkor attempting to innovate beyond the these presented by Illuvatar.*

*If you're an elite scholar in Middle-Earth, you're raised on stories of everyone who tries to develop anything radically new getting punished for their hubris, and even though it's thousands of years ago, there are many people in the world like Elrond and Galadriel who were literally alive at the time those events happened. It's not an environment that's conducive to someone like Francis Bacon becoming a cultural icon as he did in the European Enlightenment.*

I have a couple of quibbles here and there about the specifics (not sure the Dwarves specifically were increasing in technological capability and it leaves out that the main reason for the sinking of Numenor was the attempted invasion of Valinor) but I think the thrust of this proposition is right. We would expect the deep study of past failures resulting from attempts at development to create a deep resistance to technical progress among the elite. 

So, it would seem that Tolkien has defeated me once again. Perhaps Middle Earth is, in fact, internally consistent and these are, in fact, genre defining books worthy of praise rather than overpriced doorstops whose greatest contribution to literature was laying the groundwork for the literary genius that was *I'm a Behemoth, an S-Ranked Monster, but Mistaken for a Cat, I Live as an Elf Girl's Pet***.**^(29) 

I think this thesis overlooks a key element in favor of Middle Earth being pro science. Fundamentally, to think that Middle Earth should have a culture of stagnation, you have to accept that multiple lesser gods are just fundamentally, absolutely and irrevocably terrible at their jobs. 

Let’s back up. For those who aren’t in the loop on the finer details of Ardaian Theology, in the beginning there was Eru Illuvatar. Eru wanted there to be more than just Eru, so they made a bunch of disembodied spirits who were really good at singing to sing a planet into existence. Melkor, one of these spirits (and basically the Vader to Sauron’s Kylo Ren) was like *“Nah dude, you all want to sing some pansy-ass gospel music but I think we should sing some death metal*”. This led to strenuous disagreement. Long story short, big G God ends up sending a bunch of lowercase g gods known as the Valar to the physical world to help guide mortals.

Why am I regaling you with this? Because included among those lesser gods is Aule the Smith. Aule the Smith, is, surprisingly, the god of Smiths, Craftsmen, Invention etc. We are explicitly told in the text of the Silmarillion (which, again, I have not read) that *“He is a smith and a master of all crafts, and he delights in works of skill”*. And he isn’t just invested in old or traditional ways of crafting. The text (allegedly) tells us that he *“desired to make things of \[his\] own that should be new and unthought of by others, and delighted in the praise of \[his\] skill.”*

And apparently Aule is very invested in imparting his ideology! We learn that *“Of him comes the lore and knowledge of the Earth and of all things that it contains: whether the lore of those that make not, but seek only for the understanding of what is, or the lore of all craftsmen: the weaver, the shaper of wood, and the worker in metals”* This sure sounds like a god who might want to stick his thumb on the scale in favor of science to me! Aule is actually so on board with teaching people how to make cool stuff that he skips the queue and makes sentient life thousands of years ahead of when it was supposed to emerge on earth: *“It is told that in their beginning the Dwarves were made by Aulë in the darkness of Middle-earth; for so greatly did Aulë desire the coming of the Children, to have learners to whom he could teach his lore and his crafts, that he was unwilling to await the fulfilment of the designs of Ilúvatar.”*

So, this is where, after approximately 9,000 words of exposition, I can finally hit Tolkien with a couple of barbs. Because exactly what has Aule, a literal deity who wants people to learn craftsmanship and facts, been doing for the last 35,000 years?^(30) Clearly nothing useful given the abysmal state of Middle Earth. This, I think, is the fundamental flaw in the causal chain. We know explicitly that the Valar are deities with a positive interest in the flourishing of… humankind? Elfkind? Peoplekind? The group of sentient people that populate Middle Earth. Why are they doing nothing to kick Middle Earth out of this negative equilibrium of stagnation? Given that their benevolence is basically stipulated, I think the only option left is to assume incompetence. As surely this is not what Tolkien intended, I deem him a failure whose greatest legacy is the existence of *ElfQuest*.

**Conclusion to Part II:**

So, if you buy science as a necessary condition of industrialization, then I think you are stuck in a bind between thinking Middle Earth is internally consistent and thinking that it’s gods are like, good at their jobs. This maybe isn’t the biggest worry ever however. I mean look at Gandalf, he’s an angelic emmissary of one of the gods and his best plan for saving the world involves 2 hobbits going on the worlds longest and least supervised field trip. 

Having now covered resources, factor prices, and science but somehow my determination to engage in what is, if we are honest, a fundamentally pointless excercise is holding on by a thread. So join us next time where we ask: should Gondor expect a Spanish Inquisition?

""The industrial revolution itself shows why the lump of labor fallacy is wrong.

Before the invention of the steam engine, more than 95% of humans were employed on farms, whereas today this number is around 2%. The remaining 93% of the population didn't disappear or go out of a job. Instead, automating farm work freed up the labor force to be put to more productive use over time. Some young laborers went to school instead of working on the family farm, while others started working in factories. Over time, the labor force reallocated away from agriculture and into manufacturing and services.

Similarly, as tasks are automated in the modern economy (such as manufacturing tasks) workers will shift their time into other tasks like the growing service economy.""

Let's break this down. 

""Before the invention of the steam engine, more than 95% of humans were employed on farms, whereas today this number is around 2%.""

Okay, let's take this figure of 95% at face value.

> The remaining 93% of the population didn't disappear or go out of a job.

Didn't they? What percentage of human are employed at all today? Let's look shall we?

From [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.IN) we can see that global labour force consisted on 3.474 billion people in 2019 and from [here](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/#table-historical) we can see that the global population was 7.713 billion people. This gives a value of 45% for the percentage of humans employed today.

So, the author of the automation FAQ on /r/economics would have readers believe that the percentage of humans employed has dropped from over 95% to 45% today without any workers going out of jobs. Also, the notion that nobody lost jobs is a straight up lie as children were removed from the workforce with compulsory education.",MarcusOrlyius,t2_6fsdj,0.37,0,93

Where is he getting his numbers? He links two studies, one is [centers for medicare and medicaid services study on projected cost increases](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsProjected), which does not include any of the 10 year numbers he uses.  The other study is from the Lancet discusses cost savings to the country, and not the cost to the government.

These numbers do not take into account the uninsured (""Uninsured spending on healthcare cannot be estimated or projected due to data limitations"").  They also count sources of revenue for government programs that wouldn't exist under M4A, such as $4.8 trillion for current Medicare out of pocket payments, and $2 trillion for Charity Funding.  It seems pretty clear that this oversimplified math does not take into account even close to the full costs compared to the status quo.

&nbsp;
### Employer payroll taxes

While I see no indication that these numbers are inaccurate, they are at least somewhat misleading, as [economic consensus](https://web.archive.org/web/20100713154141/http://www.americanbenefitscouncil.org/documents/bush_taxbenefits_1pager.pdf) generally accepts that the overwhelming majority of payroll taxes end up being borne by employees, not employers.  So while this will likely raise the expected revenue, they will do so on the backs of workers, not corporations.

&nbsp;
### Health tax expenditures

Sanders plans to raise 3 trillion by ""Eliminating health tax expenditures, which would no longer be needed under Medicare for All.""  I'm not clear what he means by this, but under the assumption that he's using the same definition as everyone else, he seems to be saying that we'll be able to generate additional revenue by ending the tax exemption for health insurance premiums.  Considering he'd also essentially be ending insurance premiums, I'm not sure where this 3 trillion in taxes is coming from.

&nbsp;
###  Preferential rate on capital gains

His plan to end and increase the preferential rate on capital gains is estimated around 2.5 trillion, almost two orders of magnitude higher than the $60 billion estimate of the revenue maximum from [this paper from upenn](https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2019/11/21/policy-options-increase-tax-rates-on-capital-gains-amp-dividends).

&nbsp;
### Repealing Trump tax cuts

He also claims 3 trillion by increasing top federal corporate income tax rate to 35 percent (repealing the Tax Cut and Jobs Act).  The studies I can find on this from [the JCT](https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=5055) and [tax foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/final-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-details-analysis/) show that the actual cost to the government over 10 years to be between $448 billion and $1.071 trillion (or $1.47 trillion with static scoring), far less than his claimed revenues.

This is not even getting started on [how bad economists consider corporate taxes to be](http://www.nber.org/data-appendix/w19757/CorporateTaxPaper.pdf).

&nbsp;
### Financial Transaction tax

Sanders estimates revenues of $2.4 trillion from a financial transaction tax.  The CBO [scored a smilier plan](https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/2018/54823) and found that it raises significantly less revenue than Sanders estimates, which is in line with historical results, [such as the one attempted by Sweeden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_financial_transaction_tax).

&nbsp;
### Wealth tax

Sanders estimates receipts of $4.35 trillion, far less than the [$2.6 trillion estimated by the tax foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/wealth-tax/). These taxes are generally difficult to enforce and have some serious externalities, which is why [Europe largely abandoned them](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/02/26/698057356/if-a-wealth-tax-is-such-a-good-idea-why-did-europe-kill-theirs).

Let me first set up how geographic monopolies of private defense will arise in Libertopia.

Consider Firms A and B. They are both private defense agencies. They compete with each other in some geographic area (say, Freedomopolis) for customers. They have two choices: they can either attempt to price discriminate and charge monopoly prices, or compete with each other. Firms A and B essentially have each half of the city to themselves, spread out over the entire area.

Given the oddities of demand, they can essentially split the city in half and price discriminate on both sides, or they can continue to compete and neither have a large section of the city to themselves. However, if one attempts to split the city in half and the other competes, the company attempting to split the city in half gets nothing.[ The payoff matrix looks like this.](http://i.imgur.com/Gr1SPYY.png) I've done the best responses for you, and they're circled.

We have two equilibria. We have the ""AnCap"" equilibria and the ""PDAs are states"" equilibria. Implicitly, AnCaps think that we will be at (Compete, Compete) forever.

This doesn't make a ton of sense to me. Why should we be at that equilibrium? It would behoove PDAs to simply split up Freedomopolis. There is no agency that can stop them from colluding. But once these PDAs have split up the city, why are they not simply states by another name?

So then we have this claim as to why this monopolization won't happen.

>They have a choice in choosing another provider.

Okay, so now we have a new entrant question. [Consider this game tree.]( http://i.imgur.com/a8bYl9C.png)

This implicitly covers the objections such as:

>It means the company has to survive potenitally massive losses for up to several years before any conceivable profit could occur

We can see from the game tree that the Entrant would not enter the market, because the Entrant knows that Firm A will fight upon entry. Firm A, upon fighting, will win because of its superior size. However, it will take a loss, and thus doesn't maintain the original payoff of 3. But, the Entrant loses out big time - the Entrant dies after Firm A drops a JDAM on their HQ on the corner of Rothbard and Block in Freedomopolis. Thus the mere threat of fighting - which Entrant knows will happen - stops Entrant from entering the market. Thus, customers no longer have any outside options.

From here on out, I'll just use some more verbal argumentation.

>Violence is expensive, plus then their customers/shareholders find out they're violently attacking their competitors and they lose business, or the CEO gets fired and they stop attacking people.

Alternatively, waging war is profitable in the long-run. Investors who want a payout for establishing a government might loan money to this company. There is also no reason to believe a priori that these companies will be publicly traded on some stock exchange. Lastly, customer's need not have a choice - threat of violence can be enough to keep people stuck in their contracts.

Furthermore, if violence is expensive, this should mean that any PDA that wants a customer to stay a customer can threaten a rival PDA with violence to stop them from poaching customers. It is odd to assume that violence is expensive, thus PDAs will cooperate - instead, since violence is expensive, this will solidify control over customers as PDAs want to avoid conflict and thus carve out certain customer bases for themselves (going back to my PD/PD solution).

>If companies care about long-term profits then they should also be concerned about making sure their customers are happy and healthy and the environment in which they operate is sustained.

This is not true at all. A PDA that acts as a monopolist is no different than a state. States routinely create extractive institutions (yeah, borrowing from Acemoglu and Robinson, sorry) that do very little for citizens ruled by the state. A prime example would be the Soviet Union.

As soon as a PDA becomes a monopolist, any libertarian argument against the state applies to the PDA. But apparently if we call the PDA a ""business"" we can throw all libertarian critiques of the state out the window.

>It means the company has to survive potenitally massive losses for up to several years before any conceivable profit could occur, and virtually every other security company and customer of the company would know it.

So what if there are years of massive losses? So long as the company will be the victor over the long run, short-run costs now make up for the long-run benefits. Think of these losses as simply going into debt for short time.

I wanted to take a closer look at his healthcare policy.

I'm not a healthcare economist or even a real economist (I'm a filthy (((banker)))/finance guy) but I do enjoy shitposting, so here goes. His full plan can be found here: https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/healthcare-reform

>Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to.

In terms of lowering healthcare costs, it seems to me that repealing the individual mandate would increase costs across the board. Assuming that insurance companies are still required to cover those with pre-existing conditions, the people who aren't participating in healthcare markets would primarily fall into two categories: 1) the very healthy/young, who don't need healthcare and 2) those who can't afford it altogether (especially without the tax credits).

With the first group not participating, you're basically maintaining the total costs of the insurance pool (numerator) while shrinking the people participating in the pool (denominator). If you're spreading the same costs among fewer people, premiums would have to increase for the people who actually need/use insurance. Both groups of people will still need healthcare services, but likely won't have any way to pay for them when they need them. When the healthy 25 year old barista gets hit by a car, the costs emergency room visit will fall to the taxpayer through charity care or bankruptcy. There is a similar argument for health insurance as there is for car insurance, and health care costs can rack up just as quickly.

Without the inclusion of people with preexisting conditions by law, insurers will choose to not insurance individuals who will cost them money, and these people will either have to a) fall out of the insurance market, and be a burden to the taxpayers as they required medical services they are unable to pay for, or b) come into a government insurance scheme, where they are paid for by the taxpayers.

>Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up.

This sounds great in theory – if you let everyone compete across state lines, each state will have more competition and drive prices down. In reality, while it might reduce the variance in plans across states I would imagine costs are staying the same, you might have some overhead savings, but doubtful there would be enough to move the needle since most insurance companies have de facto overhead rate caps from the ACA already.

The true outcome would probably look more like another highly regulated industry that went through a similar process in 1997, banking. In 1994 the Reigle-Neal Interstate Banking Act was passed with an effective date in 1997. Since then, we've seen massive amount of consolidation in major banks to the point of creating a few superbanks supplemented by some regional banks that are a fraction of the size (http://2oqz471sa19h3vbwa53m33yj.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bank-consolidation.jpg and http://online.wsj.com/media/snl3q.gif). Is there any reason to think insurance companies wouldn’t follow suit?

>Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldn’t Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it.

This whole bullet seems to lack cohesiveness. Full deductibility of health insurance premiums doesn't do anything to make it more affordable for poor people, who are likely already not paying federal income taxes anyway.  Additionally, there are myriad expenses that businesses are allowed to deduct that individuals are not, so why call out health insurance specifically? Why can't I deduct my grocery and transportation expenses as well? 

Additionally, allowing individuals to deduct premiums is likely going to increase premiums in the long run. If someone is paying $5,000 a year in non-taxed income right now, they should also be willing to pay $6,000 a year at a 20% tax rate. Since this is going to be the freest healthcare market on earth, prices will likely adjust over time as the number of insurance companies moves closer to oligopoly.

>Allow individuals to use Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Contributions into HSAs should be tax-free and should be allowed to accumulate. These accounts would become part of the estate of the individual and could be passed on to heirs without fear of any death penalty. These plans should be particularly attractive to young people who are healthy and can afford high-deductible insurance plans. These funds can be used by any member of a family without penalty. The flexibility and security provided by HSAs will be of great benefit to all who participate.

I actually like this idea on the whole, but it does nothing to help make medical coverage more affordable for poor people. If you can barely make ends meet, you certainly can't afford to take additional money out of your paycheck to save for medical costs you aren't even sure you're going to need! 

>Require price transparency from all healthcare providers, especially doctors and healthcare organizations like clinics and hospitals. Individuals should be able to shop to find the best prices for procedures, exams or any other medical-related procedure.

This makes the incorrect assumptions that the only factor people put into healthcare decisions is price. In reality, people are likely to want to keep their current doctor for existing needs, and utilize referrals of friends and family for new needs. Since medical care is not a uniform good, people will continue to discriminate based on perceived quality as they likely already are. People have the options to use free clinics in major cities and other inexpensive options (like the nurse practitioners who operate at CVS/Walgreens) and still choose to use family physicians who cost more. 

On top of that, the insurance company is paying the majority of the cost, so price discrimination is nearly non-existent for people among providers in their coverage network. If all doctors are going to cost me $35 per office visit, I don't really care if the insurance company is paying $100 or $200 additionally. Cost sharing type plans help, but PPO plans wouldn't see this type of discrimination. Personally, if I had to get open heart surgery I would opt for a surgeon with a great reputation and top-notch training at a well-respected facility, not the bargain basement guy operating out of a converted law office. Especially since my costs are essentially fixed.

> Block-grant Medicaid to the states. Nearly every state already offers benefits beyond what is required in the current Medicaid structure. The state governments know their people best and can manage the administration of Medicaid far better without federal overhead. States will have the incentives to seek out and eliminate fraud, waste and abuse to preserve our precious resources.

Block granting won't do anything to reduce costs by itself, it just sticks the state taxpayers with the bill. If/when they run out of money then they either have to reduce services or reduce provider payments, both of which are anathema to The Best Healthcare Plan©. It is also non-responsive to changing needs, which could negatively affect areas undergoing large structural changes in their economies at a rapid pace (like, oh I dunno, states with declining employment bases like the Rust Belt). A few big factories closed in your state unexpectedly this year? Sorry, you get what you get. 

States already have tremendous flexibility to alter their Medcaid plans to meet the needs of their citizens, without the Ryan-esque threat of cuts hanging over their heads. Knowing that Ryan plans to decrease Medicaid funding by ~50% by 2023 won't push states towards providing better, cheaper care for the citizens who need it most.

> Remove barriers to entry into free markets for drug providers that offer safe, reliable and cheaper products. Congress will need the courage to step away from the special interests and do what is right for America. Though the pharmaceutical industry is in the private sector, drug companies provide a public service. Allowing consumers access to imported, safe and dependable drugs from overseas will bring more options to consumers.

This one I'm actually kind of unsure of. It's one of those things that sounds great to a layman, but I don't know enough about the economics of the generic drug market to intelligently make a conclusion. It seems that Trump's team thinks of generic imports as a panacea for lowering drug costs, but I suspect that there are reasons it has not been implemented other than lobbying that it has not been implemented.

As it stands, we pretty much have a generic drug ready the first day a patent expires in the US, so unless he is talking about scrapping patent law I'm not sure what he's getting at. Hopefully somebody who is better informed can help me out here.

779,98ubc1,2018-08-20,badeconomics,Bad Work Week Economics in BadEconomics: The “Productivity/Workweek Length Myth” Myth,"Several weeks ago our dear subreddit saw a well-received [post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/8ygkfc/existential_comics_and_the_productivityworkweek/) critiquing celebrated philosophy comic creator and Twitter socialist Existential Comic’s [claim]( https://twitter.com/existentialcoms/status/948646228614463488?lang=en) that working hours have not declined as productivity has risen. The assertion was countered by a handy [chart]( https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/AWHNONAG) from the St. Louis Fed, which as /u/VodkaHaze points out, pretty clearly shows that over the last fifty years (though admittedly, [not over the last fifteen years]( https://imgur.com/a/fdib5Xa)), the *average* work week has massively dropped. 
However, I argue that this situation is not as straightforward as it 
seems, and I present the following points: 

**Much of the decline reported in the original post took place in the first part of the last fifty years; within the last fifteen years, the work week has indeed stalled**.

**The use of the average work week is misleading: a massive increase in part time work has drawn the average down, and if we look just at full-time employees, the work week has not just flatlined, but increased significantly over the last fifty years.**

**The modest decline in the average work week coincided with a massive increase in female labor force participation, so that the *per capita* paid work week increased significantly.**

---

The first point is fairly easy to highlight. If we focus on only the last fifteen years or so in the linked St. Louis Fed data, [we can see]( https://imgur.com/a/fdib5Xa) that the average work week has not declined, on the aggregate, since 2003, when the downward trend of earlier decades stopped. In 2003/4 the average sat at around 33.7 hours/week; after a fairly substantial dip during the recession, the average returned to about 33.7 by 2012 and has more or less sat there ever since. Indeed, ignoring the effects of the recession things seem to have completely flatlined. Existential’s assertion therefore holds some water even when generously looking at just the average numbers.

In fact, a significant sociological literature has developed around this topic. Sociologist Juliet Schor, for example, has published [an entire book](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/230106) on  “the unexpected decline of leisure”, where she finds that work times have significantly *increased* for full-time workers. Importantly, this book was published in 1993, studying the period during which according to our FRED graph, *work week length was declining the fastest*. Instead, Dr. Schor found that in the previous twenty years, the work year had actually *increased* by **nearly a month**. This study took into account not just raw hours, but also items like vacation and sick time taken, which are not accounted for in the FRED statistics, while looking at full time and part time work separately (something I discuss in the next section). This is on top of other trends, like [rising commute times]( https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2017/12/20/yes-your-commute-really-is-getting-longer/), which have further decreased leisure time for Americans. 

Secondly, using the raw average, as /u/VodkaHaze did, is somewhat misleading. Over the period the FRED data covers, we have also seen a [massive increase](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/part-time-employment)^1 in part-time employment. This issue has been discussed by [other scholars]( https://www.jstor.org/stable/25072473?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) and in the [popular press]( https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/the-rise-of-part-time-work/), and is generally well established. Importantly, this increase isn’t just a result of full-time workers transitioning into part-time work. Rather, the exploding number of part-timers were largely drawn from groups not traditionally in the labor force, for example [the elderly]( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/20/more-older-americans-are-working-and-working-more-than-they-used-to/) and most significantly, women. 

This brings me to my third point: the massive influx of women into the labor force over the period this data covers. Sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild of Berkeley cites the following numbers in her *The Commercialization of Intimate Life* (pg. 217):

>American women have gone into work in extraordinary numbers. In 1960, 28% of married women with children were working. More mother than nonmothers now work. In 1948, 11% of married women with children aged six and younger worked outside the home. In 1991, 60% did. Today over half of all mothers of children one year and younger are in the labor force.

These numbers hold up for single women as well. But Dr. Hochschild focuses on women with children for good reason: her text presents evidence that female entry into the workforce either comes at the expense of unpaid home labor needed to keep the household running and children socialized, or is now paired with it, with many women now working the sociologically infamous “second shift” where women bear the burden of most housework even as their hours of paid labor equalize with men. The point is that this is not an unused labor reserve being drawn into the workforce: we’re either giving up on doing important [social reproduction labor]( https://www.plutobooks.com/blog/social-reproduction-theory-ferguson/)^2, or taking on an additional paid shift on top of the unpaid and unmeasured work we already do. 

The bottom line is this: **Looking at the working week as one long downwards trend since the days of the infernal mills is obscuring the full story. While work hours have certainly declined since the 19th century, they have *increased* in the last fifty years, as full-time workers put in significantly more hours while sections of the population that historically did not perform wage labor enter both full and part time work. Even the average has flatlined in the last fifteen years. Existential’s tweet is therefore rooted in empirical fact.**

---

^1 My apologies for this source, BLS was down when I was writing this. Discerning readers will notice that this source lists absolute numbers rather than proportions, perhaps weakening my point. My response is that looking at these absolute numbers, we can quickly calculate that while the part-time workforce has increased some 175% since 1970, total US population has increased (according to Google) by about 60%. The part time workforce has both proportionately and absolutely increased over this time period. 

^2 This topic has its own rich history beyond the purview of this post; social thinkers at least as far back as Marx have suggested that capitalism mobilizes paid labor at the expense of unpaid but nevertheless socially essential reproductive labor (where reproduction refers not to biological reproduction, but to the social reproduction, or socialization, of persons). This proposition has led to some interesting movements over the years, for example a feminist proposal in the 1970s that housewives be paid by their husbands for their domestic work.

> It is very bad that the many libertarians can only show the tax pressure on small and medium businesses, and ignore the low tax pressure on individuals. It's clearly a very skewed sample and shows just how narrow-minded and blinded they are.

In order to show how great the tax-burden over income is in Argentina, this Argentine scientist points out that the tax revenue from income taxes as percentage of the GDP in Argentina is ""low"" compared to first world countries.

Not only is the comparison suffering from selection bias but it doesn't reflect what he wants to prove. A problem in underdeveloped countries is the large amount of off-the-books employment, which causes many salaried workers to avoid paying taxes on their income. Furthermore, even if they did, having a large percentage of the GDP coming from income taxes doesn't necessarily reflect a high or low tax-burden: it simply reflects how important tax revenue is for the country's GDP.

For reference, [Argentina has one of the highest income tax-burdens in the underdeveloped world](https://twitter.com/sebascaos/status/1330186100770541575/photo/1), higher than those of some first world countries like the USA, Canada and even Germany.

Reddit started sorting comments by a method they call ""best""^1 [a decade ago][1]. The main problem it tries to solve, according to the blog post, is that the earliest comments tend to stay at the top for any reddit post. The ""Best"" sorting method still [**fails**](https://minimaxir.com/2016/11/first-comment/) miserably at this objective (see [this chart](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/reddit-first-4-300x225.png))

Today we'll go over why and how to fix it.

*Sidenote: anyone questioning how much this is economics can refer to footnote two^2 . Moreover I'd like to remind such a person that I'm a mod here and I won't hesitate to fucking ban you if you so much as annoy me*

### There's a difference between a metric and a ranking

Lets say we have a **score** to each comment. When you open the comments on a post, they appear in a descending order of their score (best score at the top, lowest at the bottom). Evan Miller designed the ""best"" scoring method and laid out his reasoning in [this blog post][3]. He shows why naive scores are bad:

*   **Raw Score** (upvotes - downvotes) is bad because a comment with many votes might have a large score but a relatively low % of users who upvoted it. A comment with 4500 upvotes and 4000 downvotes would be scores above a comment with 400 upvotes and 0 downvotes.

*   **Average Rating** (upvotes / [upvotes + downvotes]) is bad for the opposite reason -- posts with very few votes will have either a perfect or terrible score (due low sample size and sheer luck) and the overall ranking will vary wildly. Posts with many votes will tend toward their real score, which is generally less than perfect, so they won't be at the top.

*   Reddit's **""Best""** scoring method calculates the 95% statistical lower confidence bound of the upvote/downvote ratio. Read his blog post if you want the math. Better yet, I pulled up the [actual reddit source code][4] for you to see how it's calculated.

If you want to see what the ""best"" score looks like, I plotted the output for a post with a 85% upvote ratio from [0 to 100 votes](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Capture-300x196.png)

We see that the score does converge to its true score, but it takes about 25 votes for it to get there. Below that number of votes, the comment has an artificially lower score due the best formula puinishing small sample sizes.

### Feedback Loops

Here's an observation: *A comment sorted at the top gets seen by more people*. But the converse is also true -- comments sorted at the bottom won't get seen by many readers, if any. 

Feedback loops aren't mentionned in Evan's blog post, but they were on the mind of the designers if they wanted to avoid the ""early comments stick at the top"" problem. This is still a problem. Almost all comments posted after a comment has reached critical mass in the top ranking will have a hard time getting the ~25  with their score by simply never gathering a sufficient sample size of votes to have a chance to be read by anyone. 

Here's some more sources to convince you: the paper I linked in the introduction finds on average 30% of discussion in a reddit post [is under a single top-level comment][2]. Other researchers find that manipulating the first vote on the post to be an upvote/downvote [has a large effect on final score][5]. The popular r/AmItheAsshole subreddit ran [its own little study](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cszj7a/60minute_contest_mode_is_here_to_stay_please_read/) and found that running all new posts in ""contest"" mode leads to better discussion quality.

The effect of this feedback loop is that the distribution of votes on comments follow a rough power-law distribution, even through the distribution of quality of comments clearly doesn't. This means the discussion quality on reddit is worse than it should be.

### A metric is not a ranking method

We discussed what metric to use for ranking here, but let's remind ourselves that ""descending ordering"" is just one way to rank a list of scores among many.

The best way to fix a feedback loop problem like this is by using an [exploration-exploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) framework. There are plenty of ways to do this, all of them giving new comments a chance while keeping the statistically ""best"" comments mostly at the top. [This blog](http://simplemlhacks.blogspot.com/2013/04/reddits-best-comment-scoring-algorithm.html?m=1&_sm_au_=isVNQSf0N1FVqstN) explored the topic and finds the [Thompson sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling) method performs best.


**TL;DR:** Reddit's method of ranking comments sucks. They should use some sort of exploration-exploitation method on it to make sure new comments have a chance of being at the top.

---------------------------------------------------------------

1.  I won't stop putting quotation marks around it. It's not ""the best"" scoring method and having it call itself that makes it too big for its britches and makes me want to take it down a notch.

2.  Go read MWG and come back to me -- determining how we rank things above other things is literally the mathematical basis of all of economics. It's also a subfield of game theory. Also you're banned.

A rougher pdf version of this is [available here](https://docdro.id/irYEDxB). I hope you have a Latex extension installed.

## Introduction

We will begin by giving a survey of recent work in the incel dating market problem. We then give
a brief overview of the models in question. Next we provide a model reduction in order to demonstrate that our model is at least as powerful as a previous one and we show a violation
of incel assumptions in our model. Finally we discuss problems with the model and future work.

## Previous work

There has been some previous [4] work  done on modeling dating markets under the
assumptions held in incel models which seek to show that incel models are internally inconsistent.
The goal of the MamboMentality model is to show that under their specified mechanism that the strategy 
for women is truthy, a violation of an incel assumption. Other work
[9] [8] [7]
has shown empirically that in online dating users are typically fairly truthful of their self
representations. These studies have also tended to show that there are asymmetries in what male
and female users are hoping to receive, suggesting that the payoff functions for the two groups
are different.

There has also been significant interest in recent years in adapting classic matching problems to modern dating.
There is work [6] suggesting that dating in general is not in fact stable and so
the Stable Marriage Problem has some deficiencies in modeling dating markets.
Furthermore, even in the classic SMP Huang [3] showed that a group of men or
proposers may improve their overall utility by misrepresenting their preferences and this
cheating will not decrease the utility of any other men.

## Exposition of models

### Incel model

We will assume the following properties of an incel model based on previous empirical work.
[5]

1. Women gain value only from how much utility is transferred to them
1. Women will not play the truthful strategy in any mechanism
1. Women display high levels of promiscuity
1. Women are unintelligent and selfish
1. Women hold privilege over men, they receive better outcomes

### MamboMentality model (MM)

We first give an exposition of the MM model and incel assumptions.

The MM model can be represented as a complete bipartite graph with a part of men, [;M;], and a part of 
women, [;W;], where [;|W| = 1;].
We'll denote the set of signaled values that men receive about women as [;S\_m;] and
the set of signaled values that women give of themselves as [;S\_w;], and the unknown payoff function
[;V: M \times S\_m \times S\_w \to \mathbb{R};].
[;V;] is monotonically increasing in [;S\_m;] and [;S\_w;].
Note that [;|S\_m| = |S\_w|;] as the signal each man receives about a particular woman is the same
and each woman may only send one signal about themselves to all men.
The set [;S = S\_m \cup S\_w;] is also known globally to all people in the network.
Finally we have a cost function [;b: S\_m \to \mathbb{R};] representing what a man 
must pay if they are matched with a woman given the signal received by men for that woman.
This function is also known globally.
A man [;i;] will only date a woman [;j;] if their expected payoff is higher than their cost,
[;E[V(i, S\_{m\_j}, S\_{w\_j})] > b(S\_{m\_j});].
Ultimately, a man is matched with the woman if the woman receives the highest cost from
that man.

The model seeks to show that the woman's signalling strategy is truthful which violates an incel 
assumption.
This matching problem is reduced to a problem of auctions and it is shown that the auction mechanism
is truthful, implying that an incel assumption is violated.

There are some deficiencies in this model however. Firstly, it requires that [;|W|=1;], in other
words that there is only one woman over whom all men must compete. This is likely untrue in real
life dating markets. Furthermore, it requires an integral matching over the network. In actual
dating markets it is unrealistic to restrict all men and women to only date one person. Furthermore,
by our given assumption women are promiscuous and so are unlikely to take a single partner though
this assumption was not made in the original MM model.

### Stable Fractional Matching Problem (SFMP) model

We give a refinement of the MM model by showing a reduction to stable fractional matchings as given
by Caragiannis et al in 2019. [1]

We expand upon the model by relaxing the [;|W| = 1;] condition. We further relax the condition that
the result must be an integral matching across the parts. This is done as dating is not necessarily
a one to one relation and a man may date multiple women and a woman may date multiple men. We
do not require an integral matching as people may divide their time amongst those whom they are dating.
Furthermore the relaxation from ordinal preferences in classical SMP to cardinal preferences in
SFMP also maps more closely to the MM model. Here preferences are not given in a ranking but rather
by some expected transfer of utility. Because incel models are primarily concerned with
heterosexual relationships we assume that the [;M;] and [;W;] sets are bipartite and we will assume
wlog that [;|M| = |W|;] via the standard SMP reductions. We also assume that our cardinal preference
sets are full via the standard reductions.

## MM [;\leq;] SFMP

## Violation of incel assumptions

Now we seek to show a violation of incel assumptions in our SFMP model.

It is known that the classic Gale-Shapley algorithm for solving SMP does not give a truthful mechanism
for women and as shown above a coalition of men acting non-truthfully can improve the outcomes
of some men without hurting any other men. Thus we cannot rely upon properties of SMP and
Gale-Shapley to show a violation of the truthfulness assumption.

Because [;S\_m;] is taken as given, the women's only strategy is to modify [;S\_w;]. Thus it will
be sufficient to show that one woman cheating cannot improve her outcome.

#### Theorem
> Women cheating by misrepresenting their own signals will not improve their outcomes.

#### Proof

Clearly this violates the incel assumptions: if women act selfishly and deceitfully they are worse off
and yet we assumed that women are better off than men. These assumptions cannot all
hold in the given model and so we have a contradiction.

## Discussion and future work

There are some holes in the SFMP model that may be refined with future work.

The SFMP model does not account for the fact that there is a search cost not only to discovering
the vertices in the other part of the graph but also to discovering the distribution of values
gained from signals read from these vertices. Accounting for this and optimizing a search strategy
would likely involve utilizing a model such as a multiplicative weight updated resource distribution
or a regret minimization resource distribution model. This problem may also be considered as a prior
free optimization problem in the style of Devanur, Hartline, and Yan 2018 [2].

It should be noted that SFMP is hard and relaxing the stability constraint [;y;] by an
[;\varepsilon;] factor gives a [;1 / \varepsilon;] approximation in polynomial time, which is the best
possible if [;P \neq NP;]. It is unknown if these conclusions hold in the approximation case.

We have also restricted our functions on the domain of non-negative rational numbers due to the 
definition from Caragiannis, it is unknown if these results hold on the full set of real numbers.

Brookings argues that Universal Basic Income won't solve poverty and would suck up the federal budget. Of course, UBI (in some form) is supported by a variety of figures from both the left in the right, so OP could have made a logical, well-reasoned post about how giving money away is the key to solving poverty. Instead, he accuses his opponents of being wealthy sociopaths and neoliberal shills.

>Right out the gate we start with a logical fallacy. We are not limited to these two options. These two options are being presented to us as the only two options because it is the only two options wealthy sociopaths are willing to consider. Removing subsidies for corporations, scaling back military funding, raising taxes on the wealthy, these are not mentioned, because the wealthy are not interested in even acknowledging the possibility.

[The main problem is that a UBI of only $12k/year is prohibitively expensive and would suck up 70% of the US budget.](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-06-06/universal-basic-income-is-ahead-of-its-time-to-say-the-least) Of course there are some savings, since we could eliminate social security, and move medicare to premium support, since after all the UBI was supposed to replace all other forms of social welfare. And keep in mind, this is for a UBI of only $12k/year which is less than what social security currently pays to the average retiree. A more ""reasonable"" UBI of $20k/year (and a Brazzers subscription included) would consume 116% of the national budget.

Of course I haven't addressed his point yet about cutting back other expenditures. Let's look at hypothetically implementing UBI in the country of Denmark, which is near the revenue maximizing point of the Laffer Curve. According to Bernie Sanders it's socialist utopia with all the high taxes, high spending, and low corporate welfare an American liberal could want. (Denmark actually very neoliberal but that's beside the point) [Denmark taxes 48% of GDP per year, compared to 25% in the US.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending#As_a_percentage_of_GDP) [A UBI equivalent of $20k/year per person in Denmark would consume 90% of all tax revenues.](https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm). Remember, that implementing such a UBI would involve cancelling all public pensions, social security, government health care programs, with just 10% of tax revenues left to spend on the military, schools, roads, courts, prisons and other vital government functions.

>Victim blaming, and taking a ""we know best"" approach is terrifying. They are openly insisting that they know what people need better then the people who are asking for what they need. Piling on the mentally ill, and drug addicted is adorable, given that they've done literally nothing to resolve these issues in the first place. Using it as an example for why a policy which might actually help them would actually fail them is out of touch, at best, and maliciously psychotic, which is more likely.

Now we arrive at the big question: are economists maliciously psychotic shills or just out of touch hentai-connoisseurs?

And conversely, [would offering conditional cash payments (on work, treatment etc.) promote greater welfare gains?](http://www.bmj.com/content/315/7110/703.short) 

The first study was a RCT between cocaine users and sober individuals. The first part of the experiment demonstrated that when given unconditional cash payments (the participation payment) the cocaine users performed much worse. The second part of the experiment demonstrated that when given cash incentives to perform well, the cocaine users performed better than the sober individuals. In the second study I cite, patients who were paid to comply with medical treatment were more likely to comply in 90% of the literature reviewed. Therefore, giving unconditional cash payments to the drug-addicted is probably worse than giving payments conditional on treatment.

Also the irony is definitely lost on OP after he accuses his opponents of being irrational, sociopathic shills when presented with a reasoned argument against his beliefs.

BONUS:

>I read the top response and all the others they were a big bunch of BS. And none of them addressed the essential problem that economics is going to have to solve and our current system will crash and burn if we don't solve it. That would be that according to the latest oxford study in the US alone 47% of jobs are going to be automated away over the next twenty years. That's an underestimate, because that doesn't consider knock on effects like the jobs that depend on the jobs that were automated, like cleaning out the semen of sex robots that replace prostitutes. It also doesn't include the effect of globalization either. So I would say unemployment is going to be much higher than 47% maybe even a little higher than 50% by the end of the next 20 years. The great depression happened when we had around 30% unemployment. If you would like to argue that new jobs will replace these jobs then I challenge you to tell me where these jobs will come from and how the average joe will get them. I'd also like you to keep in mind that over 90% of the jobs available today are the same jobs available 100 years ago.

Highlights:

* Predicts greater than 50% unemployment due to automation
* Declares jobs lost to automation won't be balanced out by new jobs created through efficiency gains. Worse, suggests automation will actually destroy existing jobs further down the supply chain.
* Asserts that 90% of current jobs existed in an essentially unchanged form 100 years ago.

789,fodkit,2020-03-24,badeconomics,"The cotton boycotts in Xinjiang are pointless - You can't boycott a fungible product, especially not cotton","[According to the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/western-companies-get-tangled-in-chinas-muslim-clampdown-11558017472), a major cotton mill in Xinjiang- Huafu Fashion has been using forced labor supplied by the Chinese government in Xinjiang. Huafu Fashion supplies a large number of well known brands such as Gap and Adidas with cotton and processed cotton products such as yarn.

&#x200B;

Huafu Fashion is a vertically integrated cotton company who owns a number of cotton farms and mills both inside and outside China. They supply a number of brands with raw cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton fabric. In Xinjiang, [Huafu Fashion operates a number of cotton farms](http://www.e-huafu.com/mobile/index_389.aspx) and factories producing cotton products.

&#x200B;

The press and consumers have [begun to pressure brands](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50312010) who have been implicated in doing business with Huafu Fashion, demanding that they boycott the company for using forced labor. Quickly popping over to /r/malefashionadvice shows that there exists quite a bit of outrage and that consumers believe that they should pressure their favorite brands into moving away from suppliers who have been implicated in employing forced labor.

&#x200B;

However, a closer examination of how the cotton industry operates would show that demanding your favorite brands to boycott suppliers who employ forced labor is economically pointless. Having a small handful of brands move away from a supplier due to their usage of forced labor isn't going to meaningfully impact the suppliers, nor provide serious disincentive for them to continue using forced labor.

&#x200B;

Now I’m here to discuss economics and supply chains here. I do understand that some people might find it morally appalling to personally wear clothing that contains cotton grown by companies with poor labor practices. In that case, pressuring your favorite brand to move away from suppliers implicated in labor scandals such as this one could possibly reduce the amount of cotton grown unethically in your clothing (however, even then it is highly unlikely, more on this below).

&#x200B;

Of course, I’m not in any way, shape, or form condoning forced labor. I am however, here to explain why boycotts do not noticeably harm the suppliers that use forced labor. Or in other words, I'm here to criticize slacktivism, as if writing a letter to your favorite designer is going to materially harm those benefiting from abusive labor practices and abhorrent policies.

&#x200B;

**What is a fungible good? Is cotton fungible?**

&#x200B;

A fungible good is a good that is essentially interchangeable. Every unit of this good is more or less the same as every other unit. The important thing to discuss of course, is the degree of fungibility. Cash is a perfectly fungible good, every bill or coin of the same denomination is the same. Some goods are also highly fungible, like gold or sugar. Other goods like clothing are significantly less fungible, GAP chinos and Levis jeans are not the same, and are not interchangeable. Therefore, pants are generally non-fungible. Of course, almost no good is perfectly fungible, and very few goods are perfectly non-fungible. After all, if you don’t care about appearance and only wear pants to avoid indecent exposure charges, pants are fungible to you.

&#x200B;

[The US Customs and Border Patrol defines fungible](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/nafta/guide-customs-procedures/other-instances-confer-origin/fungible-goods) as:

&#x200B;

>fungible goods are goods that are interchangeable for commercial purposes, and have essentially identical properties

&#x200B;

Because fungible products are literally interchangeable, for taxation and import reasons place there is no need to differentiate between place of origin:

&#x200B;

>When a producer mixes originating and non-originating fungible goods, so that physical identification of originating goods is impossible, the producer may determine origin of those goods based on any of the standard inventory accounting methods (e.g., FIFO, LIFO) specified in the Uniform Regulations. These provisions apply equally to fungible materials that are used in the production of a good.

&#x200B;

Here’s a good example provided by Customs and Border Patrol to illustrate:

&#x200B;

>Company Y of Mexico supplies clips to airplane manufacturers throughout North America. Some of the clips Y supplies originate in Mexico and others are made in China. All of the clips are of identical construction and are intermingled at Y's warehouse so that they are indistinguishable. On January 1, Company Y buys 3000 clips of Mexican origin; on January 3 it buys 1000 clips of Chinese origin. If Company Y elects FIFO inventory procedures, the first 3000 clips it uses to fill an order are considered Mexican, regardless of their actual origin.

&#x200B;

Or in other words, there’s a bin of clips, 3000 of which are from Mexico, 1000 of which are from China. If you go to your supplier and purchase 3000 Mexican clips, customs treats them all as Mexican clips, even if some of them are actually made in China. This is possible since the clips are fungible.

&#x200B;

Cotton is fungible. Sure, there are a variety of grades of cotton that trade at different prices, but cotton is a commodity that is publicly traded on the commodity markets, and to cotton buyers, different bales of cotton of the same grade are essentially identical.

&#x200B;

The US government’s official possible on Cotton is that it is a fungible product. And that one bale of cotton is like another. In 1955, when debating the Mutual Security Act of 1955, [it was argued that it is pointless to differentiate where cotton is from and who produced it](https://books.google.ca/books?id=wZ1OAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA231&lpg=PA231&dq=is+cotton+fungible&source=bl&ots=WHWWDHudn0&sig=ACfU3U2os-VWQBGzIM5s8jBNqfAoHZjjlg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiPyqSz-LPoAhWLZs0KHb9lAT4Q6AEwDHoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=is%20cotton%20fungible&f=false), because it is a fungible product.

&#x200B;

To take it one step further, its not like customers can differentiate between cotton from different suppliers. Cotton is very, very commonly mislabeled. The cotton industry trade group, the Better Cotton Initiative, [doesn't actually verify the physical origin of cotton](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/nov/19/egyptian-cotton-sheets-luxury-controversy-target-walmart). Instead, the cotton industry uses a “claim units” system to track cotton sourcing from different suppliers. Like clips in the example above, it doesn't matter who physically supplied the cotton, you can only advertise the cotton is from a supplier if you have the ""claim unit"" for it.

&#x200B;

Or in other words, imagine a yarn factory purchases cotton from two cotton farms, 3000 tons from supplier A and 3000 tons from supplier B. The yarn factory can treat the cotton as completely identical, store them in the same bin and everything, they have 3000 tons worth of claims from supplier A, and 3000 tons of claims from supplier B. A buyer can purchase 1500 tons of yarn made from Supplier A's cotton, and they'd get both the yarn and the claim units. The cotton in these 1500 tons don't have to physically be from supplier A, it could be from supplier B, after all, cotton is fungible.

&#x200B;

Now if a different buyer comes and says they want to purchase 4000 tons of yarn spun from supplier A's cotton, the yarn factory cannot fufill this order while complying with BCI's system, since although the yarn factory has 4500 tons of cotton left, and the cotton itself is identical, the yarn factory doesn't have enough claim units from supplier A to sell 4500 of yarn from supplier A's cotton.

&#x200B;

**Why is the Huafu Fashion boycott pointless?**

&#x200B;

As we’ve established earlier, Cotton is a fungible product. If you pressure your favorite brand to stop buying cotton from certain suppliers and switch to a different source, a different brand will buy the cotton instead.

&#x200B;

Let’s look at the state of Xinjiang's cotton industry. Xinjiang is a big producer of cotton, as it supplies around 84% of China’s cotton, and China produces around 22% of the world’s cotton. So we can calculate that Xinjiang produces a bit under a fifth of the world’s cotton.

&#x200B;

Xinjiang is home to a huge number of cotton farms. I cannot get the specific number of them in Xinjiang, but [according to the China Cotton Association](http://china-cotton.org/index/introDataList/1), there are 3400 cotton farming companies in China (a huge number of them must be in Xinjiang) and 24 million people in China farm cotton. Due to the sheer size of the overall cotton industry, forced laborers only comprise of a small percentage of the overall cotton growing workforce.

&#x200B;

When you pressure your favorite brand to boycott suppliers who have been caught using forced labor, your favorite brand might switch to a different supplier who adheres to more ethical employment standards. However, a different brand that doesn’t care will simply purchase the cotton instead, the companies that employ forced labor are fundamentally unharmed.

&#x200B;

Remember, the Xinjiang cotton market is a market with a lot of different buyers and a lot of different sellers. Supplier relationships are highly fluid, and large buyers routinely source from a number of constantly changing suppliers. This suggests to me that there exists little friction in switching between different cotton suppliers.

&#x200B;

When you write to your favorite brand, and demand that they boycott cotton from Huafu Fashion (or any other supplier implicated in a labor scandal), some other brand that doesn’t care will simply move in and purchase cotton from them instead.

&#x200B;

Remember how earlier I was talking about the claim units system? There's actually a very good chance that even if your favorite designer is refusing to purchase cotton from Huafu, their clothing still contains Huafu's physical cotton. After all, in cotton sourcing, the cotton is not physically tracked, it is the claim unit that is tracked.

&#x200B;

Imagine this scenario: you wrote to your favorite designer about boycotting Huafu. The clothing company then tells their supplier that they would no longer want fabric produced from Huafu's cotton.   However, the fabric factory is a large factory that processes cotton from a number of different cotton suppliers, one of which, is Huafu.

&#x200B;

If the fabric company doesn't physically separate the cotton from different suppliers, and just treats it as fungible, the cotton from all the different suppliers could be mixed up, and when the fabric factory sells the finished fabric to the clothing company, they could just attach claims units from a different supplier. So even though according to cotton industry tracing practices, you aren't getting Huafu's cotton, who knows really?

&#x200B;

**Edit 1: On how cotton is actually traded in Xinjiang.** 

&#x200B;

Ok, so I decided to dig into the specifics about cotton trading and look at how cotton changes hands in Xinjiang. There exists essentially two different ways of buying cotton, on exchange and off exchange. 

&#x200B;

Off exchange is pretty easy to understand: you call up the farm, you pull your truck up, hand over the money, and get the cotton. So where you get your cotton depends on which farm you source it from. Your BCI claim units come from the cotton farm itself if it is BCI certified. 

&#x200B;

On exchange, the system becomes very obfuscated. The exchange is called [the CNCE](http://www.cnce.cn/) (China National Cotton Exchange).  A cotton supplier can either hold onto the cotton in their own warehouse or ship the cotton to the exchange warehouse. 

&#x200B;

Buyers and sellers bid to determine the price of cotton on the cotton exchange. Today the market clearing price is 12450 RMB for a tonne of cotton. If you want to sell cotton, you get paid that amount per tonne, and if you want to buy cotton, you pay that amount per tonne (minus the cut the exchange gets). 

&#x200B;

But wait, what if you want BCI verified claim units of something like ""BCI verified Xinjiang cotton"" or something like that? Well remember how BCI and other cotton trading organizations treat cotton as fungible? Claim units are traded separately. 

&#x200B;

So think about it like this:

&#x200B;

A typical cotton supplier makes one kind of product: cotton. BCI certified cotton suppliers make two kinds of product, cotton and BCI claim units. 

&#x200B;

All cotton companies who decide to trade on exchange get the same market clearing price for cotton. Cotton companies who follow BCI production guidelines and get BCI claims then sell their BCI claims separately. 

&#x200B;

If you are a company that produces cotton ethically (both environmentally and labor relations), you can get BCI certified to produce BCI claims. However, only 14% of the world's cotton is BCI certified (and certification rates are much higher in areas where cotton is more mechanically produced). Certification rates in Xinjiang are much lower. 

&#x200B;

Assume at the exchange the market clearing price for cotton is $x/ton, and the price for BCI claim units are $y ton. A clothing company who doesn't care for how the cotton is produced will pay $x/ton for cotton. A clothing company who advertises that their cotton is produced ethically will pay $x+y/ton for cotton. 

&#x200B;

Similarly, a cotton farm that isn't BCI certified gets $x/ton per ton of cotton they sell. A cotton farm that is BCI certified gets $x+y/ton per ton of cotton. 

&#x200B;

Now here's the thing, [Huafu is BCI certified](http://www.e-huafu.com/pppj/index_305.aspx), but BCI certification is per cotton gin, and differs per facility. Assuming that BCI didn't just get bribed to look the other way, I'm assuming that Huafu's farms without forced labor are BCI certified, while Huafu's farms with forced labor are not. 

&#x200B;

Or to put it in mathematical terms: If Huafu produces A tons of cotton without forced labor (and BCI certified) and B tons of cotton with forced labor, assuming they sell the cotton on exchange, their revenue for cotton would be:

>(A + B)x + Ay

If Huafu used no forced labor, their total revenue will be:

>A(x+y)

&#x200B;

So as long as the exchange price of cotton is above Huafu's costs (which of course it will be, since Huafu is using forced labor, I assume it is a lot cheaper than their competitors). Forced labor will be profitable for them.

&#x200B;

**A market based solution to the forced labor issue:**

&#x200B;

A Market based solution could be possible under the current system if the demand for ethically produced cotton is so high, the value of cotton transfers to the BCI claim away from the raw cotton itself. 

&#x200B;

Again, assume cotton is $x/ton, and the price for BCI claim units are $y ton, there needs to be so much pressure on the price of cotton, that $x is below the production costs of cotton even with forced labor, and that ethical producers of cotton can turn a profit when they gain revenues of $(x+y)/ton.

Who cares, because the commenters don't.","Reddit post: https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/e1fmtm/economists_say_forgiving_student_debt_would_boost/

Original article: https://news.wgcu.org/post/economists-say-forgiving-student-debt-would-boost-economy

Headline:

> Economists Say Forgiving Student Debt Would Boost Economy

This was flaired with ""site altered headline"", since the original site headline is now slightly different:

> Forgiving Student Debt Would Boost Economy, Economists Say

The comment section of /r/politics is frothing at this news: *of course it would.  More spending money for ~~me~~ college graduates means more money spent in the economy = better economy.  Airtight.*  The comment section of the thread, sorted by top, is filled with these replies reiterating this point in many different ways, from more respectable but incomplete arguments that the transfer of wealth would be a net good, to individual anecdotes, down to the usual lopsided caricatures of reality.  Unfortunately, the article's headline is incredibly misleading.

I'm going to preface this with saying that I'm not an economist, so I'd appreciate any correction or addition to this.  I tried to avoid making strong blanket statements on certain topics, particularly the notion of home ownership and tax rates, because I don't want to open myself up for criticism on a point not relevant to the badecon taking place here.

***

The first problem with the article's headline is the ""economists"" themselves.  When I saw the headline, I thought ""interesting.  Which economists?""  Anyone with this attitude is, by now, used to disappointment; the article cites only two people.  One is [Lawrence Yun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Yun), currently the National Association of Realtors chief economist, and the other is [William Foster](https://events.moodys.io/moodys-speakers/foster-william-en), vice president of Moody's Investor Service, a credit rating agency.

Yun's talking points, at least as stated in the article, revolve entirely around how student loans affect home ownership.  Surprise: higher student loans means lower home ownership.  He also states that homeowners have a much higher net worth than renters.  *Shocking.*

The idea that owning a home builds wealth is pretty common, but observe that Yun's statements in the article don't touch anything not related to home ownership.  It's to be expected - he is representing a realtor's organization, so of course his concern is home ownership - but this needs to be kept in mind when discussing the issue of student loan forgiveness.  More important than all this, however, is the following tidbit (emphasis mine):

> **He's not endorsing any particular plan**, but he estimates that broad loan forgiveness would push up the number of home sales quite a bit.

He didn't even endorse the plans being lauded by the commenters of the article.  Who knows what statements he made about the downsides of student loan forgiveness, since the article isn't talking about them.  Yun's non-endorsement is touched on in one subordinate clause, but his points about the upsides of loan forgiveness span multiple paragraphs.  I tried googling his name and ""student loan forgiveness"" to find what his position might be on it more specifically, but all I found was the exact same article posted to at least 5 different outlets, with literally no changes between them.

Foster's points in the article about student loan forgiveness have a much larger breadth; he discusses how forgiving student loans would result in a massive boost in GDP.  He also states that forgiving student loans would let college graduates buy homes, and that owning a home is ""the most powerful way for most working and middle class people to build wealth.""

First, I want to take a moment to appreciate a large bit of irony: when I found this article on /r/all, I found it at the number 2 spot with about 18 and a half thousand upvotes.  Right above it, with over 21 thousand, was [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/e1gtlk/everything_is_not_fine_nobel_economist_calls_on/) article, with the usual sensationalist ""we need to rework the entire global economy"" comments.  Both those articles have almost doubled in upvote count since I found them, read the article, took a shower, and started typing this R1.  Go ahead and let that one sink in.  GDP is useless, until its growth is associated with something I like, in which case now it's a good thing.  I'm sure ""Reddit is not one person"" is a natural reply a lot of people have, but honestly at this point it's obvious that many Redditors latch to ideas they like first and bring the reasoning later.

Foster's first point is almost a tautology.  Of course forgiving student loans would increase GDP.  Debt payments from students don't count as an increase in GDP, but most likely whatever they would spend it on otherwise would.  GDP is not a perfect measurement (as Joseph Stiglitz, an actual Nobel economist, said in the other aforementioned article), and maximizing it without regards to whether what is being done to maximize it is not productive or useful.  Even worse is maximizing short term GDP without regards to long term GDP.  If forgiving student debt increases consumer spending now, but the taxes levied to make up the difference results in an end reduction in investment, will the GDP stay unaffected?  His second point about housing is a pretty common idea, but it's still a narrow view of the issue.  But Foster's apprehensions about student loan forgiveness aren't listed until the very end of the article, where he talks about, you know, the huge downsides to student loan forgiveness.  I'll go over this more in a bit.

The biggest takeaway anyone reading this should have is that when an article says ""experts say X"", there is a huge leeway as to who the experts are, what their focus is, and what they're actually saying.  In this case, they referred to two economists with arguably biased interests/perspectives, selectively took claims and quotes from them, and used them to imply that those people were making a point they weren't.  What should be represented as ""these two guys with some good insight believe that X plan has Y upsides but Z downsides, so be cautious"" was instead interpreted by tens of thousands of Redditors as ""pretty much all the experts agree that X is a fantastic plan and only the bad guys in the world don't want it so they can keep twirling their evil mustaches"".  I'm not an economist, so I'm not claiming that Yun or Foster are committing bad econ; I'm reserving my criticism for the article's author, its publishers, and the Reddit commenters going all in on the headline.

***

Now I want to talk more about the general idea of student loan forgiveness and its downsides.  Where should I begin?

Student loans aren't particularly special in their regards to increase GDP; almost **any** loan forgiveness is going to increase GDP, as long as the money that would otherwise be spent on those loans is spent in areas that are measured by GDP (e.g. consumer spending).  Forgiving (or buying, then forgiving) credit card debt, mortgages, car loans, loans for medical bills, business loans, or literally any other form of debt would increase GDP.  That doesn't automatically make it a good thing.  What does make student loan debt different is the sort of person who has it: college graduates make much higher income than non-graduates.  I mean, I can give you [1](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2017/high-school-graduates-who-work-full-time-had-median-weekly-earnings-of-718-in-second-quarter.htm) [2](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/) [3](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/research-summaries/education-earnings.html) sources for this, but honestly why bother.  This is common knowledge; people who graduate from college make more than those who don't.  A wealth transfer towards some of America's highest earners is not really necessary; if you're so concerned with stopping the robber barons and billionaire class from exploiting the poor, why not cancel credit card debt instead?  People choose to go into debt to go to college as opposed to working right out of high school or going to trade school, but often times people in credit card debt were in unfortunate scenarios in life where they felt they had no other option.  Cancelling car loans would probably help millions of people who rely on it to get to their job, with some of those people living paycheck to paycheck.  It's quite likely that, if you're so concerned with increasing GDP, the people who would benefit from these earn less money, and these people have a higher [marginal propensity to consume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_propensity_to_consume).  College graduates with a sudden extra amount of income are more likely to invest it.  These sorts of investments, ironically, are painted as unproductive or even exploitative in the comment section of the article.

There are a number of potential replies to this, so I'd like to touch on them:

* *There aren't big downsides to student loan forgiveness.  Creditors are wealthy already, and don't need the money; college graduates do.*

 Student loans are a source of income for the government and are an asset owned.  [There is over $1.5 trillion of federal student debt](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=SLOAS,#0); if you were to forgive this whole amount in one go, you would greatly increase the deficit.  Even if the government can print money and levy taxes, it cannot do so without consequences: you can't ignore the deficit with the reasoning that ""it's the government, so it's OK"".  Is it different?  Certainly, but that doesn't mean you can just flat out not care.  If you're thinking that we should tax the rich to pay for it or that college should be free anyway, see the points below.

* *College should be free in the first place.*

 * Education does not grow on trees - it is expensive for a reason.  Educating someone is resource intensive.  If you make something like that free, the resource becomes over-utilized.  Imagine if the government paid everyone's gas bill.  You know what would happen?  Cars would pack the roads, we'd run out of gas, and ironically, people not well off enough to afford a car gain nothing from it.  Massive forgiveness of student loans encourage more people to take out student loans, and making college free encourages everyone to go, even if they don't need to or shouldn't.  Not everyone needs to be college educated.

 * Something being paid for by the government isn't free with no asterisks - it has to be paid for somehow.  The methods of paying for it would all require, in one form or another, much higher taxes, and while those taxes can be distributed in a number of ways, there isn't a way of doing it without negative consequences.  The question becomes whether the tax combined with free college is a net good or not.

 Observe that neither of these points is a rejection of the idea that the government should subsidize education, college or otherwise.  It's just stating the fact that it is not free, and trying to reduce the cost too far will result in over-utilization.

**EDIT**: I'm way late with this, but I should say this particular bullet point was not thought out well.  There are countries that have free higher education and make it work, so my implication that free college is economically bad was mistaken.  I will leave it unedited, though, as the main point wasn't so much about tuition-free college as about what ""free"" means and the potential consequences.  I apologize for this - especially the vague claim about ""over-utilization"" - but I think the point of this section, as well as the rest of the R1, still stands.


* *The super-wealthy should be taxed to pay for universal college.*

 Progressive tax rates are a pretty common idea, but like anything it can go overboard.  The richest Americans don't store their income in giant piles of cash that sit around and collect dust; they're stored in assets and investments.  If the wealthy are taxed too much, it reduces the investment made in the economy and consequently reduces job and economic opportunities - or alternatively, it leads to them simply moving abroad.  I understand that this sounds eerily similar to ""trickle down economics"", which is not what I'm advocating - higher income brackets should certainly have higher tax rates.  But that doesn't make them an infinite pile of cash just waiting to be taxed for whatever you'd like.  Budget plans still need to be grounded in reality.

***

The biggest irony in this whole situation is that the middle class and above are the ones who have to gain from this sort of policy, and not America's poorest.  Think about the sort of person saddled with car payments or credit card debt.  Some of them, naturally, might just be people who had money but made poor decisions.  However, a lot of those people are lower class workers who need their cars to go to work, or needed to go into debt to put food on the table.  Why not buy this debt from creditors and forgive that instead?  You could argue it would result in better off people taking advantage of it, but how couldn't this argument be given to the stereotypical liberal arts major, who got a degree before thinking about how they would pay for it?  At the end of the day, it's rent seeking, plain and simple.  It's a transfer of wealth from taxpayers to a specific group that already has higher income prospects.

Many of these people might justify themselves by proclaiming that they support a UBI or universal healthcare as well, but that just adds to the question as to how on Earth they intend to pay for those on top of this program.  Do you really think everyone richer than you is just a giant bag of money that can be mined through the government with no consequence?

I'd like to go through some of the comments on the article now, to see how this headline was discussed.  It's mostly just a repetition of the above ideas, strung together.  The [top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/e1fmtm/economists_say_forgiving_student_debt_would_boost/f8ord4m/):

> The middle class having more money means they will spend more money.  The super rich having more money means they will have a bigger balance in their savings account...

Again, they don't have giant savings accounts just sitting with gold coins to swim through.  They invest them, which are converted to job opportunities or economic enterprises.  Besides, you want more spending money in the economy, lower class Americans have a higher MPS - you should favor a program that benefits them and not college graduates.  The [top reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/e1fmtm/economists_say_forgiving_student_debt_would_boost/f8osis4/) to this comment is even worse:

> It’s really worse than that if you think about it.  Middle and lower income people will recirculate the money.  Rich people use the money to buy more of our collective resources and then profit off of them. It actually makes the problem worse every time we do this. They’re not “hoarding the money,” they’re hoarding what they buy with the money, which is the means of production.

This person is trying to conflate middle and lower income earners as much as possible.  Beyond this, wasn't one of the article's biggest arguments for debt forgiveness to promote home ownership?  You know, to build wealth over time?  What was that called again?  ""We don't want the super rich investing because it's just going to lead them to steal from our labor - *we* should be the investors instead.""  And if you genuinely believe that the concept of an investment as a whole is a scam that should be done away with by way of dismantling the entire economy and basing it on one that has failed every time it's been tried, I'm afraid the refutation of this is outside of the scope of this R1.

 I do notice a trend.  You'd use the money you now have to hire people for luxury services like cleaning and lawn mowing that might otherwise be hired by someone else instead.  But it's fine, because it's *you* who gets to have the nice things.

791,f93uvx,2020-02-25,badeconomics,"Publishing null results is not a bad idea, but we shouldn't condition publishing based on outcomes in the first place","I'm responding to this comment here:

>[Publishing null results is a stupendously bad idea. In the sciences there is always an undercurrent of bad scientific thinkers pushing for it.](https://np.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/f8814a/d_null_no_result_submissions/fiju9jl/)

Thankfully the other users in the thread (e.g. [1](https://np.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/f8814a/d_null_no_result_submissions/fijxp5k/), [2](https://np.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/f8814a/d_null_no_result_submissions/fil6b5n/)) did a good job in their replies, but I wanted to throw out a different perspective using simulation. Code is in R. 

Here are the libraries you'll need, and let's set a seed for reproducibility:

    library(DesignLibrary)
    library(tidyverse)
    set.seed(02202020)

Let's use `DesignLibrary` to generate 1,000 super straight-forward RCTs: n = 100,^1 equal probabilities of assignment to treatment and control groups, a control group mean of zero and standard deviation of 1, an ATE of 0.2, and the correlation between treatment and control outcomes is 1. Can't get any simpler than this!

    design <- expand_design(two_arm_designer, 
                         ate = 0.2, N = 100)

    simulations <- simulate_design(design, sims = 1000)

It's pretty easy to estimate our parameter of interest, 0.2, even without doing any fancy meta-analysis or anything like that.^2 [This is what our full distribution of studies will look like.](https://i.imgur.com/TQJPVYQ.png) The blue line is our estimate of the parameter of interest based on the data we observe, and the black line is its true value.

    mean(simulations$estimate)

    ggplot(simulations, aes(x=estimate)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 2/30) + 
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(estimate)), color=""blue"", linetype=""dashed"", size=1) +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 0.2), color=""black"", linetype=""dashed"", size=1) +
    labs(x=""Estimates"", y = ""Count"") 

So far so good... but wait, what happens if we do not report null results? The OP was unclear about what exactly they meant by negative results, so let's take two conceptualizations. 

First, suppose we only observe (publish) statistically significant results (p-value <= 0.05). What do you think will happen to our estimates? 

Well, it turns out we cannot estimate our parameter of interest without the full distribution of studies. [Here is what splitting up our distribution looks like in this case.](https://i.imgur.com/yB7tSjl.png) The mean of our ATEs from *only* the studies with a p-value <= of 0.05 is almost 0.5, represented by the red bars and the red dashed line, far greater than the true value of 0.2, represented by the black line. As an aside, unsurprisingly, the mean of our ATEs from *only* the ""unpublished"" studies is an underestimate of ~0.13, represented by the blue bars and the blue dashed line.

    sims_sig_bias <- simulations %>% mutate(filter = if_else(p.value < 0.05, ""Publication Bias"", ""Unpublished""))

    mean(sims_sig_bias[sims_sig_bias$filter == ""Publication Bias"",]$estimate)
    mean(sims_sig_bias[sims_sig_bias$filter == ""Unpublished"",]$estimate)

    ggplot(sims_sig_bias, aes(x=estimate, color=filter, fill = filter)) +
    geom_histogram(position=""dodge"") +
    geom_vline(data=sims_sig_bias, aes(xintercept=mean(sims_sig_bias[sims_sig_bias$filter == ""Publication Bias"",]$estimate)), color = ""red"", linetype=""dashed"") + 
    geom_vline(data=sims_sig_bias, aes(xintercept=mean(sims_sig_bias[sims_sig_bias$filter == ""Unpublished"",]$estimate)), color = ""blue"", linetype=""dashed"") +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept=0.2), color = ""black"", linetype=""dashed"") +
    labs(x=""Estimates"", y = ""Count"") + 
    theme(legend.position=""none"")

Now suppose we only observe/report/publish results with estimates that are bounded away from zero regardless of their statistical significance?^3 Will that solve the problem?

[As you might imagine: no.](https://i.imgur.com/dCPJp7F.png) Using only our ""published"" studies, our estimate of the parameter of interest is ~0.24, closer—but still an overestimate. The estimate using only the ""unpublished"" studies is wrong as well, of course: here we estimate close to a zero effect.

    sims_mag_bias <- simulations %>% mutate(filter = ifelse(estimate >= 0.1, ""Magnitude Bias"", ifelse(estimate <= -0.1,""Magnitude Bias"", ""Unpublished"")))

    mean(sims_mag_bias[sims_mag_bias$filter == ""Magnitude Bias"",]$estimate)
    mean(sims_mag_bias[sims_mag_bias$filter == ""Unpublished"",]$estimate)

    ggplot(sims_mag_bias, aes(x=estimate, color=filter, fill = filter)) +
    geom_histogram(position=""dodge"") + 
    geom_vline(data=sims_mag_bias, aes(xintercept=mean(sims_mag_bias[sims_mag_bias$filter == ""Magnitude Bias"",]$estimate)), color = ""red"", linetype=""dashed"") + 
    geom_vline(data=sims_mag_bias, aes(xintercept=mean(sims_mag_bias[sims_mag_bias$filter == ""Unpublished"",]$estimate)), color = ""blue"", linetype=""dashed"") +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept=0.2), color = ""black"", linetype=""dashed"") +
    labs(x=""Estimates"", y = ""Count"") + 
    theme(legend.position=""none"")

What do we take away from this? We mostly all know that publishing *only* statistically significant results is bad, about p-hacking, about the replication crisis, etc. This is the point that I am responding to for the purposes of the RI (lots of people ignoring RIII recently!) Borrowing from [this blog post](https://declaredesign.org/blog/2019-01-08_significance_filter.html)—which inspired this post and is essentially another way to look at this same issue:

Two distinct problems arise if only significant results are published:

* The results of published studies will be biased towards larger magnitudes.
* The published studies will be unrepresentative of the distribution of true effects in the relevant population of studies.

But, as these simulations and the blog post also show, publishing *only* null results will lead to bias as well. It's best to not condition publication on results at all, so that we can observe the full distribution of studies.

Someone showed me [this tweet](https://twitter.com/ExogenyKarl/status/1400627529598353408) that links to a substack post screeching about wokeism at the Fed. [This is an astonishingly bad article](https://archive.is/wucdE). It is greatly depressing that some of my friends who do not study economics took this article seriously. 

He's complaining about the [New York Fed's current web page](https://www.newyorkfed.org/) ([archived version](https://archive.is/QFIw5)). 

Its long and rambley but this paragraph summarizes his main thesis:

>This then begs the question: what happens when such crypto-communism is allowed to creep into our once hallowed institutions? **What happens when Marxists become our central bankers? The financial system loses all credibility and crumbles**, of course. Trust and independence must be earned by meritocracy, competence, and institutional restraint; they are pissing it away for nothing, save for some warm fuzzy feelings. **Stuff like this has absolutely destroyed the credibility of other countries many times over**, and **if the U.S. stays on this path, I am not sure how the IMF can credibly advocate for monetary independence overseas**. You tell them to stop giving political handouts to political clientele, they'll just point to America and say you're doing exactly the same thing. **The end game here is that USD will fall, the empire implodes, and Chicago becomes Chengdu. China is laughing at you**.


So China is going to invade Chicago or something because the Federal Reserve Bank of New York decided to say that racism is bad. Aight. Lets get this R1 started.

He has a bunch of issues with the web page. He starts out with complaining that there's nothing about monetary policy on the page:

>Navigate to newyorkfed.org, and rather than anything relating to monetary policy, you will be met with the following [impenetrable statement](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/images/v4/home_page/featured_photo/speical-nyfed-statement-fp.jpg?h=640&w=1280&la=en) front-and-center on the landing page

But there are things related to monetary policy. You don't even need to scroll down for this. [There are 3 different monetary policy announcements right there](https://imgur.com/d683YcX). First one is about [winding down an emergency lending facility](https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/markets/2021/20210603). Second one is announcing [a specific kind of open market operation for treasuries](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_210527). Third is about an [open market operation for mortgage backed securities](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_210525). To be fair, most people do not know how monetary policy is conducted in the United States beyond ""its when the Fed buys and sells bonds"" but given the qualifications in his twitter bio I feel like he should have been able to identify these announcements as monetary policy related based on the titles alone.^1 
 
Okay I'm being snarky right now I know he probably didn't mean that literally. But this is related to another point he brings up about the Fed's mission:

> By extending their dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment to a triple mandate (“no more white males!”), the Fed has made the fatal mistake of falling for mission creep: the gradual or incremental expansion of an intervention, project or mission, beyond its original scope, focus or goals. 

Basically he thinks that the Fed making [this statement](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/images/v4/home_page/featured_photo/speical-nyfed-statement-fp.jpg?h=640&w=1280&la=en) about racism is somehow extending the Fed's original mission. But its not. Monetary policy is an important part of the Fed's mission yes. But the Fed does other things as well. It is an important financial regulator and it is also a very important *research institution*. If you do not understand how the Fed in its capacity as a research institution can help us ""understand and find solutions to the numerous forms of inequality that communities of color experience"" then just click on the link to the [""Economic Inequality"" research series](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/heterogeneity-series) that's right next to the statement he's complaining about. The Fed's relationship with banks all across the nation puts it in an ideal position to conduct research like [this for example](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2021/05/who-benefited-from-ppp-loans-by-fintech-lenders.html) which is about how well PPP loans issued by fintech lenders reached minority communities. 

The point I'm trying to make here is that this is just the New York Fed exercising academic free speech. There is a fundamental contradiction in this post. He's fearmongering about cancel culture curtailing speech when all the Fed is doing is conducting research related to racial discrimination. The Fed is uniquely capable of conducting certain kinds of research and that includes much more than monetary policy. 

Moving on. 

>Why have we allowed this mission creep to occur? The most obvious, and mostly correct answer, is that — fueled by a Democratic Whitehouse and vindictive anti-Trump backlash — the political zeitgeist demands it. 

The Economic Inequality research series actually started in October 2019 - during the Trump administration. I tried to find a primary source for the main statement that he's spending a ton of time writing about but the best I can find is [this Facebook post from June 2020](https://www.facebook.com/newyorkfed/photos/1706795382794199/). Also during the Trump administration. I could also point out that the Federal Reserve Banks are pretty independent from the president and not under Joe Biden's direct control but whatever. 

>An even simpler explanation might be that Central bankers have big egos and like to feel important; interest rates have been stuck at zero for the past decade, they are sitting in their cubicles with their thumbs up their collective asses, and so they sought out new powers out of some misguided notion of needing to feel useful.

Vulgar Keynesian/MMT nonsense. [Monetary policy remains effective at the ZLB](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/g78bho/the_single_family_homes_sticky_24_april_2020/foti6t2/). Maybe not as effective but its not like the Fed is sitting around looking for things to do. 

The article goes on to point at other pieces of evidence because I guess he was done milking this one statement for so long. I don't really care to engage this its just twitter threads by Caudia Sahm and Doleac and also some blog posts. What I do want to engage is this weird attack on Lisa Cook because its actually something of substance. The Biden administration is talking about nominating Lisa for the Board of Governors. Chris has an issue with this:

> So, who is Lisa Cook? Just a random economist at Michigan State University who has shamelessly leveraged her skin color and genitalia into gaining the backing of several key White House officials as the probable choice for President Joe Biden’s next nominee for an open seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Just how unqualified is she? Glad you asked. **Please go look at her [CV yourself](https://lisadcook.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Revised-CV-PDF-Edits-0521.pdf), which shows that based on merit she's not even qualified to be a visiting staff economist at the Fed, let alone serve on the Board of Governors**... She’s not even a macroeconomist! This isn’t her area!

Lets take a look at that CV. 

- She has a PhD from UC Berkeley. [Literally a T5 grad school](https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.econdept.html). Senior economist at the CEA and the Treasury department. Professor at MSU. That's #31 on the same rankings list. This is a ton of experience.
- Based on education alone she is already more qualified than 4 current members of the Board of Governors **including the current Fed Chair**:

| Governor | Education                                                                                                 |

| Clarida   | Econ Phd from Harvard.                                                                                     |

- She has published more papers than I care to count right now. 
- Chris claims she's not a macro-economist. Her research does seem mostly focused on discrimination and cliometrics. But I can identify at least 5 papers here about fiscal policy during recessions, finance, and more specifically financial crises. Does finance count as macro? I mean sometimes yea I'd say so. But even if its not macro, its certainly relevant research for the Federal Reserve. Financial regulation also matters. 
- Eichengreen was her Phd advisor and he's based as fuck. 

I spent like 3 hours writing this thing and I feel gross for engaging with it in good faith.

I just finished reading through *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism* and am, frankly, unimpressed. I thought the book generally was [poorly argued and had a loose relationship with fact](https://featherlessbipeds.substack.com/p/no-google-isnt-literally-stealing). This was relatively surprising because of the praise it has received:

The Guardian thinks that *Surveillance Capitalism* is the “first definitive account of the economic…condition of our age.” The Financial Times thinks it’s a “masterwork of original thinking and research.” It received positive reviews in The New York Times, The Intercept, The New York Review, The New Statesman, The LA Review of Books, and the Wall Street Journal. It is blurbed by an extraordinary amount of luminaries. Zadie Smith thinks it's the most important book published this century. It merely made the Guardian’s list of the top 100 books this century — admittedly, this was a weird list, including a Young Adult novel that bravely asks the question “What if white people were discriminated against instead?” Perhaps *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism’*s most impressive achievement is that it topped the list of Barack Obama’s best books of 2019, despite the book's own scorching indictment of the Obama Whitehouse’s relationship with Google. 

I'm not going to go into all the details because the issues I had with it go beyond just economic facts and quite a few are normative rather than positive, but it is worth highlighting several positive claims the book makes about the economy that are suspect.

&#x200B;

**I. Debatably false claim that 30% of people in the UK are excluded from routine social participation** 

The author writes that “Research in the UK showed that by 2013, poverty fueled by lack of education and unemployment already excluded nearly a third of the population from routine social participation.” 

Having checked the study she cites (while I am all for making fun of the British economy) that is not what it says. The study, in fact, does find a negative relationship between income and social participation, except for the bottom third of the income distribution, where it is essentially flat (except for the poorest, who, oddly, have a slightly higher rate of participation). The study makes no finding about the causes of poverty (i.e. that education and lack of jobs are the reason) and makes no finding that the bottom third are entirely excluded from routine participation (indeed the word routine does not appear in the study and the operationalization of social participation is through religious participation, political mobilization, and a  neighboring index that includes measures of attitudes like ""a willingness to ask for advice from someone in the neighbourhood"" noneof these are necessarily ""routine"") merely that they all share a reduced level of participation. 

To be fair, the statement just says that they are excluded, not that they are entirely excluded, but conjoining it with the word routine does seem to suggest that the participation levels are near zero, [which is not the case](https://imgur.com/a/UApA5wB)

*The Study Cited:*

“Emanuele Ferragina, Mark Tomlinson, and Robert Walker, “Poverty, Participation and Choice,” JRF, May 28, 2013, 

 [https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/poverty-participation-and-choice](https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/poverty-participation-and-choice)

**II. The US Poverty Rate was \~50% in 2014**

The Author argues that “By 2014 nearly half of the US population lived in functional poverty, with the highest wage in the bottom half of earners at about $34,000.” The author cites two reports on this. Both reports place the poverty rate at \~14% using multiple different measures of poverty, that is not nearly half.

Of course, Zuboff is slightly hedging here by qualifying it as “functional” poverty. I still don’t think we can arrive at an interpretation of this as true. The share of Americans who have an income that is double the poverty line is still way under 50%, per her own citations. A further oddity is that the reason Zuboff brings up this fact is to decry the disintegration of the social safety net. But, transfer payments and in-kind benefits, notably, are not captured in wage measurements, making that 34,000 wage number not necessarily the one you would want to look at. 

Additionally, I can't actually seem to find the 34,000 wage number in either study she cited, but maybe I am just missing it.

**III. Google is not subject to legal constraints**

The Author claims, in reference to Google, that “No moral, legal, or social constraints will stand in the way of finding, claiming, and analyzing others’ behavior for commercial purposes.”

Assuming that one considers financial penalties an impediment to one's way, laws have stood in Google's way at several points, here are two:

**IV. China does not use economic data to send people to reeduction camps**

The Author, in reference to the Judgement Defaulter's List used by the government to track failure to repay debt in China writes that ""“No one is sent to a reeducation camp, but they may not be allowed to purchase luxury goods. ”

This is misleading as the Chinese government is currently using predictive data analytics that include banking records to send members of minority populations to reduction camps [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/china-using-big-data-to-detain-people-in-re-education-before-crime-committed-report/article38126551/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/china-using-big-data-to-detain-people-in-re-education-before-crime-committed-report/article38126551/)

Well shit, I guess I'll have to give it a serious go. In his article, Wanner pores over a large dataset from Canadian surveys to test if parent's socioeconomic status, gender, first language spoken (remember this is Canada) are predictive of ""how deep"" into the education system a child will go (using OLS and logit models). 

The paper might be in a Sociologists' review, but it's effectively econometrics and the findings are important because they act as evidence of the educational system's effectiveness at helping economic mobility.

Wanner follows the sociologist Mare's (1981) model where each level of education is seen as a ""stage"", and students will decide using a cost benefit analysis at each level if they should continue with their education.

The paper finds that gender and language inequality in education have been practically eliminated in the 20th century, but that economic class inequality in education persisted, despite massive investment in the Canadian education infrastructure.

Importantly, the paper finds results that agree on all counts with an important study by Shavit and Blossfeld in 1993, which find there is no trend in the effect of socio-economic background on higher education. 

As levels of education increase in the model, there's a steep decline in the ""mother's status"" and ""father's status"" predictors' values in the regression. 

While rich parents' kids will pass high school more often, they're not going to grad school much more than poor kids. Not to repeat myself, but these findings are important as far as policy recommendations go, because they obliquely imply that the investment in higher education infrastructure is inefficient. 

**RI:** This paper might have been given a pass, except for the fact that it was written in 1999 and James Heckman and Stephen Cameron wrote [this](http://athens.src.uchicago.edu/jenni/econ312_2003/Life_Cycle_1998.pdf) masterpiece of a paper in 1998. The Heckman paper is about unobserved differences in the Mare model we talked about above.

To explain this, lets assume the Mare sequential model where at each level of education you're faced with the decision of working your way to the next level or not. You make a cost benefit analysis taking into account not only the value you will get from subsequent education, but also the likelihood you will pass the next level of education. 
This likelihood we can refer to as a student's ability (or motivation), which a student can observe but the researcher obviously can't. What Cameron and Heckman show is that not accounting for this unobservable variable causes omitted variable bias and invalidates the results of your regression.

In simple terms, the deeper level of education we look into, the more we get a sample that self selected for higher ability. People who know they don't have the ability to go for a certain level of education likely won't attempt it. So the result that Wanner(1999) and Shavit and Blossfeld's (1993) found where the predictors decline in value as the level of education increase is entirely explainable by the unobserved ability variable (which increases with level of education and corrects for self selection bias).

As such, Wanner's article above gets the official stamp of BadEconomics.",VodkaHaze,t2_89d6j,0.92,33,16

797,5yimtf,2017-03-10,badeconomics,Bad Controls: The Controllening (with math!),"We have debated the issue with ""bad controls"" in the past, and today's post on GWG reminded me of the topic. This is not really an RI, but I've been working through a parametric example / model of bad control to better understand the problem, and I figured maybe it could be of interest to others, although it's somewhat technical. Hopefully the mods won't mind too much. Alternatively you could say I'm RIing myself (slightly).

(tagging /u/besttrousers and /u/commentsrus who may be interested)

The model is inspired by [Montgomery et al. (2016)](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/post-treatment-bias.pdf), who also have some further references to the literature on bad controls (apparently this topic is known in other fields as post-treatment bias). Compared to them, I'm using continuous rather than binary variables and different notation.

So imagine the following statistical model:

* T is a binary 0/1 random variable, ε and η are random normal shocks

* T, ε, η are mutually independent, exogenous and everything

* outcome y is given by y = β{y,0} + β{y,T} * T + β{y,x} * x + ε

* covariate x is given by x = β{x,0} + β{x,T} * T + β{x,ε} * ε + η

Interpretation: betas are coefficients. T is a randomized binary treatment (say, teaching randomly chosen coal-miners programming). An outcome y (e.g. earnings after some period) depends on treatment T, unobserved ""skill"" ε (could stand for intelligence or motivation) but also on some additional covariate x (e.g. how much time does the coal-miner spend on self-study after taking the course). The covariate in turn can also depend on treatment, skill and some orthogonal idiosyncratic shock η. We may expect that taking the course makes one more likely to study programming also in free time, but also that those with higher skill will be more likely to self study.

The model is not cast directly into a potential outcome framework, but hopefully we can agree on how to define the causal effect of treatment on outcome:

* β{y,T} is ""partial"" causal effect, i.e. change in earnings if we had the person take the course but kept self-study time fixed

* β{y,T} + β{y,x} * β{x,T} is ""composite"" causal effect, i.e. overall change in earnings caused by taking the course, including the effect of increase in self-study

Which is the ""true"" causal effect? It really depends on what we care about. Sometimes it's the overall effect that matters, but  we may be also interested in the partial effect (after all, if the whole effect of the course worked through motivating workers to study on their own, maybe there are cheaper ways to do that).

Moving on to the main result, let's say we have large data sample with observations on (y, x, T). What will we estimate when we regress y on T (and intercept)? And what happens when we regress y on both x and T?

* regressing on T and intercept only, the coefficient on treatment will be (in plim sense) equal to β{y,T} + β{y,x} * β{x,T}

* regressing on T, x and intercept, the coefficient on treatment will be β{y,T} - β{x,T} * (β{x,ε} * Var[ε]) / (β{x,ε}^2 * Var[ε] + Var[η])

(~~I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which reddit is too narrow to contain.~~ Simulations seem to confirm. Proof is left as an exercise for the dear reader.)

What these nasty math formulas mean is that:

* regressing on T only will correctly estimate the composite effect (after all, T was randomized)

* regressing on both x and T will *not* correctly estimate the partial effect if β{x,T}!=0 and β{x,ε}!=0 (essentially, X is endogenous, and if correlated with T, endogeneity will contaminate also estimate of coefficient on T). It would however estimate the partial effect consistently if either β{x,T}=0 or β{x,ε}=0.

To sum up: bad control problem is legit in the sense that even if we want to estimate the partial causal effect, adding more controls will not correctly estimate it if those controls are themselves affected by treatment and endogenous. Neither is there guarantee that it will give us closer estimate that the composite effect, since the bias and its sign depends on several coefficients.

OTOH, if we truly want the partial causal effect (like if we want to isolate pure discrimination component of GWG), not controlling for covariates is not the answer either. The correct solution would be to instrument for x, but that's easier said than done.

798,18u33vo,2023-12-30,badeconomics,r/Physics destroys the field of economics and reasserts itself as the greatest science of all time,"[https://np.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/166hrgu/what\_do\_physicist\_think\_about\_economics/](https://np.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/166hrgu/what_do_physicist_think_about_economics/)

Four months ago, a user asked r/Physics about whether or not they looked down upon economics, given that in his experience at a Spanish university, it was the case that physicists dismissed economics as something easy and trivial.

While some responses were both respectful and insightful, there were unfortunately many others that did not exactly have such characteristics.

**Economics is a BS discipline that is not actually a science**

>The previous commenters who said physicists and mathematicians laugh at economists a bit because their models are total bullshit and get to make all kinds of assumptions to arrive at a model that has no basis in reality is pretty spot on. The fact that is actually true about economics demonstrates why it’s less rigorous than physics or math (or biology, chemistry). The hard sciences cannot just take random things as assumptions, everything that is assumed must be observable or demonstrable in experiments and explained by a theory (and for physics, a set of equations). Math has to PROVE everything via deductive reasoning.

I challenge the user to name one basic tenet of economics that is not supported by empirical evidence.

>It’s fairly obvious that the first principles of economics have not been flushed out because no one can create an economic model that actually predicts markets or economies of scale any better than flipping a coin.

Basic supply and demand along with industrial organization, game theory, etc., go a long way in explaining market structures/outcomes.

>It’s not treated like a hard science because politics interferes with it and injects it’s bullshit into it constantly. We’re getting to the point now where politics is injecting its bullshit into everything, including the social sciences and biology via the pharmaceutical and medical care industries. If it starts happening more frequently and make it’s way into physics and math, it will strangle progress there just like it had in economics.

The assertion that politics has not influenced the hard sciences at all is quite difficult to defend when one considers history and current events.

As for the claim that progress has been strangled in economics, it encourage the user to read the [latest research highlights](https://www.aeaweb.org/research) released by the American Economic Association. They can be quite insightful!

>One of the reasons economics gets crap is because some of it is earned. Classic Chicago School econ is less and less supported by evidence, with behavioural econ getting much more play. Yet despite example after example where behavioural economics explains how people actually act as economic agents, there are still.people who hold Chicago School perspectives as the truth. It'd be like being a physicist that didn't support relativity or QM because they were in the Newton School.

For one, I am assuming that they mean neoclassical economics, and perhaps specifically rational choice theory since they are comparing it to behavioral economics. Schools of economic thought such as the Chicago School of economics are not really a thing anymore.

Next, while it is true that behavioral economics sometimes does better at modeling economic behavior  than rational choice theory, it is the case that for much of the time, rational choice theory is still adequate at explaining the decisions of economic agents.

Simply dismissing rational choice theory just because behavioral economics is sometimes ""better"" would be akin to throwing out Newtonian physics because of general relativity and quantum mechanics.

>Physics is the Queen of sciences because enough time and money can resolve theories completely. Economics is the dismal science because it's experiments cannot be repeated, leaving many competing theories unresolved.

Although it is unfortunately not as common as it should be, [replication](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20171031) does indeed occur in the field of economics.

It should also be noted that economics was originally called the ""dismal science"" by Thomas Carlyle, a 19th-century pro-slavery writer who expressed dismay at the fact that political economy often led to conclusions against the institution of slavery.

T**he Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences is not a** ***real*** **Nobel Prize**

>Ah do you mean the propaganda award (Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences) that economists have concocted to look like science.

The award was created by the Sveriges Riksbank in commemoration of the central bank's 300th anniversary, not by an international cabal of economists conspiring to gain legitimacy.

>Not even that, the prize is, like most things in economics, simply crude capitalist/neoliberal propaganda. Economists made up this fake Nobel Prize to look like science.

The majority of Nobel Prize winners have won for ideas/thoughts that are not exactly associated with ""capitalist/neoliberal"" ideology. Their claim is just as ridiculous as Peter Nobel asserting that two-thirds of the winners have gone to stock market speculators.

**Economists are neoliberal hacks who support the economic status quo**

>Capitalist apologists who firmly believe in the red scare propaganda and consider the ""Free"" Market to be an infallible supreme being.Moreover, they consider Marx either the devil himself or simply an idiot. Of course without ever having read a single sentence of his texts.But the most important thing is that they think capitalism is the best possible economic system. For them the history of mankind has ended with capitalism. People who completely seriously believe the unbelievable bullshit of Francis Fukuyama, Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek or Ludwig von Mises and think that it is the greatest wisdom. Oh and not to forget that they hate and fear socialism/communism/Marxism with religious fanaticism. Other economists are as rare as unicorns.

Economists are perfectly willing to accept that market policies are not always optimal while also not letting Marx live rent free in their heads.

And out of those four figures, practically none of them are ""worshipped"" by economists, with only some of Friedman and Hayek's ideas still being seen as relevant (and Friedman much more so than Hayek).

Also, I have the strange feeling that the user thinks about socialism much more than economists do...

>Pretty much everything about economics is political, whether economists deny it or not. Economic models are usually presented as apolitical to hide the fact that they are highly ideological. For example, increasing unemployment is advocated by most economists to fight inflation and is the program of most central banks. It hardly gets more ideological and political. This nonsensical neoliberal propaganda is everywhere and it is part of the mainstream economics which understands/sells this as scientific facts. Today, economics is only a tool to legitimize neoliberalism. Everyone I listed above is not policy makers but famous economists of mainstream economics. Their models and ideas are considered by most economists as some kind of holy writ and the pinnacle of economic sciences, although they are largely pseudoscientific. Well, but string theory is not used by most physicists to argue that the following fact is good and right for ""scientific"" reasons:  
>  
>[Distribution of wealth - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth)

Pretty much every economist advocates for a delicate balance between inflation and unemployment, which aligns with the goal of every competent central bank. It is asinine to suggest that they are somehow obsessed with lowering inflation as much as possible.

I do not think there is a single economist who treats those four figures and their work as some sort of holy bible...

As for their claim about wealth inequality, the [majority of economists](https://www.kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/inequality/) do think that it is a problem. And many of the panelists who voted disagree/uncertain did so because they perceived the factors *causing* inequality to be the problem, not inequality itself. Of course, there are disagreements over what are the exact causes, or over which cause is the most important, but the gravity of the issue is not at dispute.

>A very clear example that economics is at best just astrology for clueless politicians, and at its worst just an excuse to make tbe rich richer, was visible after the credit crisis in the Netherlands in 2008. Clueless PM Mark Rutte sought economical advice and from the economical community two opposite advices were given. A. This is the time for the goverment to support the people and (small) companies. B. Austerity. Fuck the people. Clueless Mark, being tbe rightwing little shithead he is chose B and dunked the Netherlands in an unnecessary long recession, actually one of the longest in the western world. The fact that an economical community can pretend to be a science and then, when needed, can be 50/50 split on what the best course of action is, while everybody has access to all macroeconomic information, shows that it is bogus and not science.

Countercyclical fiscal policy is seen as a reasonable course of action by most economists, especially when monetary policy has been exhausted. It is not a 50-50 split at all. Now, it is true that there is dispute over when exactly to execute such policy, and over whether or not the increase in debt outweighs the short-term economic stimulus, but the user fails to present this nuance at all.

Economic consensus has been reached on many other issues as well, as explained in the FAQ.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq\_methods/#wiki\_can\_economists\_reach\_consensus\_on\_any\_issue.3F](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_methods/#wiki_can_economists_reach_consensus_on_any_issue.3F)

>Econ teaches you how the status quo is correct and natural. It is the opposite of science and thus far easier to do and make money in.

The idea that economics merely defends the status quo is ridiculous. The [recent research](https://arindube.com/minimum-wage-research/) [into the impact of](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/137/1/267/6355463) higher minimum wages is just one single example of how economic thinking has shifted over time.

As for the claim that economists make more money than physicists, salary data from the BLS shows that physicists actually make more money than economists do.

Proceeds to disagree with the definition of rent seeking.,"A thread is posted to SubredditDrama with drama involving landlords. Naturally, this leads to an argument in SRD about landlords. The badecon begins [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/bzeq5k/op_thinks_that_his_landlord_is_extorting_him_and/eqs6y8n/), where a user asserts that renting out properties is rent seeking. This is a pretty understandable misinterpretation of the term 'economic rent.' However, this leads a user to point out that this is a misunderstanding of the term. Said user is downvoted, and where it gets interesting, as another user responds with a [definition of rent seeking](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/bzeq5k/op_thinks_that_his_landlord_is_extorting_him_and/eqs9ce4/) that very explicitly says that renting properties is not in and of itself rent seeking. From here, the argument evolves into [whether or not landlords create value and/or perform labour](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/bzeq5k/op_thinks_that_his_landlord_is_extorting_him_and/eqsdluq/), with some users pointing out that landlords do indeed create value/perform labour. There are several long argument chains here, but they all can be basically summed up by the above, so we'll focus on that.

RI: So what is rent seeking, and why is this bad economics? Rent seeking is a process in which one aims to increase their share of wealth while creating no new wealth. Common examples of this behaviour include regulatory capture, where regulations and policy are changed to artificially increase profits, and monopolistic markets. This leads us to question whether or not landlords create wealth. It can be tempting to assume that the answer is no, as it is not immediately obvious that landlords are creating wealth by maintaining properties. However this ignores two simple facts. The first is that depreciation exists. A car with 90 000km on it is less valuable than a car with 25 000km on it due to wear and tear, necessary repairs, etc., which we can generally refer to as depreciation. Landlords maintain properties and act against depreciation, thereby preventing the reduction of wealth, which is functionally the same as creating new wealth.

The second is that the land landlords lord over is more valuable by having properties rented on it and maintained. This is [pointed out](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/bzeq5k/op_thinks_that_his_landlord_is_extorting_him_and/eqslp88/), however it falls on deaf ears. Ensuring tenants and their apartments are maintained, processing new tenants, ensuring safety and security, etc., all make a property more valuable than if the property was not maintained. A pretty simple way of thinking about this is asking yourself whether or not a property would be more valuable maintained and managed than if it were not. Try not to strain yourself doing that.

This is not to say that it is impossible for a landlord to engage in rent-seeking behaviour. Regulatory capture, as I stated before, is rent-seeking behaviour, and if a landlord for example were to have zoning laws changed so that their apartment complex was the only one allowed, that would be rent-seeking behaviour. However, despite the fact that the two words are spelled the same way, economic 'rent' and property 'rent' are not the same thing.",StarkDay,t2_vdpras,0.97,255,140

Welcome to my first RI. I am but a lowly not-even-undergrad and have no formal economic education (this will change soon), so criticism is very welcome and I'm sure it will be needed. You can look forward to a not very sophisticated argument on my part.


>You could make a good argument that our problem is an oversupply of workers.


You could also make the argument that wumbo has no alts (am I doing this right so far?).

>Our immigration rate has almost halved since 2009, but we are still maintaining very high immigration at 1.4%. The government probably can't do much to raise this (and shouldn't - though it wants to for reasons I'll explain). It *should* be looking at lowering it. 

These “reasons” are to increase house prices, apparently. I don't even know how to RI that.


>Here's why.


Oh shit waddup, I'm ready.

>Young people in this country are struggling to find work. That's worrying because we are in a rapidly aging population.


Youth unemployment in Australia in June 2016 was 13.2%, a little below the average of 13.5% since 1978. This isn't too terrible, especially since Australia is in the middle of a transition from a heavily resource based economy (which was a significant source of much of our economic gains throughout the 2000s until early this decade). There has been a mild trend upwards since 2009, about 1% higher now than it was then.

>In a languishing job market, where wages aren't growing


For the record, Australia's Wage Price Index grew 2.1% year-on-year to the June quarter, whereas inflation was 1% for the same period. There have been some quarters over the past two years or so where real wage growth has been limited, but these are fairly isolated, and don't represent the overall trend (from a few years to a few decades long).


>too many skilled immigrants (and barely skilled immigrants) are filling the jobs that would otherwise be filled with young people - who then need to subsist on welfare. There is little economic gain in this beyond further inflating the housing bubble.


To the claim that immigrants (skilled and unskilled) fill jobs that would otherwise be filled by young people: immigrants and natives do not directly compete for the same work. In other words, they are imperfect substitutes, as they have different skills, not least in language, and seek different jobs - generally immigrants seek jobs that natives don't want to do or where there is a skills shortage. It is generally more advantageous to hire a native due to their cultural and language skills, amongst other reasons (racism). (On a more basic level, I what makes him think that immigrants in their “30s and 40s” have an equal skillset to those in the early 20s?) This is evidenced by [Ottiovani and Peri](https://www.google.com.ar/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w14188&ved=0ahUKEwiM8uChhu_OAhVCiJAKHdmmCvsQFggZMAA&usg=AFQjCNEDsjdj_EuMDT4Sg_LsNN-TQnkXhg) who show in the long run, even low skilled immigrants have a positive effect on low skilled natives’ incomes. In the short run, there is some wage depression for natives which can be rectified with redistribution, a sentiment reflected in the low skilled immigration [IGM Poll](http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_5vuNnqkBeAMAfHv). (their high skilled immigration poll shows overwhelming support for it). Peri studies the [effects of immigration on productivity](http://www.nber.org/papers/w15507.pdf), which are vast and lead to an overall improvement for employment. [Boubtane, Coulibaly and Roult](http://ftp.iza.org/dp5853.pdf) find that, “using annual data over the period 1980-2005 for 22 OECD countries… in any country, immigration does not cause unemployment.”

>Now, that fucker is *going* to burst someday. You could make a solid argument it's already peaking (which usually lasts 12-18 months).


I really don't know much about the housing market so I can't comment on this but...


>A bubble is great for profiting the people who economically lucked out because they happened to be property owners when it began (in this case, the Boomers)


… the soak the boomers rhetoric makes me think that OP doesn't either. I seriously doubt his opinions are based on evidence. It's simple rhetoric. The whole post screams this.

>Alas... Our government loves immigration because it is a bandaid; it keeps the housing bubble from bursting *just that little bit longer*.


See above, immigration is loved because it has [generally positive effects on the economy](http://www.nber.org/papers/w12497.pdf), and is an effective medium term growth strategy. This is especially true for skilled migrants and natives (which is what the post is concerned with, rather than low skilled immigration).


>We also need to encourage births (which again needs to follow young people getting established, employed and financially secure) because immigration *cannot* replace births as a population sustainment measure - it just fucking can't.


TIL brown people are infertile.


>As our economy contracts, adding more and more and more immediate arrivals to occupy a finite number of jobs is not a solution


The economy is growing. Not sure how you can just state something so blatantly wrong? And jobs are not finite. How come unemployment has not massively risen with population growth (largely due to immigration)? Does this mean there have been… more jobs? Shiiiit.


>it's idiotic, myopic and it will come back to bite us in the ass.


As evidenced already, this is wrong especially in the long run. Immigration comes back to kiss us on (possibly in) the ass.

OP does suggest a targeted immigration scheme, which as far as I know isn't bad economics. But we already have them, in the form of the General Skilled Migration and 457 Visa programs. There are probably tweaks that could be made to improve skills targeting.


Other comments from the thread:


>The problem is just that there isn't enough work any more. More and more automation coupled with a growing population means less and less jobs. Immigration adds to the problem, but it isn't the cause, and halting immigration will slow the problem, but won't solve it.


Won't bother citing papers here because the overwhelming and very well-researched consensus is that technological change is the only consistent source of productivity growth, which in turn is the only consistent source of long term wages and living standards growth. Automation will displace some jobs in the short run, but will ultimately be a Kaldor-Hicks improvement, giving way for the government to make it a Pareto improvement through redistribution. Often disruptions of this kind have avoidable negative impacts because governments are too incompetent; they will need to improve skills in the economy, an area where government consistently underperforms, and aim redistribution at those hurt. I use the same argument for free trade. In addition, automation complements labour and raises demand for it through increased output due to productivity improvements. I think history is evidence enough for my point.


>I can't see an easy solution to this. A business owner has two options if they want to compete and make a profit; pay fewer employees to work more hours, or underpay more employees.

Labour is not the sole cost to business.


>The private job agencies will fix this problem. Any day now.

[So there are two claims being made here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/61qwss/the_fiat_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/dfhehe3/):

1. A $15/hr minimum wage nationally in the U.S. would be too high (as shown by evidence).

2. MW should not exceed half of median wages (as shown by evidence).

The bad economics is current literature on the subject doesn't show either of these points. AFAIK there are no empirical studies on a MW (in the U.S.) comparable to $15/hr, because it's never been done. [Current research on MW is contentious](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_minwage), though slowly moving toward acceptance as having negligible effects (previously being viewed as an ineffective price floor).

I've generally recieved less than favorable responses when I've asked for citations, /u/laboreconomist3 was nice enough to provide several. Of those I could review (I don't have a copy of ""The Natural Survival of Work"") *none* addressed excessive minimum wages, $15/hr., or the guideline of 1/2 median wages. This last proposal comes from an article for a think tank, which was [another response in the same thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/61qwss/the_fiat_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/dfha4hr/) I have a [link to the paper here.](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/state_local_minimum_wage_policy_dube.pdf)

In order, a review of the first poster's citations:

* [Why Does the Minimum Wage Have 
No Discernible Effect on Employment
?](http://cepr.net/documents/publications/min-wage-2013-02.pdf)

This article from the CEPR think tank provides a nice overview of current literature on minimum wage. Interesting tidbits from academia is they largely focus on one industry (food service) and mostly one demographic, teenagers. Already this raises issues for drawing broader conclusions as effects within an industry or demographic may be correlated for other reasons. It could be raising the minimum wage to $15/hr would signal a large decline in the restaurant industry while promoting other sectors as is seen with winners and losers in free trade or automation.

But I digress. The overview of academic work and meta analysis finds negligible, near zero effects on employment. There is some contention from one meta-analysis, Neumark and Wascher's but has questionable rigor and bias:

>""The  Neumark  and  Wascher  review,  however,  is  considerably  more  subjective  and  arguably  less relevant to the United States than the two meta-studies discussed earlier. Only 52 of the 102 studies reviewed by Neumark and Wascher analyzed U.S. data. Of these, Neumark and Wascher designated 19  as  ""most  credible,""  **five  of  which  were  their  own  studies.**19The  Neumark  and  Wascher  (2006) review  also  excludes  several  important  papers  that  were  not  published  until  after  the  review  was completed,  including  the  important  contributions  of  Arindrajit  Dube,  William  Lester,  and  Michael Reich (2010) and Sylvia Al
legretto, Dube, and Reich (2011) (to which we will return to below).""

Emphasis added (page 6, PDF page 8 of 30). None of the separate papers reviewed addressed excessive minimum wage increases, but instead focus on different aspects of employment effects given past increases, which typically are on the order of ~10% of past MW. The remainder of the article focuses on mechanisms in response to wage increases, so called ""adjustment channels"".

* [The Effects of a Minimum-Wage Increase on Employment and 
Family Income](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44995-MinimumWage.pdf)

This is a study put together by the CBO to look at the potential effects of increasing minimum wages to $9/hr. and $10.10/hr. It seeks to model outcomes in employment and income for such changes, and is *not* directed as assessing a $15/hr. MW or creating guidelines for an optimal MW. The projection itself is very tenuous, with the projected effects of the higher MW being, ""...in CBO’s assessment, there is 
about a **two-thirds chance** that the effect would be in the 
range between a very slight reduction in employment and 
a reduction in employment of 1.0 million workers..."" Emphasis added. Although a generous reading can conclude from this source a higher MW increase leads to more disemployment effects it is not strongly supported. The CBO made their calculations (page 21, PDF page 25 or 43) using past research on teen elasticties which is subject to [skewed conclusions.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Funnel_Graph_of_Estimated_Minimum_Wage_Effects.jpg) 

The CBO also concedes having adjust data of short term effects to make long term projections. See Page 23, pdf page 27 of 43 for a list of issues between past research and their desired projection.


* [Minimum Wage](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/minimum-wage)

This last link is just a survey of economists asking their *opinions* on two aspects of MW laws for a change to $9hr. Like anything else having to do with MW its inconclusive, at least for effects. Oddly enough majority opinion supports increases despite effects, which means even those who thought it was harmful to some degree still supported the increase. 

This following citation is from the second poster.

* [Proposal 13: Designing Thoughtful Minimum Wage Policy at the State and Local Levels](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/state_local_minimum_wage_policy_dube.pdf)

This is what often gets tossed around as the rule of thumb for prudent MW increases. What's of interest is that it's not a peer-reviewed work, and it simply takes a historical baseline as target. It's a very status quo argument, and while it may make sense as a conservative approach to ensure an increase known to be safe it does pose challenges from evolving standards of social equity. To further clarify my last point imagine if the gender pay gap of the past were addressed by such an approach. We would not see rapid increases in pay for women because that was beyond current experience, and so then would instead find the average disparate pay to men's median wage and seek to maintain that ratio. Dube does recognize this issue.

I suspect it also has a natural appeal as the poverty threshold for OECD statistical purposes is defined as [1/2 median household income.](https://data.oecd.org/inequality/poverty-rate.htm) Appealing as it may be for convenience this still fails to ground MW increases by empirical data.

In fact this paper in its conclusions states his proposal more cautiously, and even provides a citation for negligible effects well above his own guideline:

>""The proposed increase of the minimum wage to half the full-
time  median  wage  does  go  somewhat  above  the  range  from  
which we can draw the best empirical evidence. This obstacle is 
difficult to avoid given the rather low levels of minimum wages 
since 1980. A number of additional factors make it reasonable 
to apply the existing estimates when evaluating this proposal, 
however.  First,  an  increase  in  the  minimum  wage  from  41  
percent  to  50  percent  of  the  median  full-time  wage,  while  
substantial, is still cautious. It maintains the ratio within both 
historical  and  international  bounds.  Second,  existing  U.S.  
evidence  that  suggests  small  employment  effects  is  based  on  
a number of states (e.g., Nevada, Oregon, Vermont) that have 
all  raised  their  state  minimum  wages  to  levels  that  surpass  
46  percent  of  their  median  full-time  wage.  **Finally,  evidence  
from the United Kingdom suggests that raising the minimum 
wage close to the median full-time wage is not associated with 
sizable effects on employment (Manning 2012).**""

Emphasis added (page 9, PDF page 9 of 13).

In rebuttal I offer [this editorial by Krueger](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/opinion/sunday/the-minimum-wage-how-much-is-too-much.html?_r=0) of Card and Krueger fame, who is cautious as a matter of opinion, but is clear current research is inadequate to address such a question (it's worth noting Krueger has published no more research on MW since the mid 90s as noted in the CEPR article). Specifically he notes:

>""...but a $15-an-hour national minimum wage would put us in uncharted waters, and risk undesirable and unintended consequences.""

and

>""But $15 an hour is beyond international experience, and could well be counterproductive.""

The correct statement, and here Krueger is quite right, is that we don't know what would happen given a substantial increase in the minimum wage. There just isn't enough evidence, probably because such increases tend to err on the side of caution i.e. small increases. I respect his opinion, but as a matter of empirically derived evidence the question is unresolved.

Finally in support of my argued conclusion that a $15/hr minimum wage is uncharted territory we have the parting line from BE's own FAQ on the matter:

>""For larger increases in the minimum wage such as a 15MW, there is not good data to describe the potential impacts and larger employment effects are possible.""

For me this issue comes across as a thought experiment gone wrong; a return to laffer curve thinking. ""Well a priori there should be diminishing returns for ~~tax~~ MW increases, and at some point those should be so great as to make such an increase cause more harm than good."" And like the laffer curve we face the same measurement problem, where a ""reasonable"" person's opinion of what is ideal gets substituted for hard data.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
As an aside I can't help but think the community perception of this ""rule"" as being well grounded parallels with groupthink. Borrowing from another field experiencing a similar systemic problem I use the example in Lee Smolin's ""The Trouble with Physics"" were he recounts confusion over whether string theory has been proved finite (at the time of his writing it had not). In his account even non-string theorists accepted such a view though no paper had ever made such a claim. Like a bad game of telephone a weaker formulation was repeated until the stronger statement became conventional wisdom.

809,ufojxb,2022-05-01,badeconomics,Perpetual Myths of Welfare and Fertility,"On a recent r/me_irl [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/meirl/comments/udl21p/meirl/i6i690w/?context=3), a conversation broke out on the differing rates of birth between people in poverty and those not in poverty, and tangentially between developed and developing countries. 

&#x200B;

Quickly the erudite discourse which reddit is known for was in full sway, and some of the comments piqued my interest.  

&#x200B;

""Often because of poor education or lack of proper contraceptives.""

""And being poor you get more help from the government per kid. If your  worker class then having more kids is a death sentence. For upper middle  class it’s a dynasty. Then rich people usually try to have 3-4 kids and  keep it at that. The only people I see having 5+ kids are dirt poor  people or high middle class""

""Or welfare systems that pay out more depending on the number of kids you have.""

""Poor people don't plan well, part of why they are poor.""

""Can't afford contraception but can afford kids 🤔""

&#x200B;

These, sometimes contradicting, points are as hollow as the heads of the people uttering them, but I have heard similar remarks so frequently that I wanted to take the time to explain why this line of reasoning is an example of Bad Economics.

&#x200B;

I think it would be useful to summarize these points into 2  main arguments that these comments are making, and that I will be addressing.

&#x200B;

1. Welfare encourages more children, i.e. have more children is a result of a coldly calculated cost-benefit analysis, where the person in question is only interested in the extremely lucrative welfare check
2. People in poverty having more children is a result of some lack of intelligence and/or morals, and this lack of intelligence and/or morals is probably related to why they are in poverty in the first place

Not only are these points largely contradictory, they are also both wrong. 

&#x200B;

For the first argument, the 1990's saw huge changes to the welfare system in the USA. Out of concern that this very sentiment, that welfare encouraged some families to have more children, some states instituted some form of a ""family cap"" where after having X children a family would receive fewer, or no more benefits per a child.

As [this Brooking's article](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/is-there-an-effect-of-incremental-welfare-benefits-on-fertility-behavior-a-look-at-the-family-cap/) states, the family cap policies were not the result of any changing birth rates. This allowed the authors to treat the family cap policies as exogenous, and so they could use the states instituting this rule as a quasi-experiment. They find no impact, suggesting that welfare does not play a role in family planning. [Other reports](https://www.cbpp.org/research/family-income-support/temporary-assistance-for-needy-families) are similar.

&#x200B;

As for the addressing the second argument I want to quote some small sections of [Theodore Schultz's Nobel Prize lecture](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1979/schultz/lecture/), and I encourage people to read the whole thing. 

""Historical perception is also lacking with   respect to population. We  extrapolate global statistics and are   horrified by our interpretation  of them, mainly that poor people   breed like lemmings headed toward  their own destruction. Yet that   is not what happened looking back at  our own social and economic   history when people were poor. It is  equally false with respect   to population growth in today’s poor  countries.""

...

We   have learned that poor people are no less concerned about    improving their lot and that of their children than those of us who have incomparably greater advantages. Nor are they any less   competent  in obtaining the maximum benefit from their limited   resources. The  central thrust of this lecture is that population quality and  knowledge matter.""

Here ""quality"" is tantamount  to human capital. In short Shultz is addressing the same issue here, saying that it is not because of some lack of intelligence, or a moral failing that people in poverty have more children. Although it is true that [developing countries have higher fertility rates than developed countries](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/december/link-fertility-income), the meaning ascribed to this fact usually lacks ""historical perception"", as Shultz called it, and often involves throwing out the basic assumptions we would otherwise employ if we were talking about more well-off people.

&#x200B;

[The St. Louis Fed](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/december/link-fertility-income) offers; higher costs for raising a child in developed countries, differing rates of infant mortality, children taking care of their parents when they are older in developing countries as being potential reasons for the difference in fertility. 

An analysis in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/04/upshot/up-birth-age-gap.html) says ""Women with college degrees have children an average of seven years later than those without"" one possible reason being that women with a degree have a higher opportunity cost for starting a family as early as women without a degree. 

&#x200B;

In short, although there are of course factors that given the right data we can analyze empirically that impact birth rates, the idea that welfare would play an overwhelming role is debunked. Furthermore this idea, and the argument that the higher rates of fertility in developing countries, or amongst people in poverty in general, is evidence of some lack on their part is nothing more than the same lazy reasoning that Shultz had hoped we would leave behind decades ago.",Traansposition,t2_jm05txpp,0.91,189,45

It's actually a case of [badeconomiception based off this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/qsoen0/tiktoker_reinvents_the_principalagent_problem/). Your humble narrator responded to a comment stating:

>Anyone making more money will be more motivated to work at full potential.

I voiced mild disapproval for these reasons: beyond a certain level of low income, peoples productivity is untethered to salary/hourly compensation. I can get the argument that minimum wage employees don't get paid enough to care, and that being paid below a certain level means you can't afford things like stable transportation and child care which makes you a less productive employee. Let's just pick an arbitrary salary level for the sake of illustration. 

A worker making $30k per year can afford a stable life, and is working in job 1. Their benevolent employer raises their pay to $45k to continue to work in job 1. The worker thinks to himself ""wow, now that I'm making 50% more, I'm going to work 50% harder.""

Said no one, ever.

This cargo cult mentality belies the fact that there is a relation between compensation and productivity. According to supply and demand from econ 101, a job posting offering more money will receive more applicants than a job posting with less, ceteris paribus of course. The employer will be able to select better candidates that are naturally more productive because more people are applying -> the statistical probability of a hireable candidate goes up with an increasing pool of applicants (ceteris paribus). 

A good example was that I was in the job market a few months ago, I got 5 job offers, and I took the one that offered me the most money. I am of course completely reliable so when I tell you that the hiring company is benefiting from having hired me you should believe me. Those other companies didn't fork up the dosh so they're left with significantly inferior employees.

And that's when the argument started. 

I received a comment that:

>Even if you were to pose a commission based wage (which attempts to utilize this) you can't actually gauge the proposal that a person is naturally more productive out of a series by which you exclude others, or said another way, you never get to actually find out who is the most productive for the role because you only hire one out of the 100. You can't validate your choice is the best choice.

At face value there's truth there. No one is going to claim that every person was the best suited candidate for their role, but even at the level of an individual company and certainly across the entire labor market of a country the size of the US, if you hire the 3rd most productive rather than the 1st most productive candidate out of 250 candidates it doesn't matter at a material level. We're quickly approaching the edge of sanity here though. 

>Even if you were to pose a commission based wage

User claims that salespeople that are compensated up to 100% based on how much revenue they bring into a company are not being compensated on how much value they derive for the company. This kind of feels like when ""Fight for $15"" people go on Fox News and the retort is ""well why not just make minimum wage $250?""

>For instance very few people in most places would apply to be a CEO because they understand that they actually have no business running a company no matter the size meanwhile almost no one feels intimidated about working in a warehouse presuming basic physical ability therefore you aren't scooping the cream of the crop up with high wages at all.

User claims that you need to force people to be CEOs but people are lining up for warehouse jobs. Current headlines from newspapers seem to indicate that there is a [truck driver shortage](https://qz.com/2086977/there-is-no-truck-driver-shortage-in-the-us/) but I personally have never heard of a CEO shortage.

At this point I thought user just misunderstood what I said, it was a flippiant comment that I wrote while using the facilities so perhaps it would be easier to frame the same argument in an example. A company needs to hire developers to build features so they go into the labor market to hire. Some developers aren't productive enough, so they wouldn't get hired at all, some developers are great but outside the price we're willing to pay, and some are just right. Raising the wage offered would attract that great dev. It's goldilocks and the three inverted binary trees, I'm sure you the audience get what I'm referring to. 

In this I also point out that he's making the assumption that hiring is random. Whether you have 100 applicants or 1000 applicants if you choose one at random you're going to have the same statistical outcome. I explain that in general people hire candidates that they feel are a good fit, so if you're only hiring the top 10% of candidates, whether they only attract 10 or 100 starts to matter.

Referring to the warehouse, I point out that a warehouse would find more applicants and be able to choose better applicants if they increased hourly from $14/hr to $21/hr. 

In reference to referring to some dev candidates being more productive than others:

>How do you know this? I mean that word by the way, ""know"".

I receive a fairly long explanation on how it is impossible to assess any candidate on any ability to do any job. People lie you know? Secondly, how would a company evaluate how productive they are over a given period of time? It's not like you can just put a dollar value on it. 

>In fact in the warehouse example the 14 vs 21 might intimidate weaker people [...] This is a real problem by the way.

We now have scientific proof that offering more money in job ads results in less candidates applying.

Now I've hired a fair number of people over the years, and one of the things I do if the ad isn't getting enough applicants is raise the wage offered. It works 100% of the time to the point where I've never even considered that people could see a posting that was underperforming and not even consider raising pay. 

So at this point it's like... why? But I still persevere. You can assess the value of a feature that a developer builds by testing the market, focus groups, whatever. Almost every product that exists today underwent some evaluation on profitability before the company committed millions of dollars on building it. It's 2021, Jeff Bezos is out here calculating how many shits his drivers are taking and how that impacts how many rockets he can build.

>But in the case of your coders you might actually find that people who produce, according to your valuation, $200 code might say, ""I am not worth 120k, I am only worth $100k"" and simply opt out upfront never applying to begin with.

Guys, the biggest issue facing the labor market right now is that workers are undervaluing their labor to the detriment of the companies that employ them.

His argument for companies apparently using a random number generator as the hiring process:

>Most hiring is done through HR [...] doesn't actually guarantee the filter works well.

Look homies, go through my post history. I hate how dumb HR is with a passion, but there can be good HRs out there, somewhere, and it's a far cry from ""HR intentionally picks bad candidates for the hiring manager to interview"".

In reference to a company determining if a feature is worth building:

>F2 is just an IRR project. That's not knowledge. It's a projection.

812,4u679b,2016-07-23,badeconomics,Bad industrial organization from... /r/TheRedPill?,"Interestingly, there are tons of threads on /r/TheRedPill which try to apply economic theory to human sexuality. Unsurprisingly, most of these threads get the economics completely wrong. Let’s take a closer look at [this thread from two years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1yuzl4/a_must_read_redpill_analysis_of_the_dating_market/). It was hard to choose which thread to R1, but I decided on this one because it makes somewhat-clear economic arguments, whereas most threads of this type merely use the language of economics to describe noneconomic phenomena. 

The author starts out by modeling sex as a commodity, in which men are buyers and women are sellers:

> Women treat sex like a tradable commodity. Like every other commodity, sex is subject to the sacred underpinnings of economic law: Supply and Demand.

Now right off the bat the author makes the huge assumption that women are not also consumers of sex (i.e. they “demand” it). This is more of a sociological/psychological assertion, so I won’t look any deeper into this. While assumptions are a part of any model, the problem here is that the author does not acknowledge that this assertion is an assumption which underpins his entire model. The author also does not specify what women get in return for sex. I’ll assume he means that men do stuff in exchange for women. Since this stuff takes time and effort, it has an opportunity cost which we can express in terms of currency. So in exchange for supplying sex, we’ll say that the man does stuff for the woman.







Next, the author makes an assertion about the structure of the market for sex:

> It's a classic cartel situation, like OPEC. Women pretty much control the supply of sex: they ration it out and create an artificial shortage. Yet, demand is hot. That is why they can get us pay to through the nose for it.

 No, actually, it’s not a classic cartel situation. A cartel normally occurs in an oligopoplistic market and involves collusion among suppliers to set the price of a commodity at a level which maximizes profit. The author also does not explain what makes the supply of sex artificially low, rather than just being the actual amount of sex women are willing to supply. If I had to guess, I’d say that the author defines “artificially low” as “less sex than I want.” Now to be fair, the author later makes some Adam Smith-esque statements, explaining that women are not actually colluding, but behave as if they were, saying

> Women don't always consciously realize that this is what they're doing. There's no big conspiracy, this is just how women naturally seem to behave … As a result, the aggregate efforts of all these individual women acting in their own self-interests to optimize conditions for themselves have dovetailed together into what merely seems like a conscious implementation of a massive cartel.

Okay, so the argument is that women police other women’s behavior in order to keep the “price” of sex higher than its market value. Got it. To nitpick, “massive cartel” is a bit of an oxymoron, but whatever. The author then explains that this high price creates a sex shortage, saying

> There's a shortage of sex, therefore, the price is high.

Now I’m confused. Which caused which according to the author? Did the high price cause the shortage, or did the shortage cause high prices? See, this is the problem with a lot of Redpill economics threads: the arguments just aren’t clear. To my knowledge, there aren’t any Redpill economic models that use math, which is unfortunate, because that would make the arguments a lot clearer and easier to critique. As it is, there’s nothing more I can really say because the actual economics of the author’s argument is so sparse.

The rest of the post rambles on like this and then goes off on a tangent that I didn’t bother to read. 

I hope to do more R1s of Redpill economics, so I’ll keep on the lookout for some juicy threads. 

P.S. I think I might have found some bad game theory as well, but I don't know enough economics to critique it:

> The cartel is how women managed to bargain some measure of control over just about everything. That's just one of the myriad ways in which women counteract male power (or rather, male power might've originally developed to counteract women's sexual leverage over us? It's a chicken-egg paradox, to be sure.) That's just one way we're cowed into submission. Women think that they have to control sex because men control everything else... well, it makes as much sense to say that men have to control everything else because women control sex.

Brookings argues that Universal Basic Income won't solve poverty and would suck up the federal budget. Of course, UBI (in some form) is supported by a variety of figures from both the left in the right, so OP could have made a logical, well-reasoned post about how giving money away is the key to solving poverty. Instead, he accuses his opponents of being wealthy sociopaths and neoliberal shills.

>Right out the gate we start with a logical fallacy. We are not limited to these two options. These two options are being presented to us as the only two options because it is the only two options wealthy sociopaths are willing to consider. Removing subsidies for corporations, scaling back military funding, raising taxes on the wealthy, these are not mentioned, because the wealthy are not interested in even acknowledging the possibility.

[The main problem is that a UBI of only $12k/year is prohibitively expensive and would suck up 70% of the US budget.](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-06-06/universal-basic-income-is-ahead-of-its-time-to-say-the-least) Of course there are some savings, since we could eliminate social security, and move medicare to premium support, since after all the UBI was supposed to *replace* all other forms of social welfare. And keep in mind, this is for a UBI of only $12k/year which is less than what social security currently pays to the average retiree. A more ""reasonable"" UBI of $20k/year would consume 116% of the national budget.

Of course I haven't addressed his point yet about cutting back other expenditures. Let's look at hypothetically implementing UBI in the country of Denmark, which is near the revenue maximizing point of the Laffer Curve. According to Bernie Sanders it's socialist utopia with all the high taxes, high spending, and low corporate welfare an American liberal could want. (Denmark actually very neoliberal but that's beside the point) [Denmark taxes 48% of GDP per year, compared to 25% in the US.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending#As_a_percentage_of_GDP) [A UBI equivalent of $20k/year per person in Denmark would consume 90% of all tax revenues.](https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm). Remember, that implementing such a UBI would involve cancelling all public pensions, social security, government health care programs, with just 10% of tax revenues left to spend on the military, schools, roads, courts, prisons and other vital government functions.

>Victim blaming, and taking a ""we know best"" approach is terrifying. They are openly insisting that they know what people need better then the people who are asking for what they need. Piling on the mentally ill, and drug addicted is adorable, given that they've done literally nothing to resolve these issues in the first place. Using it as an example for why a policy which might actually help them would actually fail them is out of touch, at best, and maliciously psychotic, which is more likely.

Now we arrive at the big question: are economists maliciously psychotic shills or just out of touch? No just kidding: [would giving unconditional cash payments to drug addicts, the mentally ill, and the homeless generate long term benefits for their welfare?](http://www.drugandalcoholdependence.com/article/S0376-8716\(09\)00050-7/abstract?cc=y=) And conversely, [would offering conditional cash payments (on work, treatment etc.) promote greater welfare gains?](http://www.bmj.com/content/315/7110/703.short) 

The first study was a RCT between cocaine users and sober individuals. The first part of the experiment demonstrated that when given unconditional cash payments (the participation payment) the cocaine users performed much worse. The second part of the experiment demonstrated that when given cash incentives to perform well, the cocaine users performed equally to the sober individuals. In the second study I cite, patients who were paid to comply with medical treatment were more likely to comply in 90% of the literature reviewed. Therefore, giving unconditional cash payments to the drug-addicted is probably worse than giving payments conditional on treatment.

>P.S. I upvoted this article because people need to see how insane the wealthy have become. They are not capable of responding rationally. This is the face of your society. Irrational nutjobs with more wealth then sense.

[The wages of Brookings Senior Fellows are about $100k/year](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Brookings-Institution-Salaries-E21334.htm). That hardly qualifies as uber-wealthy. Also the irony is definitely lost on OP after he accuses his opponents of being irrational, sociopathic shills when presented with a reasoned argument against his beliefs.

BONUS UPDATE:
>I read the top response and all the others they were a big bunch of BS. And none of them addressed the essential problem that economics is going to have to solve and our current system will crash and burn if we don't solve it. That would be that according to the latest oxford study in the US alone 47% of jobs are going to be automated away over the next twenty years. That's an underestimate, because that doesn't consider knock on effects like the jobs that depend on the jobs that were automated. It also doesn't include the effect of globalization either. So I would say unemployment is going to be much higher than 47% maybe even a little higher than 50% by the end of the next 20 years. The great depression happened when we had around 30% unemployment. If you would like to argue that new jobs will replace these jobs then I challenge you to tell me where these jobs will come from and how the average joe will get them. I'd also like you to keep in mind that over 90% of the jobs available today are the same jobs available 100 years ago.

Highlights:

1. Predicts greater than 50% unemployment due to automation
2. Declares jobs lost to automation won't be balanced out by new jobs created through efficiency gains. Worse, suggests automation will actually destroy existing jobs further down the supply chain.
3. Asserts that 90% of current jobs existed in an essentially unchanged form 100 years ago.

Here, the user in question makes a few dubious claims about globalization, and then goes on to say that that means we should have less immigrants.

> If jobs are disappearing or moving overseas because of automation, why do we need more immigration? If the number of jobs is going to be much lower, we will obviously need less people to fill them

Here, the user commits the lump of labor fallacy, which is the idea that the number of jobs is static.  This is not true - if immigrants can preform labor for less money, that frees up money for consumers to spend elsewhere, creating new demand and new jobs to meet that demand.  Furthremore, immigrants can also start businesses and employ people.  Thee is empirical evidence that suggests that [immigration doesn't impact local wages very much](http://www.nber.org/papers/w14683).  Furthermore, economists [mostly believe that even low skilled immigration doesn't have too big of a negative impact on wages](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/low-skilled-immigrants).  And, unemployment is currently at about 4.6%, which is essentially full employment.

> If the jobs are going to be more skilled, then why are we OK with accepting immigrants and refugees with no skills and who can't speak the language?

Our current immigration system gives priority to higher skilled workers via things like H1B permits.  High skilled immigrants contribute to our [economy](http://edq.sagepub.com/content/16/1/20.short) (link courtesy of /u/saw_wot_again)Furthermore, if they have ""no skills"" and can't speak the language, then why would they be getting employed over citizens?  The only explanations that make sense are either that there are jobs open, or that native citizens won't do the jobs that are open.

> If the reason we need immigration is not just to fill jobs that ""Americans wont do"" is to pay into Social Security, then obviously there is a huge problem with Social Security. If it requires infinite growth, there will be a huge problem somewhere down the line. It would be much better to address that problem than to keep throwing bodies at it.

This is a rather unrelated claim, but I want to touch on it a bit - while it's true that social security is definitely going to need cuts to actually get it to work, in the medium (edit , again, thanks to swa) term we need all the help we can get to prevent it from going insolvent.

> The Ford plant that is going to be built in Mexico will pay it's workers 3 dollars an hour. Now that is a huge amount of savings, plus they don't have to pay for benefits and there are less regulations so it will save them lots of money. Now who benefits from this? The cars wont get cheaper, this isn't how the market works. They will sell the cars for the most the market will pay.

False.  If a company can produce things more cheaply, unless it is a monopoly, it will reduce prices to compete with other companies.  For example, when one looks at the effects of NAFTA on prices, Americans overall [benefited from it](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~noy/362texts/NAFTA-US.pdf).

--------------

It's commonly said that *""cryptocurrency markets are manipulated""*. Today, you'll see one example of how that particular sausage is made.

[The SEC][1] cites price manipulation as a primary concern when rejecting bitcoin ETF applications. Some [crypto hedge funds][2] retort that ""markets can't be manipulated because they're too big"", which we'll show is nonsense.

While cryptocurrencies have grown in popularity and market capitalization, the volatility of the price has not diminished. One recurrent feature of crypto price is the [BART pattern][3], where periods of low volatility are punctuated by spikes of extreme volatility. The name comes from the resemblance to [Bart Simpson's head](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BART_FIGURE.png)

Volatility spikes like the ones in BART patterns are caused by cascading liquidation events. Speculators making [leveraged bets][4] get forcefully wiped out.

Today, we'll dive into one such market manipulation event with loving detail, the **July 26th Bitcoin short squeeze**. The data I've used to research this is the full Binance orderbook (data courtesy of [CoinStrats][5]) at the millisecond level. Here's what the price data for the event [looks like:][6]

*Note: All charts have hi-res versions if you click on their links*

Note the extreme spike in BTC Futures price compared to other markets. Among Bitcoin mass liquidation events in 2021, this [isn't the largest](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LIQUIDATIONS.png)

The largest liquidation events are forced selling (red bars on the bottom chart, AKA long squeeze). This is because many more crypto speculators are taking leveraged long bets (borrowing to buy more BTC) than short positions (betting that the BTC price goes down). People who speculate on Bitcoin are as a group an optimistic bunch.

The reason we're looking at July 26th rather than [April 18th][7], [May 19th][8], or [December 4th][9] is that it's a better example to write an article about.

The July 26th event has both a clear order book manipulation as well as a classic media manipulation campaign, showing how actors that profit from these events operate.

### The Bullshit Amazon Bitcoin story

The BART pattern in this short squeeze is punctuated by two major pieces of news.

Leading into the upward price spike was a false story about Amazon accepting cryptocurrency payments.

The downward part was instantly triggered by Amazon's official denial of the false story.

In between the up and down part, there's a side-story about [Tether receiving target letters from the DOJ][10], which had a very short lived price effect.

# Timeline of Events

Here is the [timeline of relevant events][11].

Before we get into the actual data analysis, let's take a stroll through the dismal state of online media and how it plays with cryptocurrency.

### July 23rd: Amazon job posting

On July 23rd at 4PM, [Business Insider][12] published an article about an [Amazon job posting][13] looking for a ""Digital Currency and Blockchain Product Lead"" in their Seattle office.

This article is better than the abysmal displays of journalism we'll see later. But still takes considerable liberties to maximize its clickthrough rate.

Reading the job post, you'll see it is looking for a manager to *""develop strategy and product roadmap""*. Translation from business-speak: nothing is built and we don't have an idea of what, if anything, to build, so we're hiring someone to look into it. This is what the amazon spokesperson says in the BI article:

*""In an email to Insider, an Amazon spokesperson confirmed the job posting and the company's ambition to eventually accept cryptocurrency from its customers.""*

Over the next few hours Business Insider AB tests the headline away from reality and into fiction. We can trace this thanks to the [web archive][14] ([picture](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2021-12-26-at-8.10.26-PM.png))

A handful of publications report on this over the 24hr, with no measurable reaction in the cryptocurrency markets.

# July 25th 9AM: The CityAM article

The next important event is Darren Parkin's [CityAM article][15] titled **""Amazon ‘definitely’ lining up Bitcoin payments and token, confirms insider""**, alleging that Amazon will imminently accept Bitcoin payments. All important information in the article comes from an unnamed ""insider"".

36 hours later, [Amazon will deny the article wholesale][16].

By September Amazon [will have removed the job ad][17]. I searched private job ad databases, and that job was never actively advertised or promoted before being taken down. [footnote]This sequence implies one of two things: either the job was already filled internally and the job ad was put up to comply with HR procedures, or Amazon took the position down. Given the position was for a new team's manager, and no subsequent development positions were advertised, it's safe to say Amazon has scrapped the entire cryptocurrency project.[/footnote]

**Note:** I have made requests for comments to both Darren Parkin and the CityAM editorial team. None have been answered.

CityAM has never published a retraction or correction on their article. Rather, they [doubled down][18] on their claims, insulting ""anonymous critics"".

We're not here to take a third rate rag and their inept journalistic practices to the pillory. We're here for the market manipulation. CityAM is but an unknowing cog in a greater machine, happily amplifying the lies from a planted fake source.

### Trading up the chain

Everyone who consumes articles online should read [Trust Me, I'm Lying][19] by Ryan Holiday. The book describes how economic incentives in the online media industry has brought about a second era of [yellow journalism][20][footnote]Recently, subscription based revenue models like Substack, Patreon or the NYT/FT/WSJ subscriptions have started making inroads. Subscription revenue is incentivized towards quality, unlike advertising revenue, which incentivizes clickthrough rate and hence sensationalism[/footnote].

More importantly, Holiday details a common strategy to exploit the broken state of click-driven media, called **""Trading up the chain""**. This scheme starts by planting a lie or half truth at a low quality source (blog, twitter, low-tier news site, etc.). You then ""trade it up the chain"" by having successively more reputable sites report on the report.

Often, by the time you see something bending the truth on your twitter feed or the front page of Reddit, it has gone through 3-4 iterations of this. Each iteration further optimizes for attention by shedding context, exaggerating, foregoing important details, rewording claims, or just outright lying. See Business Insider's headline optimization in our example, for instance.

Media bubbles where fact checking is light, like cryptocurrency reporting, are subject to this. This is also true of politically charged topics, a good example is detailed in this [article on ""Hydroxychloroquine as a COVID treatment""][21] and how it was traded up the chain from a Google Doc to Elon Musk and Donald Trump.

### Preparing the field

Planted false stories being traded up the chain, like the CityAM piece, are part of a pattern. These stories prepare the field for market shenanigans triggering mass liquidation events.

Now, before we dive into the financial aspect of the price manipulation story, we need to cover some background knowledge.

# The Cryptocurrency financial ecosystem

While people think the main innovation of cryptocurrencies are public blockchain ledger transactions, the vast majority of crypto trading happens on private centralized exchanges. Crypto exchanges like Binance, Coinbase or FTX are interesting because they fill multiple functions that are typically segregated in financial markets:

*   A **Custodian** for crypto assets. Getting hacked is a big problem in cryptocurrencies. Blockchain transactions are irreversible, unless your name is [Vitalik Buterin][23]. This makes crypto a great asset to steal or use for [ransom payment][24]. Exchanges solve custody problems because they're less likely to get hacked than you are.

*   A cryptocurrency **Brokerage**. An individual can use the exchange as a broker to place buy and sell orders, which the exchange will go execute for them.

*   A trading **Clearinghouse**. The exchange will match brokerage orders together and act as the final intermediary between a buyer and seller.

It's important to realize that **leverage works differently in crypto markets** than regular commodity or stock markets. In a market like the NASDAQ or CME, the [brokers][25] are separate entities from the [clearing firms][26]. In a crypto exchange, the exchange does both functions at once.

In normal markets, if you get unlucky with a leveraged position, you get [margin called][27]. Your broker gives you some time to give them more collateral or they'll liquidate positions. The broker itself also keeps a margin with the clearinghouse, as a secondary buffer to ensure proper delivery of all orders.

This is normally invisible, except in freak occurrences. One example is Robinhood in a [meme stock frenzy][28], getting margin called by their clearinghouse because of the unprecedented increase in market volatility.

### The fundamental problem of crypto leverage

Offshore crypto exchanges like Binance offer absurd leverage in the 20-125x range. But the exchange is both a broker offering leveraged products and the clearinghouse of the leveraged trades. This can easily create [""failure to deliver""][29] situations from the clearinghouse side. Take this example:

*   We are the only two customers on the exchange. I buy half a BTC and leverage it 10x. You short sell one BTC and leverage it 3x.

*   The market price instantly moves down 33%[footnote]as it tends to do[/footnote], which means you make 1 BTC in profit, and I lose the equivalent of 1.5 BTC

*   I get liquidated from my leveraged position. You should earn a full BTC, but I only have half a BTC to give you!

The exchange has a problem. You're owed more than I can pay you.

The exchange could resolve to pay you the difference from its [insurance fund][30], and lose money. [Carol Alexander suggests][31] that in large liquidation events, like on May 19th, it's possible the exchange misreports numbers to [avoid losing money to their insurance fund][32].

The other option is for the exchange to [auto-deleverage][33] you, saying ""actually you only get half a BTC"". In this case you lose money.

### Interconnected poker tables

The best way to think of crypto markets is that each one is like a poker table. When a trader wins, it comes from someone else's loss at the same table. The prices on all the tables are kept in line by [arbitrage bots][34] who simultaneously buy and sell on each market to keep prices in line.

Delivery is an issue in leveraged liquidations if you are on the winning side. You want to make trades in the place where most assets are. The market implicitly coordinates to a [focal point][35], where having a deeper pool of liquidity means leveraged delivery issues are reduced.

This focal point used to be the [Bitmex XBTCUSD perpetual futures][36], now it's the [Binance BTCUSDT perpetual futures][37].

The great [""innovation""][38] of perpetual futures is that it doesn't require delivering much of anything. Unlike a normal futures contract, where one party has to deliver the commodity when the contract expires, perpetual futures ""delivery"" is only the difference between the spot price and futures price every 8 hours.

This ""delivery-less"" format allows gamblers to take on massive leverage, because little of anything has to be delivered.

Currently, the Binance BTCUSDT futures is where [most cryptocurrency price movement originates from:][39] ([pic](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/btcusdt-volatility-transmission.png))

We can see this directly in the data. Here is a [10min slice of Binance's orderbook chart][40] of Binance BTC ""spot"" (buy orders yellow, sell orders green) and BTC perpetual futures (teal and purple). ([pic](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/orderbook_example-1.png))

I encourage you to open this chart in high resolution in a separate tab and closely look at it.

You can see the [bid-ask spread][41] for both order books move around as the price goes up and down. This bid-ask spread in each market is provided by similar bots as the ones exploiting price spreads between the markets.

First, note how unstable the futures book is compared to the spot. The spot trades within a flat range, then jumps up or down to correct and realign itself with the futures price.

This is common behavior - the futures market trade with so much more leverage, and hence volatility. Futures price movement [""leads"" the spot price movement][42] much of the time.

Also note that the futures price is slightly below the spot price. This is [normal backwardation][43], and common in futures contracts prices.

#### Automated Markets

The crypto market also reacts instantly to relevant news. Amazon released their denial of the CryptoAM story at 15:59EST (19:59UTC). If you had a bloomberg terminal you'd have [seen this](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bloomberg-news.png).

Amazon makes these releases at the end of NASDAQ trading hours. This is normal if you have to announce news important to your stock price. It's polite to give your shareholders time to think overnight before responding to important news.

On the other hand, crypto markets trade around the clock. High frequency trading bots reacted to the Amazon news in <5ms. Here are the order books [around the event][44] ([pic](ttps://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/amazon_drop-3.png)).

The price instantly drops in all markets. Market makers also show themselves to be fair weather friends - the order book vanishes instantly on the news of Amazon's denial.

Not only that, the market is good at differentiating false news from real ones [footnote]or Bloomberg terminal curators are at least[/footnote]. The market didn't react to the fake CityAM article. It instantly corrected on the Amazon denial. We also see [instant reaction to the tether DOJ news][45]

# July 26th 00AM: Sharp price rise

Around Midnight UTC on the 26th, there's an intense rise in price, leading to the liquidation event at 1AM UTC. Here's the [15min period before the liquidation event][46] ([pic](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sharp_rise.png))

We can't track the origin of the increase in prices leading up to the liquidation spike - none of the products on Binance seem to ""lead"" each other in the data. This leaves two possibilities:

1.  The price rise is organic. Maybe people woke up in China very excited about Bitcoin and Amazon!

2.  The price rise comes from price manipulation, but elsewhere. The classic way to manipulate a price is wash trading([1][47], [2][48]), where you both buy and sell to yourself at increasing (or decreasing) prices.

Wash trading works best when the market is thin. If your above-fair-price wash trades run into real orders from other traders, you'll lose money! You want to maximize the likelihood that you actually sell to yourself.

  **An aside on NFTs;** Because they're ""unique"" objects, NFTs are a perfect vehicle for wash trading. You can easily ensure you only wash trade to yourself. The common scheme is to wash trade with yourself until some credible dunce buys the NFT from you at your manufactured ""fair"" value, leaving you to walk away with real money.

If someone wanted to manipulate the price of bitcoin to approach a liquidation point, the origin point would not be a large and liquid order book like Binance BTC or ETH. The wash trading would happen at an illiquid and thin market, and the price movement would then propagate to Binance through arbitrage bots.

# July 26th 1AM: Liquidation Event

At 1AM UTC, the liquidation spike starts. [Here are the BTC orderbooks for the 4min period around the mass liquidation][49].

The event starts with a suspicious series of orders in the futures market, which we'll get into later. Then, a big price spike, with futures order book collapsing into chaos. The bid-ask spreads for both markets blow up.

We can't know which orders in this chart are liquidation orders and which are ""real"" ones - Binance [doesn't provide this data anymore][50] since the April 18th liquidation event.

We can still track what happened, however.

# Momentum Ignition

The manipulative trade pattern to start volatile price movement is called [momentum][51] [ignition][52]. The [ESMA][53] notes that this is marked by high volumes of cancelled orders. Here is the [relevant period's chart][54]. Note this chart also plots actual trades made as black X's on the order books. They were distracting in the other order book plots, but since we talk about order cancellation here it might matter to people digging in.

The way momentum ignition works is by placing a large attractive order, and quickly cancelling it when an opposite order is placed in response. This leaves the opposing order alone in the market, pushing up the price.

[Here is an example from a 20 seconds before the liquidation event][55], where a large attractive sell order is placed, then quickly cancelled when a buy order is placed by a trading bot in response later.

What we see at the event start is such a spoofed order getting placed at 0:59:38 UTC. The price is flat for 2s, but eventually the spot price drifts up. This creates an arbitrage opportunity. Bots place buy orders to arbitrage the sell order.

The sell order is then quickly cancelled, partially filled. The opposing buy order is left buying into a smaller market than expected. This jumps the price up a little, hence the name ""momentum ignition"". Interestingly this is quickly repeated in a ""ladder"" pattern.

This pattern is repeated at the [critical moment before everything explodes][56]

We see one small cancelled sell order (almost unfilled), followed by a very large sell order cancelled (partially filled), then implosion of the markets.

### Market making bots stopping

The second part contributing to the implosion of the futures market is the shutoff of market maker bots around 2.5s after the largest cancelled ""momentum ignition"" order. Here is the same plot as before in a [""flattened"" view][57].

We see the futures bid/ask spread holds for around 2s after the cancelled order. Then, instantly, the bots supplying the ask side are shut off. A gap develops between the bids and asks in the futures market. The spot market remains orderly.

In a few more seconds, around 1:00:40, the futures order book collapse into chaos. This starts dragging the spot market with it - notice the widening of spot bid-ask spreads. In a few more seconds, the futures prices are spiking all around the place between $40,000 and $48,000.

  **An aside on tether:** This shows why in the event where USDT breaks its dollar peg, a near-instantaneous market crash would happen. Because USDT denominates the volatile futures price but not the spot price, an arbitrage gap opens up. However, those bots are wired to assume the dollar parity, and thus are broken in this case. They will be quickly turned offline.The bots turning offline cause a low-liquidity environment in which the USD/USDT price parity correction happens.

# How market manipulation is done

So the ""market manipulation"" in this event is done in two steps:

1.  Spoofed orders that are quickly cancelled when opposing orders try to arbitrage them. This causes some ""momentum ignition"". These seem to be done in a ladder-like sequence.

2.  Turning off market-making bots at a critical juncture to ensure the thinnest possible liquidity environment for forced liquidations to happen in.

In this case, short sellers are liquidated and forced to close positions (placing buy orders). In the thin and chaotic futures order book that was created, this maximally increases the trading price, thus cascading liquidations.

We're unable to trace the sharp price increase preceding the momentum ignition event. So even though it may be caused by something nefarious, we can't confirm it.

# Whodunnit?

 **A note on attribution:** Any allegations made below are mine and mine alone. I don't even think the party responsible for this event have done anything illegal. Cryptocurrency markets are a lawless wasteland! They are the winners, and the retail traders getting liquidated are the losers.


Here are my conclusion relating to attribution:

**Most likely [Alameda Research][58]. Possibly some other algorithmic crypto trading firm, specifically [DRW Cumberland][59] or [Jump Crypto][60]**

It's reasonable to assume whoever planted the CityAM piece is related to the ones manipulating the price. However, the CityAM team does not respond to requests for comments, so this is a dead end[footnote]It's also possible the media manipulation came from a different entity than the one doing momentum ignition. Both may simply have seen the opportunity and acted on it independently. This seems to have happened in the Febuary 2021 liquidation event, where the media manipulators kept going for a week after the liquidation spike[/footnote].

Whoever has done this is a well capitalized, sophisticated algorithmic trading firm. They have been doing this sort of stuff for a long time. The orders leading into the liquidation event are precisely coordinated by algorithms that take a long time to develop and fine-tune.

Both DRW and Alameda fit this description. Both have been unsuccessfully dragged into court for similar behavior ([DRW lawsuit][61], [Alameda lawsuit][62]). It's possible, though less likely, some smaller algorithmic trading shops like [jump crypto][60] or [wintermute][63] fit this bill.

**Look at who profits**

There are two ways to profit from such a liquidation event:

1.  Take a long position before liquidating the short sellers. This doesn't help us narrow it down.

2.  Profit from the mayhem by having a bot arbitrage spreads in the broken order books.

As found in the excellent [tether papers][64] by Protos, both Alameda an DRW Cumberland commonly issue new USDT in high volatility events. You can manually trace these issuances on [TRON][65] and [ETH][66]. Digging into it, you will notice no new USDT have been issued prior or during the July 26th liquidation event.

This rules the ""arbitrage profit"" explanation out. Someone had to place large bets before triggering the liquidations.

**Circumstantial evidence**

If we can't find new USDT being used to profit from the event, can we see suspicious movement on some blockchains that help us attribute it?

The answer is yes. [Here is a list][67] of suspicious transactions. They are large one-way USDT transfers to Binance totalling $290m between July 25th 16:00 UTC and 20:00UTC ([1][68], [2][69], [3][70], [4][71], [5][72], [6][73], [7][74], [8][75]) ([suspicious picture](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-08-at-7.50.59-PM.png)).

Most of these addresses are payment rails to Binance. Algorithmic traders use such blockchain payment rails to move crypto between exchanges.

The simplest way to trace ownership of an address like this is to look at the first transaction. Here, the first inflows are from FTX and Huobi. FTX is owned by Alameda Trading and often used as their asset custodian[footnote]For instance, when Alameda issues new USDT they always send it to FTX first[/footnote]. The best guess then is that these $290m were sent to Binance from Alameda, right before the abrupt price rise and liquidation event.

This is bad economics because increases in the labor pool does not, outside of highly atypical situations, cause economic growth. Otherwise, people would be begging for open door immigration and the unemployment rate would be cheered when growing.

Even viewed more favorably (focusing on the wider possible skills available, the greater supply allowing producers cheaper labor) it's pretty clear that there's not going to be anywhere near a 1:1 parity of labor supply and growth.

Last, it ignores the fact that there's sort of a structural trade-off. Those women entering the workforce weren't just barefoot and pregnant, but barefoot, pregnant, and in the kitchen, and providing a labor outside of nominal economic registers that still has to be provided somehow. So unless your shadowy entity behind the whole business is Big Maid and the Chinese Delivery Lobby, the payoff's a bit unclear. ",pathein_mathein,t2_8dkq0,0.78,19,1
818,69b65l,2017-05-05,badeconomics,AHCA Repealing the tax on tanning beds is bad econ,"Originally written for Facebook, so this is written in non-technical language. 

TL;DR Republicans believe in redistribution of wealth but only for rich people who want to be orange. 

The AHCA repeals the tax that Obamacare levied on tanning beds. 

Assume there is some price, P1 that people pay for health insurance. In a vaccum, given competive, acutuarially fair rates, this is equal to Total Costs of N people / N people, and each person is charged TC(N)/N, multiplied by some risk coefficient, adjusting the percentage of costs that you pay based on your level of sickness. Insurance companies do have SOME ability to discriminate based on usage (they can see your medical history/you tell them you have diabetes, so they charge you a bit more). 

Assume there is some price, P2, that people pay for tanning. Tanning increases your risk of skin cancer by some percentage, multiplied by the cost of skin cancer, makes tanners more expensive by T$ on average. In order to tan, a tanner pays P2, and receives some benefit (they like being tanned), call it B1. They do not pay T$. T$ is paid by the entire insurance pool, divided by the N people in it. 

Given the high costs of medical care, it is extrordinarily likely T$+P2>B1. In English, the private and social costs of tanning exceed the private benefit (there is no public benefit, I don't gain anything from you tanning). 

This means that because people who tan do not pay the full cost of their tanning habits, others do. They will tan more than they would if they had to pay the true price of their tanning. You will go from paying P1 for insurance to P1+T$/(N). So that someone else can tan. 

There is no mechanism by which an insurance company can tell if you use a tanning booth. They cannot adjust your premiums in order to charge you for it. The cost is averaged among all members of the pool. Lie detector tests aren't valid and the insurance industry can't afford to hire Private Detectives to tail all their customers to see if they tan. 

This is an externality. If there is not some outside actor (Government, local warlord, God, Fairy Queen, not my department) who imposes a tanning tax, then some asshole is tanning on your dime. The market cannot, under present legal frameworks, internalize this externality. (I suppose it is possible in a very Coasean legal system, insurance companies would be permitted to sue/otherwise recoup costs from tanning salons). 

There should be a tax on (tanning/smoking cigarettes/running around in circles because being dizzy is fun) equivalent to T$, so that the amount of tanning decreases to the socially optimal level, so that if you choose to tan, you pay what it actually costs to tan.

We rarely get bad econometrics!

RI:

In general, one can not assume that two different groups are identical when evaluating the effects of different policies.  All countries have different policies (other than the one being examined), cultures, industry concentrations, business cycles etc. that make it pretty hard to determine the effects of the policy in question, for all of the standard reasons (selection bias, reverse causality, omitted variable bias).

Looking at a time series is not going to be a good approach for determining MW effects, because they are generally overwhelmed by  business cycle effects. Dube has a nice post on this: http://arindube.com/2014/01/22/casual-versus-causal-inference-time-series-edition/

Lots of other fun badeconomics located within, most of which is pretty standard. We've got you typical BadMininumWage assertions, that neglect the last quarter century of theoretical and empirical work, and some BadChicagoSchool in which the Chicago approach is re-defined to be strictly about promoting libertarian philosophy, and not about rational actor models and empiricism (with libertarian promotion as a byproduct).",besttrousers,t2_3243k,0.99,34,70

821,fsskb4,2020-04-01,badeconomics,Incel theory is internally inconsistent and can be disproven using reverse game theory,"#Introduction: 

I was talking to a friend of mine before econ class, and somehow the topic turned to [incels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incel). So we're talking about them, then he says these words:

""Incels are just dudes with no game.""

Writing it out mathematically, the statement becomes, ""If you are an incel, you are a dude with no game"", so the [contrapositive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraposition) implies that if you could somehow give ""game"" to an incel, the incel would cease to be an incel. But I wager that if even if you somehow found a large number of [Hitches](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386588/) to give them ""game"", it would be completely ineffective, as the incel mindset is, at its core, anti-woman. At the basis of the ideology is a fundamental objectification of women, simply turning them into objects of use, and hence an incel would likely use that ""game"" to commit harm against women.

So we can't use ""game"", but still, how can we help incels, or at least prevent other people from believing their ideology and becoming incels themselves?

*Teach all people reverse game theory, also known as mechanism design.* 

#Background: 

Immediately, the question is why teaching people mechanism design will help with the incel problem. This is because incel theory has a huge mechanism design flaw. 

See, according to incel theory, [women](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/ffel57/nature_has_not_destined_them_as_the_weaker_sex_to/) [constantly](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/e306om/they_are_lying_with_their_mouth_but_their_actions/) [lie](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/ennpri/she_lied_to_me_twice_she_said_ive_seen_many/) [to](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/f0k5qa/women_are_unconscious_liars_who_dont_even/) [men](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/au6rph/redditor_claims_that_all_women_lie_and_manipulate/), [putting](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/b7vp7d/they_often_lie_about_how_looks_attracts_them_to_a/) [on](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/bs5lwe/youre_lying/) [a](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/cto4qj/women_are_driven_to_rely_not_on_force_but_on/) [show](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/cvilte/women_cant_be_interesting_if_one_seems/) that they're good people, when they [actually](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/fh3htn/i_got_tired_of_lying_and_told_him_the_truth_he/) just want to use men for various things. If a man is ""trapped"" in a relationship with them, women reveal that they're actually hideous [beasts](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/c6ko96/caring_supporting_and_loving_women_dont_exist_and/) simply out to use and harm men.

That is bad economics, specifically bad mechanism design. Using the aforementioned assumptions, we will prove that incel theory is internally inconsistent.

#The Model: 

Let's create the setting. We have one lady, whom we will denote as W. There are N guys who are attracted to her, and want to become her boyfriend. She will only have one boyfriend. 

The key thing to note is that *each guy does not know how much he actually values a relationship a relationship with W*. This is because W may seem great in public, but in private and in a relationship she may be completely different. Maybe she's just putting on an act, like incel theory states.

So the guys don't know their exact values (V) of a relationship with W, but they have expected values (E(V)), which are dependent on a signal (S) they each receive about W. Maybe the signal is a rumor they heard about her, an Instagram post, whatnot.

We will assume that signals are positively correlated with values. In other words, a high/low signal means it's more likely that a guy's true value of a relationship with W will be high/low. Furthermore, we will assume that each guy's signals and values are ""affiliated"" with the others'. In other words, the higher other guys' signals/values are, the more likely you will have a high signal/value. We can say that in this model, values are interdependent and not independent. Furthermore, signals are drawn from the same distribution for each guy. Finally, every guy is risk-neutral.

Let's take the point of view of one guy who likes W, and there are N-1 other guys. We will let S denote the signal of this guy and Y_i denote the i-th highest signal of the other N-1 guys. So Y_1 is the highest signal of the others, Y_2 is the 2nd-highest, and so on, until Y_{N-1} is the N-1 highest of the others, i.e. the lowest.

Now let's use the incel assumptions to construct the mechanism that decides who becomes W's boyfriend. Accordingly, W is purely materialistic, shallow, and in general a bad person. She only cares about what the guys can do for her, be it buying her food, clothes, and whatnot. Hence, she will only enter a relationship with the guy who is willing to spend the most money on her (maybe there are other things she wants too, but if so let's just take the [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)) to combine those things into one value). This means that each guy will keep trying to do the others in terms of how much they spend on her (assuming that budget constraints do not bind). As each guy declares how much money he will spend on W, this ""raises the cost"" of a relationship with W. Eventually, there will come a point where the expected utility from being in a relationship with W will be negative; this occurs for a guy when the cost is too high. And so he drops out. More and more guys drop out, until there are only 2 guys left in this spending game. Finally, one of the guys will raise the cost just too high for the other guy, and so the other guy drops out, and thus the guy who raised the cost becomes W's boyfriend. The cost to W's boyfriend is thus the point at which the second-to-last guy dropped out.

You may notice that this mechanism sounds almost exactly like W setting up an [English auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_auction). And since this is an English auction, we know from [Vickrey (1961)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1961.tb02789.x) that this is equivalent to a [second-price sealed bid auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction) in equilibrium for independent private values; specifically, the equilibrium cost at which a winner wins is the same across both auctions. However, values here are interdependent, so equilibrium is not exactly the same. However, I will examine the second-price case, because the qualitative result is the same, and it's also easier. Just for robustness though, we'll discuss how the final qualitative result holds when analyzing the English auction perspective.

Now, return to the guy whose POV we are taking. Let [this](https://imgur.com/a/6ygJbiU) be his expected value of a relationship, condition on his signal equaling some $x$, and all the other guys' signals being whatever they are. 

However, remember the setting! If this guy wins, he pays the cost at which the last person among the others dropped out. Furthermore, signals and values are correlated, and due to the symmetry assumption from above, we have that the highest signal equals the highest expected value of a relationship. This means that our specific guy only cares about the signal of the person with the highest signal among the others, because the cost at which that guy drops out is the cost our guy pays. So we can rewrite the condition expected value [in this manner](https://imgur.com/a/N5Bir6i), for some signal y.

Finally, we will let b^*(x) denote the cost one pays if he becomes W's boyfriend, given that his signal is x. So in the second-price sealed bid auction setting, since we are assuming risk neutrality here, [expected utility is like so](https://imgur.com/a/T2GVIMR). Let's draw a graph!

[Cost is on the vertical axis, and the highest signal among the other guys is on the horizontal axis](https://imgur.com/a/YQgQi0J).

Let's suppose our guy shares that signal. Then his cost function will [look something like this](https://imgur.com/a/k3Cdq0K).

Next, we'll graph the expected value of a relationship, [fixing our guy's signal at some positive value x](https://imgur.com/a/IJ2jCgN). Notice that this doesn't start at 0, since one's own signal is positive, so even if others' signals are 0, one will have positive expected value. Right now we won't prove why the slope is less than that of the b function; we'll shiow that later. But the intuition, I think, is clear: your own signal has a higher effect on you than others' signals, and while your own signal is constant in the expected value function, it changes with y in the b function. So the b function has a greater slope.

Now, remember that all the guys are risk neutral, meaning our guy only wants to win when expected value is greater than or equal to cost, or lose when expected value is less than cost. [So we add these labels to our graph, for convenience](https://imgur.com/a/ioSvgBX).

[Now observe that b(y) is another way of writing one's expected value given that your signal, and the highest signal among the others, is y](https://imgur.com/a/PML5fOT). This shows that the slope of the b function is greater than that of the expected value function when S = x.

Anyways, because of the previous observation, [we can characterize the reservation cost, i.e. the cost at which one is indifferent between winning and losing, as b^*(x)](https://imgur.com/a/OUM9Srl).

[And this occurs when one's signal is x](https://imgur.com/a/3Xx3wzx). So, what is the ramification?

Well, because of everything we have shown in the graph's thus far, we can define b^*(x) in terms of condition expected value: [it is the expected value of a relationship, given that highest signal among the others is the same as yours](https://imgur.com/a/nD4NIrK). In other words, for each guy, it is an optimal strategy to act as though everyone else has the same signal as he does, so as to guarantee that he drops out when the cost goes too high, but stays in when it hasn't reached that point yet!

#Proving the Internal Inconsistency of Incel Theory: 

Supposedly, it is in W's interest to lie and hide her true nature from the guys. But does that actually hold, assuming [W is rational and intelligent in the Myersonian, game-theoretic sense](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeegamebe/v_3a3_3ay_3a1991_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a387-391.htm)?

Let's say that W will also get a signal about herself. She can commit to one of two plans: Plan A is to reveal the signal, and Plan B is to not reveal the signal. Remember, her goal is to extract the largest cost out of the guys as possible. So given this objective, which plan is optimal?

Well, let's define new variables. Let X_i define the i-th highest signal overall. So for example, if we take the perspective of the guy with the highest signal, then his signal is X_1, but Y_1 is the next-highest signal, i.e. Y_1 = X_2 in this case.

Let us also define S_W to be the signal that W can choose to revealing or not revealing. Suppose that S_W = w. Then if she chooses to reveal it, a guy with signal x will act according to the above, while also taking into account W's signal, [in this manner](https://imgur.com/a/PHXHKsh).

Incel theory dictates that W's optimal strategy is to commit to not reveal her signal. Now, you may know of the [Linkage Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_principle), as proven by [Milgrom and Weber (1982)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1911865?origin=crossref&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents), which will tell you whether or not incel theory is correct. But we will do a direct proof here. spoiler: incel theory is wrong, and it is actually W's optimal strategy to commit to revealing her signal.

Now we know that W's benefit comes from the cost at which the guy with the second-highest signal drops out. So let us take the perspective of the guy with the second-highest signal.

[We begin with the identity between cost and expected value that was proved earlier](https://imgur.com/a/NYFtIIf).

Next, we will use the [Law of Iterated Expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_expectation). Using the LIE, we get [this next line here](https://imgur.com/a/1aHdcH5).

Next, since the outside conditions have your signal and the highest among the others equal to x, [we will fix those conditions for the inside as well](https://imgur.com/a/qmYEtt8).

[This next line follows from the identity between the b function and conditional expected value](https://imgur.com/a/ypFD6q0).

Next, we know that we are looking from the perspective of the person with the second-highest signal, [and as such S = X_2](https://imgur.com/a/KV50rDN).

Now we shake things up. Suppose that the highest signal of the others is greater than or equal to x. Since all the guys' signals and values are affiliated, it means that now, [the expected cost is greater than or equal to what it was before](https://imgur.com/a/Du12V8g).

Next, [we can simplify the expression like so](https://imgur.com/a/lJiN70F), since S = X_2 = x already implies that the highest signal among the others' is greater than or equal to x.

Finally, we know we're looking at the guy with the second-highest signal, so [we can get rid of the S](https://imgur.com/a/Lo65LNw).

What did we just prove? Remember that the cost W gets from her boyfriend is the cost at which the guy with the second-highest signal dropped out, i.e. his reservation cost. Hence, this proof shows that the reservation cost of the guy with the second-highest signal [is less than or equal to his expected reservation cost, given that W chose to reveal S_W](https://imgur.com/a/qAbLOxL)! QED.

**In other words, it is optimal for W to commit to revealing her signal, which proves that incel theory is internally inconsistent with its assumptions!**

#Discussion: 

The intuition is that the second-highest reservation cost underestimates the true value to that guy of a relationship with W, since the guy with the second-highest signal operates under the assumption that the highest signal among the others equals his. This is false, though, as the highest of the other signals is greater than his, and if he knew that, then his expected value would increase. Hence, by committing to revealing S_W, W corrects for this underestimate and raises, on average, the second-highest reservation cost. This is because her signal is affiliated with the highest other signal.

Now let's loop back to the English perspective. Using the Linkage Principle, it can be proved that English case has an expected cost greater than or equal to the second-price case. Furthermore, W revealing her signal yields the same qualitative result: this is more beneficial to her than hiding her signal.

Hence, teaching people mechanism design will showcase this internal inconsistency in incel theory.

822,ky6l95,2021-01-16,badeconomics,Noah Smith on $15 minimum wage,"[Post in question](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-15-minimum-wage-is-pretty-safe)

Just to preface this, I largely agree with the sentiment of Noah's overall post, but the evidence he uses to back up his claims isn't sufficient enough to match his claims imo. 

To start, he begins with a photo showing that the percent of economists who say that they agree with the statement ""Do min wages substantially decrease employment"" (paraphrased) has been decreasing over the years. To be clear, this is *not* the same as saying that they disagree with the statement either. In fact, the [2015 IGM poll](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/15-minimum-wage/) has a scale and a confidence weighting *for that exact reason. It *is* the case that economists are more likely to favor minimum wage increases, but $15 is a dramatic increase and in fact, in the latest poll about the $15 minimum wage, a whopping 15 of the 37 who responded indicated that they were completely uncertain about the sign of the effects and even more were uncertain of the actual magnitude of the effects. 

> I don't think the evidence supports the bold prediction that employment will be substantially lower. Not impossible, but no strong evidence. ~ Autor

> Low levels of minimum wage do not have significant negative employment effects, but the effects likely increase for higher levels. ~ Acemoglu

> The total increase is so big that I'm not sure previous studies tell us very much. ~ Maskin

> Our elasticity estimates provide only local information about labor demand functions, giving little insight into such a large increase. ~ Samuelson

> Lower, yes. ""Substantially""? Not clear. For small changes in min wage, there are small changes in employment. But this is a big change ~ Udry

The next piece of bad evidence is his handwaving away of Dube's suggestion of 58% of the median wage as a local minimum wage. Here is his excerpt

> Fortunately, there’s reason to think that small towns won’t be so screwed by a too-high minimum wage. The reason is that these small towns also tend to have fewer employers, and therefore more monopsony power. And as we saw above, more monopsony power means that minimum wage is less dangerous, and can even raise employment sometimes.

> A [recent study by Azar et al.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3416016) confirms this simple theoretical intuition. They find that in markets with fewer employers — where you’d expect employers’ market power to be stronger — minimum wage has a more benign or beneficial effect on jobs

Looking at the paper, this is not sufficient evidence that a $15 minimum wage will have a small or zero disemployment effect on small or poorer localities. For one, using [bains data](https://i.imgur.com/Q3f5ofi.png) and [pop weighted data](https://i.imgur.com/93ceGYZ.png) there are a significant number of localities where 50% of the median wage is quite lower than $10. That is 33% less than a $15 mw. The Azar paper finds that minwage earning elasticities much smaller than this and to back Noah's theory, it'd have to be the case that labor market concentration pushes down wages in such a massive way. Beyond that, the Azar paper warns not make the exact external validity claim that Noah is making! 

> One possible area of concern for an omitted variable bias arises from the fact that HHIs tend to be higher in more rural areas (Azar et al., 2018) while rural areas are plausibly less productive.  Independent of labor market concentration measures, then, this productivity difference might affect employment responses to the minimum wage.  Our expectation, however, would be that the minimum wage depresses employment more in less productive areas because in-creases in the minimum wage above the federal level are more likely to result in local minimum wages above workers’ marginal productivity.  This kind of bias goes against our finding that the minimum wage tends to increase employment in the most concentrated areas. 

There are attempts to control for it using population density, but the fact remains that the argument about disemployment that Noah is making simply might not apply for such a large change in the federal minimum wage in smaller localities. 

Noah ends with this quote:

> When the evidence is clear, true scientists follow the evidence. 

That's probably a little too overzealous when applied to this specific situation. While the evidence is clear about the pervasiveness of monopsony, it's definitely not clear that 1) economists are well on board with a $15 mw, and 2) that it will have a small/negligible effect on low wage communities.

Edit: It looks like [Noah does still believe that](https://twitter.com/Motoconomist/status/1350218312022687746?s=20) a $15 MW would have disemployment effects on rural communities, but that it will be lessened by his concentration argument. I was clearly not the only one who felt his language did not match that claim so I'll leave it as a point that still stands.",BespokeDebtor,t2_1ulabqy0,0.96,293,185

Bad RedPill Economics Part III: The Final Chapter


&nbsp;

[The article in question](https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/04/03/how-mass-immigration-is-driven-by-female-consumerism-and-low-fertility/)

&nbsp;

This article sucks. Not that I’ve come to expect much from the manosphere when it comes to economics, but this is really something else. Unlike the last article we looked at, this one is written somewhat coherently, which indicates that that the author did have enough self-awareness to at least and try and make his article readable. Yet unfortunately for us, the author was not self-aware enough to realize that he knows nothing about economics. Now I’m just an undergrad, but you don’t need to be Paul Samuelson to see that this is some Bad Economics^TM.  Unsatisfied with just violating the rules of economics, the author has also decided to violate the rules of basic human decency, writing up a racist, sexist, xenophobic manifesto that reads like the love-child of Human Action and Mien Kampf. Let’s dive in.

&nbsp;

**Part I: The Introduction**


What better appetizer for bad economics than some bad math? The author writes

> A recently released report reveals that a full 1 in 5 people in the United States are now either immigrants or their children. The growth of the immigrant population has been occurring at a rate of over 350% since 1965.

Here, the author misleadingly confuses total growth with growth rate, using the phrase “since 1965” to imply that this growth rate has spanned multiple time periods (meaning more immigrants) rather than being the growth rate for a single period: 1965 to the present. 









The author then introduces the main topic of the article

> This tidal wave of immigration has innundated the traditional American population, who have been asleep at the switch thinking that having children is either declasse or an antiquated notion. As a result, they are being demographically replaced in their own nation.

(By the way, unless he’s referring to Native Americans, the idea of a “traditional American population” is some Bad History.) So basically, the author’s saying that white people aren’t having enough babies because of feminism, and so are becoming a minority. Got it.

&nbsp;

**Part II: “The Consumerism Machine”**

 Here’s where the economics gets bad.

> In order to keep a consumption economy that needs perpetual growth running, the political and economic powers in our society need an ever-increasing population. 

 (I’ll let you figure out who the author means by “the political and economic powers in our society.”) 

A cursory look at history demonstrates that this isn’t true. The economies of Japan and Korea underwent periods of massive economic growth with comparatively-small population growth at different points in the past century. I think the author’s arguing that  population growth leads to more consumers, and that more consumers are necessary for economic growth. Apparently people can never increase their standard of living and consume more.

The author then makes a few smaller claims that I’m not going to waste my time on, because he provides no statistics to back them up. Claims such as:

> In the modern age, Western women now marry themselves to a corporation rather than a strapping young man.

Or

> Tragically, women are now looking for child replacements like cats and dogs to silence their maternal instincts.

I wonder who he had in mind when he mentions the “strapping young man” that gets ignored by women…

The author then makes a second claim

> Declining populations are correlated with recessions and depressions while growing populations are correlated with economic growth … Part of the reason the United States and Europe are importing so many immigrants is feminism has rendered white women statistically sterile. Birth rates are not enough to even sustain the population, much less create an engine of economic growth.


I have a feeling that the author is using the word “correlated” to imply causation. Not that it matters, though; there is no evidence that population changes move with the business cycle. The US population has been consistently growing over the course of the past century, during which the US has experienced several recessions. While it’s true that population growth can affect a nation’s standard of living, this is not the same as affecting the business cycle.  It’s also possible that people are less likely to have children during recessions, but this is a change in the rate of population growth, not the total size of the population.

&nbsp;

**Part III: “The Numbers”**

The author then says

> Women refusing to have families and children requires the flood gates of immigration to be swung upen because a consumer economy needs increasing numbers of warm bodies to buy its wares … Low fertility and mass immigration are leading to irreversible demographic change in the United States and Europe.

Once again, no they don’t. There are problems associated with declining populations, but this isn’t one of them.

The author then goes on a tirade about how white Americans are becoming a minority in their own country. But he doesn’t make any economic claims, so I won’t talk much about this part. The author does hint at where he’s going with this article, saying

> It seems in today’s world, destroying national sovereingty and cultures to turn people into shopping fools is an acceptable strategy by government in service of the corporate bottom line … Cultures are lost, nations are lost, but people can buy lots of shiny things they do not need.

So apparently governments are promoting consumerism… somehow in a conspiracy to enrich corporations. How exactly is the government doing this? The answer is… 

&nbsp;

**Part IV: “Free Market”**

… feminism. Of course. 

> The need for mass immigration to the West has been caused by feminism, and feminism was designed by a collusion of corporate and government interests to take women out of the home and turn them into corporate cogs and taxpayers.

This is a case of reverse causation. Modern feminism was in large part a result of women gaining economic clout because they began wage labor. Getting more women in the workplace only became a major part of feminism much later on. Once again, the author provides no evidence for his claims, and doesn’t specify which corporations are colluding with which government interests. 

The author then makes another economic claim:

> The rise of corporate monopolies and the disproportionate power they (using their government servants) exert over the lives of the average person is a corruption of the free economic market. In a free-market economy, prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy, and it typically entails support for highly competitive markets and private ownership of productive enterprises … Adam Smith knew that a completely unregulated market would see the rise of monopolies (like today’s corporate monopolies) and was therefore not free … The problem is instead of preventing monopolies as it should, the government has aided and abetted them.

First of all, monopolies have not become more prevalent. If anything, they’ve become less prevalent compared to during the late 19th and early 20th century as the field of antitrust law has developed.

We don’t even need to use a model to explain why the author is wrong here; he has confused the definition of “free market” with “perfectly competitive market.” Perfectly-competitive markets are characterized by a large number of buyers and sellers such that no one buyer or seller can influence the price of a commodity. It has nothing to do with government policy or private property. And while there exist certain “natural monopolies” and situations in which monopolies can occur in the absence of regulation, there is no rule that states all markets tend towards monopoly. 

The author concludes this part by saying

> One of the problems created by the unchecked consolidation of corporations, in addition to the issue of converging interests corrupting government and subverting the will of the people on matters like immigration, is wage gutting.

&nbsp;

**Part V: “Wage Gutting”**

> Corporate interests support increasing legal immigration even further, which has one major benefit for them: cheap labor … This is yet another example of the corporate-government complex at work. The tech industry doesn’t want to pay workers what they are worth, so they lobby Congress for increasing immigration to suppress wages.

While it’s true that corporations want more high-skilled immigrants in part because they are willing to work for lower wages, this is an odd criticism considering the author’s praise of perfectly-competitive markets in the previous section. In a perfectly-competitive labor market, workers are paid their marginal product, i.e. what they are “worth,” in purely economic terms. (Whether labor markets are truly perfectly competitive is another story.) An increase in the labor supply, say from immigration, would decrease each worker’s marginal product of labor, meaning that each worker would be “worth” less and would therefore be paid less. If anything, restricting immigration would make the labor market less perfectly competitive, because perfect competition implies easy market entrance and exit. 

&nbsp;

**Part VI: ""Environmental Impact""**

Next, the author talks about how female consumerism is supposedly being fueled by fiat currency

> As Stefan Molyneux has pointed out, if there was truly an effort to end overconsumption to solve the problem of global warming, world leaders would be saying the following about fiat currency and central banking: We must end fiat currency, we must end central banking around the world. Because central banking and the continued overprinting of currency and the taking on of national debt is causing a vast overconsumption of nature’s scarce resources. This should be the central and fundamental and irrefutable argument for ending central banking and returning to a gold standard. In short, fiat currency causes overconsumption. The need for fiat currency is caused by an economy that caters to women, who make 4 out of 5 purchasing decisions in a consumerism-driven waste economy. And the economy is supported by population growth which is no longer occurring in traditionally white nations since the feminist movement. It’s the perfect storm.

Now things are starting to get incoherent. What does central banking have to do with consumerism? The author seems to be arguing that the government is using monetary policy to incrase consumption and grow the economy. But if we accept that money is neutral in the long run, then monetary policy can only affect consumption and output in the short term, and not in the long term. 

&nbsp;

**Part VII: ""Men Failed As Guardians""**

Now that he’s whipped himself up into a frenzy, the author goes completely off the rails

> There have been warnings going back thousands of years in Western literature about the societal costs of not giving women proper direction. This is perhaps illustrated nowhere better than this type of economy cannibalizing Western civilization. Proverbs 31:3 is a good example of this ancient wisdom: “Do not give your strength to women, your ways to those who destroy kings.” 

First of all, Proverbs is from the Hebrew Bible, yet somehow that counts as “Western literature.” And I wouldn’t really call the above quote “ancient wisdom,” but that’s just me.

Then, the author goes full-on 19th Century racist and gives us this gem of bad politics:

> Conservatives are the more crucial linchpin to civilization. Without liberals, we might have worse movies and fewer charming coffee shops. But without conservatives, we might have no civilization at all, having handed over the keys to the White kingdom to babbling barbarians.  

Wew lad.











Then, to top it off, he shares with us some bad history:

> In normal historical cycles, the warrior would ascend in times of decadence and social disconnection to bring balance to the force. But these are not normal times. Feminism, the ideological spawn of Satan and his thousand reptillian succubi, thwarts the natural ascendency of the warrior class, allowing the shitlib devolution to continue unhindered and unchecked.

So apparently the ascension of “the warrior” is supposed to save civilization. What is this, Borderlands 2? Was this article written by Handsome Jack? Somehow I doubt the “handsome” part. However, I do think the “Jack” part rings true; as we’ve seen on our journey together today, the author clearly knows jack shit about economics.

First, a couple of definitions. Quantitative Easing is the ultimate form of expansionary monetary policy, where the central bank creates money to purchase securities. It's done when further conventional monetary policy is likely to be ineffective, such as when interest rates are already close to zero. In the ISLM model, QE shifts the IS curve to the right, whereas conventional monetary policy exclusively affects the LM curve. 

Modern Monetary Theory is the idea that any government that issues its own currency has no need for debt - any fiscal expansion can be financed through simply creating more money. While the basic concept is technically correct, it's not regarded as a viable policy in most circles, as its proponents usually don't consider the inflationary effects of monetary financing. 

>central banks worldwide are ... effectively implementing MMT (Modern Monetary Theory)

There's a crucial difference between monetary financing and quantitative easing - the aim of the policy. Monetary financing aims to bankroll fiscal policy, irrespective of the inflationary effects. Quantitative easing aims to force capital out of safer investments by depressing yields, thereby making it easier for firms to raise capital, which in turn increases investment, 
 and stimulates inflation and growth. While this may make expansionary fiscal policy cheaper, it's a side effect, not a goal. 

>The reality is that MMT is poorly named. It is not a theory and should be called Modern Monetary Practice (MMP) because, at its core, its central proposition is that it describes what central banks do.

Again - no central bank in a developed economy is currently engaging in monetary financing. Every sustained bond-buying program in modern times has always occurred when inflation and cash rates are >1%, and ceases as soon as the economy returns to long run equilibrium. It's a way of bridging the gap to avoid capital flight from risky investments. 

>Looking at the actual practise of creating new money, let’s say to finance an infrastructure project such as a railway, there are elements of the PPP (Public Private Partnership). The Government issues bonds. The banks buy the bonds. Meanwhile, the RBA stands in the market ready to buy the bonds from the banks. When the RBA buys the bonds, new money is created.

>It could issue $5 billion worth of bonds. The banks and other investors would buy them. Then the Reserve Bank would create $5 billion in new currency by crediting their accounts when it buys the bonds from the banks.

>The upshot? The Government has raised $5 billion worth of funds from the banks for its infrastructure project and the RBA has created another $5 billion which the banks can now lend to the private sector, perhaps to finance their contribution to the railway PPP.

Let's look at this through the AS-AD and IS-LM models. Under this model, an economy's medium run equilibrium output (Y\*) is set just before the slope of the aggregate supply curve starts getting increasingly steep. The role of most central banks is to keep the economy at Y\*, and its main mechanism to do so is through influencing investment, and therefore demand. The central bank's tools for achieving this are either through changing the money supply (shifting the LM curve) or changing the investment level (shifting the IS curve). A large bond purchase would manifest as a change in the investment level. 

If output was below Y\*, expansionary monetary policy would be beneficial. You'd see an increase in output with little effect on prices. Overall welfare would increase. However, if the economy is at or above Y\*, you'd see a small increase in output accompanied by a disproportionately large increase in inflation, hurting the economy and workers. Long story short, the key factor when deciding whether monetary expansion is beneficial is whether the economy is at Y\*. QE works this way, MMT doesn't. 

>To complete the circle, if we assume the Reserve Bank has bought some of the bonds and held them to maturity, then Mathias Cormann’s grandchildren will pay their tax and the money will go to the bondholder, this time the Reserve Bank. It then pays the money back to the Government, this time as a dividend, ergo more money for infrastructure

---

Wew, let's take this one step at a time:

> It's very probable slavery wasn't actually economically beneficial because it hindered industrialization.

I'm sympathetic to arguments that slavery made it so that the South found it more difficult to develop a manufacturing industry as it could simply depend on imports from the North.[[1]](https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2013/09/27/did-slavery-make-economic-sense) However, this assumes a counterfactual: that the South would have definitely developed strong industry without slaves. This is possible, but the south had a comparative advantage in large-scale agriculture in the first place because of its more fertile soils that could grow cash crops such as tobacco, cotton, and sugar. The latter two crops especially could not as easily grow in the North, which primarily had subsistence farms.[[2]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1836733.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A5b51c4e34434aadb2c217db1f19ad87f) Think about it this way: why didn't the South use slavery in manufacturing? Agriculture might have been more profitable anyway. Moreover, the largest ports in the U.S. were in the North (closer to the U.S.'s largest trading partners in Europe), and this could have benefited manufacturing independent of the North not having slaves.[[3]](https://www.nber.org/papers/w4710.pdf) If you don't buy that argument, there are plenty of other reasons why the North could have developed manufacturing even if the South did not have slaves. For example, nascent industries like newspaper circulation and hog packing boomed during Jefferson's trade embargo, which were more highly concentrated in the North.[[4]](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dirwin/docs/ip.pdf)

> You know the south was always poorer than it's northern counterparts, right?

* In 1860, the two richest states in the United States—per capita—were Mississippi and South Carolina.[[5]](https://books.google.com/books/about/Men_and_Wealth_in_the_United_States_1850.html?id=Za8rAQAAIAAJ) 
* ""In 1860, the economic value of slaves in the United States exceeded the invested value of all of the nation's railroads, factories, and banks combined.""[[6]](https://www.nps.gov/articles/industry-and-economy-during-the-civil-war.htm)
* The North *did* have more people than the south and estimates on all these figures certainly tend to vary[[7]](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~webfac/cromer/e211_f12/LindertWilliamson.pdf) (note also ""We also find that the South was initially much richer than the North on
the eve of Revolution,"") but it's definitely not settled that the south was always poorer.
* ""In 1860, 5 of the 10 wealthiest states in the US are slave states; 6 of the top 10 in per capita wealth; calculated just by white population, 8 of 10. The single wealthiest county per capita was Adams County, Mississippi. As a separate nation in 1860, the South by itself would have been the world's 4th wealthiest, ahead of everyone in Europe but England. Italy did not enjoy an equivalent level of per capita wealth until after WWII; the South's per capita growth rate was 1.7%, 1840-60, 1/3 higher than the North's and among the greatest in history.""[[8]](http://inside.sfuhs.org/dept/history/US_History_reader/Chapter5/southernecon.html) I know this isn't the best source, it traces itself to [this](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/king-cottons-long-shadow/) and subsequently [this book](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674975385&content=reviews) but I can't find a direct source on it. Would love a discussion about this in the comments. Nonetheless, I think the general point holds.

> And, up until the last 40 years, Canada (which had almost 0 slaves in its entirety) was quite a bit wealthier than the US?

I'm going to talk about GDP per capita instead of wealth per se, but in 1960 (almost 60 years ago), the U.S. had a higher GDP per capita than Canada.[[9]](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?name_desc=false) I don't have the PPP adjusted data that far back, but it's curious to me that current levels don't matter suddenly and what really matters when talking about the effect of slavery on economic growth is ""up until the last 40 years."" Is the argument here that all countries with lower numbers of slaves are wealthier than countries with more slaves? Brazil had many more slaves than Paraguay and is wealthier than Paraguay today, off the top of my head. Either way, this is a poor argument. Talk about omitted variable bias.

> You actually have to be [redacted] to think the west is affluent because it used some forced labor, seeing as how every continent in the history of the world had rampant slavery anyways.

> ""This will kill Canadian jobs because he’s pursuing a policy to tax dirty industry and chase it from Canada.""

 This really isn’t what Trudeau is doing. He’s pursuing policies to reduce emissions and foster innovation in cleaner technologies. An example of innovation already going on is 13 of the oil sand producers who hold 90% of the market in Canada working together to come up with clean technologies to reduce the environmental impact of oil sands. “dirty industry” doesn’t have to leave Canada, they just need to **clean** up their [act to maintain competitiveness](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian-framework/complementary-actions-reduce-emissions.html#3_6). Each region in Canada also has a lot of flexibility to implement policies to best suit their regions, and revenues gained will remain in their jurisdiction to be recycled back to those who are most negatively impacted by the [carbon pricing policies.](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian-framework/introduction.html)
It is also worth mentioning that Canada’s framework on clean growth and climate change has [complementary policies and actions to reduce emissions](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian-framework/complementary-actions-reduce-emissions.html#3_6) such as electrification of public transport, increasing renewable and non-emitting energy sources, making new and existing buildings more energy efficient and investing in technologies to help industries reduce their emissions. 

>""China does not have an equivalent tax""

China is one of the biggest clean energy advocates, it was announced in 2015 by the Chinese president that an Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) would be introduced at the beginning of 2017. This has been shaped by the evolving pilot ETS schemes China has introduced in Beijing, Chongqing, Guangdong, Hubei, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Tianjin. 7 of the 10 worlds biggest economies will have carbon pricing initiatives which is estimated to cover around 25% of global emissions by 2020. [see here](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/418161467996715909/pdf/105749-REVISED-PUBLIC-New-CPW-05-25-16.pdf)

>""You can’t just ship ALL industry out of Canada. There will be no jobs left. Time has come where we need to stand up on our own two feet and see domestic manufacturing flourish.""

DAE miss crappy manufacturing jobs? [Here](http://imgur.com/a/cK9hd) is a low effort excel graph (data retrieved from OECDstat) showing employment in manufacturing falling by half from 1970-2008 and rates of total unemployment doing its own thing, sitting around 7% for the most part. It’s an old argument but no, employment in manufacturing in developing countries has been and will continue to decline, this isn't a bad thing. MechEng blogger’s reason to stop the implementation of carbon pricing initiatives to reduce emissions isn’t a good argument at all.

He focuses on the cost to some industries and completely ignores the social costs that carbon emissions impart on society. Although there is a wide range of estimates for the marginal social cost per metric tonne of C02 emissions from $3-95, it is agreed that there are social marginal damages (costs) of GHG emissions. It should also be noted that these estimates are likely to be underestimated due to the difficulty of quantifying many impacts, and they are likely to increase over time. Short run estimates using MITs EPPA model of a $15 carbon tax imposed on the whole of the United States estimates an 8.4% reduction of the 6000 million metric tonnes of C02 emissions emitted in 2005, and a nearly 50% reduction in other GHG emissions. [see here](http://www.nber.org/papers/w14375.pdf) I know this is a study done in the USA but I think it is a nice example.

Hope this is decent enough, if not, I learned a lot about carbon pricing on this little journey and it was a lot of fun.

The Fed Up Campaign  who in their attempts to protest the fed actually are endorsing their actions. I wish I hate the time to breakdown there almost impressive inaccuracy on their main website
[So I discovered the group from this story](http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/article98041112.html#emlnl=Midday_Business_Report#storylink=cpy)
> The group, some wearing T-shirts bearing the slogan, ""We Need a People's Fed!"" posed questions about economic policy and the need for diversity to the Fed officials who took part in the 90-minute discussion.
""Our communities are being sacrificed for an inflation enemy that isn't here,"" said Rod Adams, a community organizer for Neighborhoods for Change in Minnesota.

Surprise, surprise they kind of agree with the group here. The Fed has a dual mandate of price stability *and* maximum employment  which means both are concerns for them. They specifically targets a rate of 2% inflation, and the current actual inflation rate in February this year was [1.02%](https://www.google.com/#q=inflation+rates+for+2015). 

The estimated full employment rate in the US which is estimated from being anywhere from 4.5%-5.5%. Which makes the us unemployment rate of [4.9%]( https://www.google.com/#q=us+unemployment+rate) pretty good.

 So if anything the fed isn’t afraid of inflation the problem being is to raise inflation is the Federal Funds rate combine this with the current Funds Rate is targeted at a rate of 0.25%-0.50%. Which means the rate can’t go much lower. So the fed is doing all it can to meet inflation and employment targets, and do exactly what they want.

Of course you don’t actually want to raise inflation, the reason why raising inflation actually combats unemployment is that is devalues the labor they are selling. Now that labor is decreasing firms can purchase more labor to meet their demand; which I doubt these fine protestors are arguing for. Which from their rhetoric is the exact opposite of what they argue. Specially
>When the rich’s wages grow up they call it growth, when ours go up they call it inflation

…. Anyway

>The coalition said it wanted the Fed and Congress to consider changes in the makeup of the boards of directors of the 12 regional banks to promote more diversity among a group of officials that is mainly white and male and dominated by bankers.

White they have a strong argument for partly because I don’t have the ethnic breakdown of the board of directors, and about [81%]( http://www.motherjones.com/files/Financial_services_diversity_charts_Artboard%208_0.png) of the financial industry is white so it’s not too suspiring they would fail on being ethnically diverse. 

In terms of gender 2 of the 5 seats on the governor’s board are women. The Board of the directors is kind of bad with a rough 1-2 ration of women to men. And here finance is a little better with almost half of the labor but the leadership is close to the same. 

But the reason why they want minorities is not to make the industry more inclusive (which it really does need to be) but because they believe that it will change the decision making process to prioritize their views. PoC would have new views on the topic, but I’d assume they are the top of their field and actually understand it so the chance they follow the ideas they subscribe is foolish.

**My lazy R1** 

I believe we have crossed the threshold of philosophy and into economics here. These sweatshops are a symptom of poverty, not the cause. /u/red-cloak your response is bad economics and flat out wrong, going against both empirical evidence and the consensus among economists. From the worker's prospective isn't choosing between college, a white collar job or a sweatshop, it's between farming for .50 cents an hour vs. working for Nike for a 1$ an hour. I don't see why the latter raises your sense of indignation and not the former.


As far as the ""alternative"" such as a UBI, keep dreaming, these are countries with GDP per capita of 5000$ or less. Let me put that to you in real terms. India with a GDP per capita of 2,900 $ has 100,000 cases of leprosy. One $3 dose of antibiotics will cure a mild case, $20 for a more severe one. WHO provides these drugs for free, but the health care infrastructure is not good enough to identify the afflicted and get them the medicine they need. So, more than 100,000 Indians are left horribly disfigured by a disease that costs $3 to cure. That's what it means to have a GDP per capita of $2,900. Your idea of some type of UBI is utterly unworkable in the countries we're talking about. Hands down, strong economic growth that comes from globalization, sweatshops and connect to the world economy has done great things for the world's poor. (Wheelen 2010)


Cheap Exports, and hence sweatshops have been the basis for the prosperity enjoyed by the Asian Tigers. You fail to take not that markets are voluntary, Nike is not using forced labor. If sweatshops paid decent wages by Western standards, they would not exist their comparative advantage is their cheap labor. You're confusing cause and effect, when you talk about Exploitation, the implicate assumption being sweatshops cause low wages. Sweatshops do not cause low wages in poor countries; rather, they pay low wages because those countries offer workers so few other alternatives. You might was well hurl rocks at a hospitals because sick people suffer there.


For the record, on your alternative of what happens when you close sweatshops. Renowned economist Paul Krugman has something to say: *"" In 1993, child workers in Bangladesh were found to be producing clothing for Wal-Mart and Senator Tom Harkin proposed legislation banning imports from countries employing underage workers. The direct result was that Bangladeshi textile factories stopped employing children. But did the children go back to school? Did they return to happy homes? Not according to Oxfam, which found that the displaced child workers ended up in even worse jobs, or on the streets-and that a significant number were forced into prostitution."" *

This new tax will be between 2% to 3.5% of the worth of assets within Argentina of every person whose assets in Argentina are worth more 200 million pesos (about 2.5 millon dollars at the current official exchange rate, far less in the real world exchange rate). 

This new tax is bad economics because iliquid assets are not exempt, and debts are not deducted. This means that people who have to pay the tax have to sell assets such as bonds and company shares, or demand high dividends in order to pay the tax. Not to mention people who borrow a lot of money have to pay tax on money they borrow even if they are broke. This tax also applies to any investment anyone makes in Argentina, so it makes it completely unprofitable to invest in the country. And although the tax is one-time for the time being, Argentinian history is full of emergency taxes that ended up being permanent.

Fortunately, there is already the Personal Assets tax which is very similar to the new wealth tax but exempts some iliquid assets such as company shares and bonds, so this new wealth tax might be ruled as unconstitutional for taxing the same thing twice. But our Supreme Court tends to side with the government and our government already violates the Constitution all the time so it's not a safe bet that this new tax gets thrown out of the window. If the new wealth tax sticks, it absolutely destroy Argentina's economy as everyone takes all their investment out of the country and all wealthy residents leave in droves.

However, a number of small changes in the aggregate study design have to be made in order to make the conclusive inferences more tenable.

1. There is a lack of consideration of heterogeneity with respect to implicit product quality

While he astutely observes a lack of structure or 'type' to Carly Shay's attraction, he doesn't mention Gibson's lenma, more commonly known as Gibby.

Going by similar micro theory decision assumptions, we can assume that Carly wants to maximize her utility with a preference for current period consumption over future period consumption (we assume a stochastic discount factor for Carly's consumption preference).

Gibby is an objectively superior product to Freddie, but Carly still doesn't choose to enter a relationship with Gibby. This shows a level of agent bias and irrationality, which would skew our standard errors and cause heteroskedasticity when we run regressions on Carly's preference rule.

Carly also betrays [Hicksian utility maximization](https://imgur.com/6GNZbuI) assumptions when she chooses not to enter into a monogamous relationship with Gibby. Let's assume Carly maximizes her utility, (u) to the price, (pi) and quantity, (xi) of the good in question. While Gibby does have a higher price than Freddie (restricting Carly to purchase less quantities of Gibby due to her limited budget constraint), Gibby has more quantity in terms of body mass and quality of time spent (due to his status as a luxury good), therefore making Gibby the better choice.

While the fact that Carly did not end up choosing Gibby further proves that she is indeed not shallow, we still cannot allow for the absence of a statistically significant variable from our estimation. This discrepancy in information and lack of predictability for the agent presents an information problem making the resulting regression suffer from omitted variable bias. My proposition is to enter the Gibby effect as an IV or a control variable to compensate for the bias of Carly's behavior, as proposed by [Angrist and Krueger, 2001](https://economics.mit.edu/files/18). I also propose the use of a difference in difference model to properly asses the changes in Carly's attraction levels over time and to also deal with the heteroskedastic nature of Carly's bias.

2) The infinite horizon / bellman equation model may not sufficiently model for Carly's changes in choice

While the infinite horizon model does a good job to capture Carly's consumption preferences over time, we have to consider the several boyfriends she entered and exited into relationships with before and during the show. In other words, Carly exhibits changes in behavior, but the bellman equation does not formally model the probability of changes or switches in her regime choices.

To compensate for this, I propose the use of a Markov regime switching model in order to allow for changes in Carly's decision rule. The function of this model would be to accurately measure the episodic nature of Carly's attraction, and the fundamental changes in her behavior following a shift in the underlying parameters: That is, a structural change in the market microstructure in question.

Because [u/MambaMentaIity](https://www.reddit.com/user/MambaMentaIity/) uses a Markov process in his R1, for this model, let's assume the probability Carly switches regimes (boyfriends) can be modelled by Hamilton filtered ( smoothed ) probabilities under a Markov regime switching model. The model is maximized under log likelihood. Let st be denoted as the 'smoothed' probability that Carly changes boyfriends and let st - 1 be the probability of the change in the previous episode. As such, the probability of a regime [switch can be modelled like this.](https://imgur.com/lFfyZVE)

If you don't like the Hamilton filtered probabilities, perhaps you'd prefer Quandt (1972) for Markov switching. Let's assume that nature chooses between regimes (boyfriends) 1 and 2 with probabilities **λ** and 1 - **λ** , where X is unknown to the investigator. As such, the [conditional probability density of Yi looks like this](https://imgur.com/IiyY5wJ). Through this, we can assume that movements of the state variable between regimes are governed by a Markov process, with the property expressed as

P\[a < yt < b |y1,y2,....yt-1\] = P\[a < yt < b | yt-1)

allowing us to properly model for the probability of changes in regimes for Carly's relationships more formally.

While the criticism [u/MambaMentaIity](https://www.reddit.com/user/MambaMentaIity/) made of the iCarly fandom holds its water, there are a number of tweaks that needed to be added in order to complete the model and rid it of biased estimates and potential model misspecification. I propose the Gibby effect as an IV, and for the use of a difference in difference model in order to deal with the heteroskedasticity in Carly's behavior. I also propose the use of Markov regime switching in order to formally model for fundamental changes in Carly Shay's psyche.",31501,t2_a5etixxu,0.97,332,12

From /r/technology comes another thread filled to the brim with an incredibly nuanced and sensible discussion of communications policy.

>The idea of something called competition in providing Internet service is ridiculous. Even if all four of the major competitors were in the same area, they would simply make a gentleman's agreement on prices. 

There are two aspects that make price fixing (or collusion in general) much more difficult to maintain that are present in this situation:

1.) It is more difficult to resist cheating in a collusive agreement as the number of competitors go up. With each additional colluding firm, the collusive joint profits get divided even further. This makes the alternative of cheating - by dropping price to capture all or a large portion of total profits - more attractive to any single colluding firm thus making collusion less sustainable. 

2.) A collusive agreement can be enforced if all participants can easily monitor each other, but if pricing is difficult to monitor, then it is very easy to cheat. ISPs, especially national multimarket ones, typically operate on a pricing model that involves new customer deals, haggling, and some price discrimination. This means that, for example, two people from the same customer profile can pay different prices for Internet service depending on if one is a new customer or if one is willing to call up their ISP to haggle on price and service. It should also be mentioned that bundling of services (e.g. Phone + TV + Internet for $109.99/month) makes it difficult to impute the price paid for Internet service alone. While AT&T might be able to look at Comcast's website and see the distribution of pricing for advertised offers, it is pretty much impossible for them to see the distribution of pricing among what all of Comcast's customers *actually* pay.

>I'm sure they're all friends with one another, know each other's wives, drink blood together, praise Satan together, and so one.

It's not entirely clear whether this commenter believes that pricing policy for large multimarket ISPs is set by local managers rather than a centralized pricing department. Such a scheme among ISPs (localized pricing management) would likely be very inefficient compared to taking advantage of scale economies. The HQs of ISP giants like Comcast, Mediacom, Charter, AT&T, Centurylink, etc are all spread out across the nation, so people responsible for pricing policy in their respective companies likely never interact with people of other companies on a regular basis. [It's not like they're a bunch of local propane dealers sorting out a price fixing scheme at their neighborhood diner.](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/kingofthehill/images/4/4d/132037.jpg)

It could also be the case that a market is served by 3 or 4 local  companies run by managers who's wives all drink blood together every Saturday at the local farmer's market or something, but this type of market (all competitors local) is very rare among ISPs if it exists at all.

To extend a small olive branch of fairness, it is legitimate to question whether a market can be made more competitive by adding a 3rd or 4th competitor. This is an open question and is actually an area of research in my PhD. But if I can point to one piece of research (to satisfy the R1 guidelines! :p), [Xiao and Orazem (2011)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167718710001384) use a Bresnahan and Reiss framework to study how subsequent entrants into local ISP markets affect profits. They find that markets get significantly more competitive as 2nd and 3rd firms enter into the market, but by the 4th entrant, competitive conduct does not differ.

Having had a recent discussion about Utility Theory on this sub, let's use this as the example. As I understand it:

Utility Theory is a paradigm in economics. So the concept has broad implications in economists' understanding of economy behaviour. Such as the rejection of households having running cost. 

From an applied science perspective a pardigm is a theory that has broad implications on our understanding of the world around us. A theory is a hypothesis that has been independently verified by many researchers. A hypothesis is a proposition that make useful testable predictions about why the world is the way it is. This means that if a prediction of a hypothesis or theory fails, this error provides useful information about the weakness of the hypothesis or theory.

If we consider Utility Theory it doesn’t make useful testable predictions. According to Samuelson and Nordhaus 2010, ""you should resist the idea that utility is a psychological function or feeling that can be measured or observed"". This is saying that utility is an abstract process. However, if it is an abstract process, how do we know it exists if we can't prove its existance through testable predictions?

Some economists believe they have proof of utility theory, through their work on utility functions. As Utility Theory does not make direct testable predictions, then the goal post of the defence of utility theory shifts. So the question is, is the argument for utility functions an argument for the paradigm (justifying the rejection of household running costs) or is simply showing that the choices of consumers under some circumstances can be ""seen"" to affect price.

Here we have to note that utility function are effectively a surrogate model (as I understand them). The means that they are an equation with unknow parameters, and the parameters can be found by fitting the equation to empirical data. In applied science (and economics) surrogate models are very useful tools but they are not proof of a hypothesis. This is the same as a statistical correlation provinding evidence of a fit with data, but not providing proof through independently verified useful testable predictions. 

So currently the philosophical apprach to knowledge in economics is not consistent with that of applied sciences. Evidence supporting this argument is that economics has schools of thought, whereas applied sciences do not. Psychology is the exception, although the different schools of thought are different approaches to therapy treatments and are not mutually exclusive.

I argue that if we demote Utility Theory from a paradigm and accept that households have running costs then it is possible to make testable predictions about economy behaviour. If you're interested in an approach to economics that follows scientific methodology, uses the mathematics of dynamical systems (used by many applied science subject such as meteorology)  and surrogate models of population behaviour the please go to my ResearchGate.net project ""Economy Dynamics"" https://www.researchgate.net/project/Economy-Dynamics",the1stEconomist,t2_kv97qrjq,0.42,0,73

>Value doesnt have anything to do with pricing though. Pricing is always cost +. If the schools costs havent changed (which they mostly havent, as you said they're still paying for the same buildings/loan installments etc) then they certainly arent going to adjust their pricing.

Value absolutely has everything to do with pricing. In economic terms, we have cost, price, and surplus. Cost is what it takes to produce the unit, price is what a consumer is willing to pay (even monopolies are constrained by demand), and surplus is the additional value generated by either selling at a higher price than willing to take (producer surplus) or buying at a lower price than willing to pay (consumer surplus).

Your run of the mill Econ 101 text book will show something like [this]( https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/consumer-surplus-1.png). Your run of the mill MBA corporate strategy text book will show something like [this]( https://imgur.com/9iWPS22).

If a business knows a consumer is willing to pay more, they will try to capture that additional revenue. We call that price discrimination and [it is especially prevalent in higher education.]( https://www.nber.org/papers/w23360#:~:text=We%20find%20substantial%20price%20discrimination%20within%20colleges.&text=A%20one%20standard%20deviation%20increase,range%20between%20%24110%20and%20%245%2C750.) So, value has everything to do with higher education pricing and while the [college wage premium is an excellent ROI]( https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/lkatz/files/the_race_between_education_and_technology_the_evolution_of_u.s._educational_wage_differentials_1890_to_2005_1.pdf), it may be [flattening]( https://www.nber.org/papers/w22935) and if the perceived value of a college degree decreases below the price offered by an institution, no trade will take place.

>In many ways the schools now have extra costs above and beyond what is normal, as they're paying for all the old stuff in addition to new software licensing and online learning infrastructure.

This is not the consumers’ problem *unless they value the education at least at the price offered*. Total cost = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs. VC has arguably stayed the same with increases offset by decreases elsewhere. I tried to find a public university system budget open to the public for free but was met with various fees I am not going to pay so this is just an assumption on my part. Fixed costs are probably the same as pre-COVID19 given they are fixed. Either way, the cost is not the consumers’ problem, especially in a competitive market. Which begs the question “is higher ed a competitive market?”

The answer is [maybe](https://core.ac.uk/reader/6606080) depending on how you define the market. Harvard is not North Idaho College no matter how many times my boss says so. [Online programs](https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f88388.pdf) also introduced competitiveness to higher education, but did not have a substantial effect on selective institutions like Harvard. So while the evidence suggests an online Harvard education is not the same as an online Georgia State education, consumers are decidedly changing their preferences. And every run of the mill MBA corporate strategy textbook will tell you consumer preferences and perceptions are all that matter. 

>But yes, the cost of schooling is vastly inflated above what is minimally required in general, IMHO.

I tend to agree but classroom discussion, especially for liberal arts majors, is important. At least it was for me and those classrooms were expensive (note: if you plan on donating to a higher ed institution, I highly recommend you donate to the operating budget. Everyone wants their name on a building but no one wants to pay to keep the lights on). This is more difficult to utilize or control in a video conference setting. We may be in the midst of a major disruption to the current higher education model.

846,knxkvq,2020-12-31,badeconomics,Multiple instances of bad organisational economics,"The post is Rule 1 multiple claims, with a common theme. 

**Claim 1**: /u/isntanywhere says: [The firm does not have power of fiat. Does not have any ""authority, no disciplinary action any different in the slightest degree from ordinary market contracting between any two people"". He does this so by quoting Alchian Demstez's famous 1972 article on information costs](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/iyx0ra/what_does_power_of_fiat_mean/g6j88oc/).

**R1, Claim 1**: Since that paper was selected in AER's top 20 papers of all time I should begin atleast by quoting [Oliver Williamson 1994](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117852?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)

> The argument that the firm ""has no power of fiat, no authority, no disciplinary action any different in the slightest degree from ordinary market contracting"" (Armen Alchian and H. Demsetz, 1972 p. 777) **is exactly wrong**: firms can and do exercise fiat that markets cannot

Williamson chalks the presence of Fiat within Firms to i) Forbearance Laws ii) Informal Organization. Organization economics, since Alchian Demstez has inquired into firm-market dichotomy and have illustrated their *comparative viability*, I will illustrate a few:

- The firm through internalization is able to solve the Risk Incentive Trade off better

Principal agent models which incorporates risk in production, the total product(f) is a function of productivity parameter (ε) and action of the agent (e). Both e,ε are unobserved by the principal while being observable by the agent. The total product f(e,p) is observed by both. The agent has a cost function c(e) s.t. c'>=0 and c''<=0. Therefore dis utility(-c) is convex. The principals problem is to design a contract which induces agent to produce the first best level of effort subject to i) the incentive constraint ii) outside utility constraint.

The problem is, if the worker has constant absolute risk aversion >0 or has a limited liability constraint or generally risk averse, no first best contract is possible the principal faces a risk incentive trade off. For a formal model and proof see, [Prendergast page 12-13](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2564725?seq=7#metadata_info_tab_contents) [Bolton Dewatripont text page 131-133](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/Contract_Theory/H57uDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover)

Since the principal faces the task of insuring the agents, while the agent undertakes an hidden action, undertaking this transaction within the firm (as opposed to the market) allows for i) better monitoring (distortionless observation of signals) ii) better design of incentive mechanisms, which is impossible in the market. As [Williamson 1975](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1816983?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) has put it,

> The advantages of internalization reside in the facts that the firm's ex post access to the relevant data is superior, it attenuates the incentives to exploit uncertainty opportunistically, and the control machinery that the firm is able to activate is more selective....... (page 117)

> Internalization does not eliminate the need for input evaluation. Rather, the advantage of internalization, for input monitoring purposes, resides in the differential ease with which controls are exercised. An external agency, by design, lacks recourse to the internal control machinery: pro- posed remedies require the consent of the contractor and then are highly circumscribed; unrestricted access by the buyer to the contractor's internal control machinery (**including selective use of employment, promotion, remuneration, an internal resource allocation processes**) is apt to be denied. In consideration of the costs and limitations of input monitoring by outsiders, the buyer may choose instead to bear the risk and perform the work himself. The buyer thus internalizes, through backward vertical integration, a transaction which, but for uncertainty, would move through the market. A cost-type contract for internal procurement is arranged. (page 118)

- Firms solve the ""You get what you pay for"" problem better.

This section is based upon 3 papers [Baker 1992](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2138733?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents), [Holmstrom Milgrom 1991](https://www.jstor.org/stable/764957?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). They differ slightly in their models but the results, non optimality of high powered incentives ie piece rates is smae.

We assumed in the previous section that the total product is unique and observable by the principal and can be written into the contract. However the agent is asymmetrically informed over what actions will do the principal good. Or that the principal does not know his true objective function. Similarly it may happen that the principals objective function is multi task, there are objective measures for some tasks while none for others.

For example: when one visits the doctor to get health advice the do not know what their true objective function is, similarly the management supervising the  scientists in academia or industry do not know their objective function vast majority of jobs in a knowledge economy suffer this problem. A teacher teaching students have the responsibility to i) create competence and ii) developing thinking ability while i) is contractible through test scores or exams ii) is non contractible.

In this circumstances a first best contract is not possible even when the agent is risk neutral. [Following Baker 1992 the optimal rate of incentive (b*) is given by the equation 8 in figure.](https://i.imgur.com/4V7miLd.jpg) [2](https://i.imgur.com/lANKjmC.jpg) P(ε) is marginal product wrt action(e) on the contracted measure (P) and V(ε) is marginal product wrt to e principals objective function(V), given state of the world ε. b* is directly proportionate to the correlation between both. Thus as Baker puts it,

> Since P(ε) may not equal V(ε) in every state of the world, the contract based on P gives the agent inaccurate information about how hard to work, and the agent suffers a loss of utility from this effort variation. **The result is that the principal chooses to reduce the effort variation by reducing the piece rate, with an attendant cost in terms of incentives for effort.**

Therefore high powered, objective piece rates fail spectacularly. Markets where the product desired is objectively represented and have the highest risk incentive trade off (no insurance full incentives) fail spectacularly too. Only within the firm where various i) subjective measures of performance are available ii) cohort monitoring is available iii) carrier concerns are available iv) repeated interaction is forced to take place that such problems are solved.

- Incomplete Contracts and Specialized Assets 

However More fundamentally Alchian Demstez neglects i) the presence of specialized assets (physical or otherwise) wrt to a transaction ii) contractual incompleteness. Specialized assets wrt to a particular transaction, 1) moves the transaction away from competition to bilateral monopoly 2) generates appropriable quasi rents(AQRs). This coupled with contractual incompleteness means that i) distribution AQRs cannot be contracted away ex ante ii) ex post their will bargaining about such rents, which is itself costly. See [Williamson 1989 page 142-145](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1573448X8901006X) In such a situation ex post governance institutions which can decide through fiat the appropriation of quasi rents. This leads to an ""optimal"" allocation.

Hopefully it has become clear from the above discussion that u/isntanywhere and Alchain Demstez are **themselves Delusional**, Firms do have power of fiat, higher authority and disciplinary ability, they exercise this through:

- i) dulling and crafting incentives in a way fit for the job which a market cannot; thus being able to punish and reward behaviour appropriately (Williamson's ""internal control apparatus"")

- ii) is able to access and act on data (subjective performance evaluation) which cannot be contracted and verifiable in a court (Williamson's informal organisation and Forbearance laws respectively). 

Lastly u/isntanywhere tries to make a difference between ""leverage"" and ""fiat"", claiming firms have first not the later. However this is exactly wrong, people on whom formal authority is vested within firm make decisions which affect the outcomes of the agents (ie they have discretionary authority). Such decisions cannot (are not) challengeable in the courts, nor do courts have the appropriate data to do this (see point 2). In this sense firms do fiat (ie engage in private ordering)

**Claim 2:**  From some time ago, u/RobThrope says multiple things: i) [""Why though is it common that the workers in several manufacturing steps work for the same employer? As Coase pointed out, the answer is transaction costs....However, each purchase comes with a cost. Buying and selling aren't free. For example, **it's likely that the soles that are bought will have to be inspected before they're used.**](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/7obi0v/what_do_bosses_do/dscky9z/) 

**R1 Claim 2:**

u/RobThrope identifies ""inspection costs"" to be a form of transaction costs which shifts the transaction from market to firm. The mistake here is obvious, while inspection costs are transaction costs however they are not *discriminating transaction costs*. Just because you do not buy an object in a market but instead procure it internally, the need for inspection does not dis appear. The work of an employee is surveilled and inspected continuously. 

ii) [""I'm sceptical of the theory that hierarchy is inherent in division of labour.""......""There's no fundamental reason why hierarchy is needed here.""](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/7obi0v/what_do_bosses_do/dsc6wgl/)

Theres a reason why Oliver Williamsons famous book is titled: [Markets and **Hierarchies**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1496220) or why Rajan and Zingales writes papers titled [**Power** in the theory of a firm](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2586908?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) or why Aghion Triole write papers differentiating [Formal and Real Authority in firms](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2138869?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents), it is not a left wing conspiracy to economically understand power, authority and hierarchies.

Knowledge and information costs as previously discussed are endemic it turns (given situations) hierarchies, control and authority allow optimal transactions.

**Claim 3:** Friends from the previous claims have come together they many claim: i) [""I sell you a service and you're not happy with it. You can sue me, or you can refuse to buy from me again. Suing may be expensive and not worthwhile......Rather than X buying from Y, both of those people work for the same boss who can deal with the interaction between them. Of course, this has it's limits, which is exactly why we do have markets in many goods and services.""](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/kiwwzu/why_does_the_majority_of_the_labor_force_work_for/ggtrdy5/)

It is not fair that he does not tell *Why* are there limits to internal priceless organization, why are not all economic activities organized under one boss? The above statements while do account for bargaining costs neglects influence costs. Next comes this claim about capital ownership, 

> ii) Some claim that capital is the reason.....Any type of physical capital could be rented out. So, why don't capital owners do that rather than employing people to work on the capital? The reason is often that the contracts that would have to drawn up would end up being impractically complex and extremely difficult or costly to enforce. Where capital can be easily rented out with fairly simple contracts, you'll see that actually being done.

While it is completely true that contracts of renting out capital is complex, contracts with respect to employment are complex too are also costly. Then what determines employing vs renting out? This has been explained by GHM,

Ownership of a physical asset confers residual rights of control, that is as far as the initial contract is incomplete (has missing provisions) this is filled up by the owner as the particular state of the world manifests. This allows the owner to appropriate entirely (or decide in the distribution of) Quasi Rents, which arise in relational contracting.",amour_propre_,t2_7rsngvx0,0.95,54,23

Then shouldn't we ban discounts or ""sales"" periods then?

Plenty of articles such as  [Is Inflation Good Or Bad? – Forbes Advisor](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/is-inflation-good-or-bad/) will be in the center.

Oh and the most outrageous thing is that the consumer is the one driving the economy. Everyone can do that, producing is the hard part. You can't consume without producing first.

>While higher prices make it more challenging for Americans to afford everyday essentials, inflation isn’t always necessarily bad. In some cases, inflation can be a good thing for the economy.

You can't consume if you don't have the money and you can't have the money to consume if whatever money you have loses value by 2%. People are poor because they don't have things and you can't have things if you don't produce them and you can't produce more if your COSTS are going up due to inflation. Inflation can be a good thing, feels like saying that ""I am happy that instead of being able to buy two hamburgers, I am very happy I can buy only one"". Is this for real what I am reading for?

How can we say that the economy is strong when we have a whole of 32 trillion? How is a business or a personal budget strong when the equity is minus 32 trillion and counting?

>Inflation is the word that economists use to describe the gradual rise in prices throughout an economy.

No, it isn't. Prices can go up and down. A price can be zero and for something to be zero, you need a baseline. Compared with what is zero? compared with the baseline which is the supply of money in all of its shapes which during our times is the credit. You can't say that a price is 32 if you don't have the means of exchange which is the supply of money.

Is like saying that a balloon can grow bigger without air going inside it. That air is the supply of money. You may have various points on the balloon walls where the pressure is slightly different or maybe rising than other points (due to external exposure to temperature) but that is normal as nothing is uniform in nature, but having a general rise in pressure in the balloon is abnormal and indicates that the quantity of air has increased.

We can very well have the price of oil rising but if the quantity of money doesn't, then other prices will readjust because more money goes on oil. Yes, the oil price increase will increase as a share in the total cost of a product but the other cost that forms the price of that product will go down and compensate.

We can't have everyone eating an extra apple (CPI went up) if the total amount of apples didn't increase in number. Is like saying that I had eaten two fish but I caught only one.

CPI or GDP are bad metrics.

>While inflation may decrease the purchasing power of your dollars over time, economists generally believe that a low, steady level of inflation is necessary to drive economic growth.

No, it isn't, how can I reach higher (grow) if you add with each step some more weight on my back?

>When an economy experiences deflation, the prices of goods and services fall and the value of money grows. As a result, consumers can purchase more items and services with the same amount of money as before  
>  
>Sounds great, right? The trouble is that some negative repercussions come with deflation.

As with inflation, it makes the confusion and ties deflation to falling prices now when in fact deflation as the word deflate means ""***let air or gas out of (a tire, balloon, or similar object)***; How can you deflate something (a price/tire/balloon) if there wasn't the air inside it in the first place?. You can't!

Not that only sound, but it is great. What is bad with people being able to afford and buy more things? If we wouldn't be able to do that, I would write this on a typewriter and not even sure about that. There are no repercussions.

I see ""economists"" all around saying that prices have to rise otherwise famine will be around. How can you tell me that I should be happy and that is good that my costs are going up? How can I sell more and to many more people when my prices go up year after year?

How can I be more productive or how can I offer lower prices when my costs are rising? Gosh, I feel that the more someone is studying the more ... they become at understanding the basics.

>Deflation signals falling demand for goods and services and increasing supply, which drives prices lower. This may indicate that consumers are pessimistic about the economy, spending less money, and holding on to their cash.

Not deflation but the fact that people can't afford to buy something signals that there is falling demand. Like, we people have infinite demand, what we lack is the products and a price that is not too high for us to afford it.

People don't hold on to their cash, they just increase their **savings so they can buy later when they have saved enough to afford.**

>Over time, deflation undercuts the production of goods and services, leading to layoffs and increasing unemployment. Some ~~economists~~ think that deflation is even more dangerous than inflation.

Nonsense, prices going lower makes it so that more people will be able to buy so everything balances out as production only increases as firms can sell more.

>Can inflation be a good thing? Surprisingly, yes. Some level of inflation is crucial for the economy.  
>  
>While high inflation can be harmful, too little inflation can also weaken the economy.

So you tell me that if I can't afford one hamburger then I should buy two of them? Or if I afford 1,2 hamburgers, now I should be able to afford only 1 because ""that's how an economy grows""?

>When the economy is struggling and inflation is too low, the Fed will take the opposite approach by lowering interest rates or buying assets to increase cash circulation. The goal is to make it easier for people to borrow money ""by **increasing the supply of currency**"" and spur economic activity.

So the solution when you struggle to carry 10kg is to borrow 5 more from someone else? Economic activity is production, not consumption. Productive activity no matter how bad the liquidity is will always be in front of the consumer credit as consumption isn't adding to the basket.

I hear that people don't buy due to ""low consumer confidence"" so to instill confidence... let's push prices higher. How stupid is that! People don't buy it because they don't have the money and when they get it... inflation destroys their value. If I need a pair of shoes, I go and buy them but if I don't have the money because the price is too high, I can wish it to the moon and back and I still won't get the pair of shoes.

For me and my business, I try all the time to reduce costs so I can offer my customers a lower price. No business makes their profit from higher prices but from their margin and their revenue from volume. Volume increases when people have more purchasing power to buy my stuff.

Many think that companies will be obliterated if prices go down. I wish prices will go down because my costs will go down first. Until I produce I have to finance all those costs which will be lower which in turn is easier to finance which later offers me the possibility to sell it at a lower price and gain volume.

I need prices to go down so people can buy more.

>When inflation reduces the purchasing power of money, people pay more for housing, and that means inflation increases the value of property.

Now when it comes to who benefits, no you don't benefit in real terms. Yes, your house, and land increase in paper value but if you sell, collect all that paper and go to buy a SIMILAR one... you get exactly the same amount & quality of a product/property as the one before.

What happens, in reality, is that people sell and either downgrade and buy something cheaper on paper but get either a not-so-nice area or smaller house/plot or upgrade and put that paper as a down payment on a more expensive property.  In the end, the one who wins is the lenders who take their part as the nominal amounts are bigger or the government as their share in taxes increases.

Who doesn't want prices to go down? Those businesses levered up until their neck to subdue their competition. and the government doesn't want its tax receipts to decrease.

Another classic bad economics argument is ""but, people want higher salaries"". Of course, they want it when whatever money they get, devalues until the next working day. I would want the same. As a business owner, I interact with my colleagues daily and many would gladly take a low salary raise if their purchasing power won't disappear annually.

If a business is so scared that their prices would have to go 0.5% lower yearly and their employee's cost might be 0.5% higher or 1% that's because they are having a business model with minuscule margins which in the end may show that society is better off with them going bankrupt and resources redistributed to those who can maintain a healthy margin.

Another thing I see is... ""but people's salaries will have to go lower"". No, they won't. First, my employees would gain purchasing power and second they would get raises because they are more productive so it isn't like someone would start with a $40,000 salary, and by the time they retire, their income would be still $40,000. Absolute nonsense, people get replaced in a company, and every organization has a pay structure based on skills which on average increase with age.

As people get more experience and older, they earn more and as they retire and advance someone who's younger will advance as well with their income increasing. The basket of labor costs remains the same or decreases in line over the long term with the prices but that doesn't mean that ALL SALARIES remain the same or they will be cut. Nonsense.

I feel I live in an alternate reality.

The level of confusion between machine learning, big data and causal inference is just astonishing. So let's take a look:

>Imagine a fallacious investor who, instead of investing 50% of his portfolio into stocks, and the other half — into “safe” bonds, as financial analysts suggest him, decides to undertake risks and puts 90% of his money into the stock market (let’s assume that he is a Republican with strong faith in Trump and the future of the US economy under his rule).  
>  
>When this occurs with many players, the market will experience significant distortions, with some assets being over/undervalued.

1. Portfolio allocation depends on preferences, which are inherently dynamic.
2. How would putting 90% of an agent's money in the stock market cause any distortions in the market. If we assume that the individual is a small investor, then they would be a price taker, so it would be unlikely for this individual to have any pricing power.
3. The assumption that the individual is a republican is redundant: it doesn't add to any of the analysis
4. Let's suppose that all that has been said is factually correct. How is AI supposed to solve this? That's not clear.

>In the USA, for instance, Republicans and Democrats, though seeing the same set of economic facts, perceive them differently: depending on who is in power, their views will range from pessimistic to optimistic. Of course, their misguided beliefs will lead to flawed investment decisions, hence altering the actual state of affairs by virtue of the change in asset prices.

This chain of reasoning makes absolutely no sense. How will flawed investment decisions change asset prices?  Prices of which assets? I don't understand how aggregate supply or demand is changing.

If the author was trying to make a joke, then take a bow my dawg. If by true science you mean the natural sciences, then mathematics doesn't fall under this umbrella, since maths is a formal science. If you mean to say that social scientists don't conduct experiments like physicists and chemists, then sure, economics is not a 'true science'. However that is precisely why economists try to use 'natural experiments' and some economists do conduct lab experiments (like in experimental economics), and that is because it simply is not possible to run the gold standard randomised control trial, as is done in medicine.

Since economists are heavily critiqued on the assumptions they make in their models, I would just like to point out that even physicists make idealisations. In deriving the ideal gas law, physicists talk about volumeless point particles, which they know do not exist. The interesting question is what to make of it. Of course there is no ideal gas, but that is not to say the model is not useful. In fact, it is used when dealing with nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen as a good approximation to true behaviour. No financial economist would tell you that stock prices actually follow brownian motion. Nevertheless it is a good starting point.

I think Francis Diebold does a good job of explaining the difference between econometrics and machine learning, he says:

""Machine learning (ML) is almost always centered on prediction; think ""ŷ"".   Econometrics (E) is often, but not always, centered on prediction.  Instead it's also often interested on estimation and associated inference; think ""β̂"".

Or so the story usually goes. But that misses the real distinction. *Both* ML and E as described above are centered on prediction.  The key difference is that ML focuses on non-causal prediction (if a new person ii arrives with covariates Xi, what is my minimium-MSE guess of her y\_i?), whereas the part of econometrics highlighted above focuses on causal prediction (if I intervene and give person *i* a certain treatment, what is my minimum-MSE guess of Δy\_i?).  It just happens that, assuming linearity, a ""minimum-MSE guess of Δy\_i"" is the same as a ""minimum-MSE estimate of β\_i"".

So there is a ML vs. E distinction here, but it's not ""prediction vs. estimation"" -- *it's all prediction*.  Instead, the issue is non-causal prediction vs. causal prediction. ""

However, little attention, if any, is paid to the economic impacts of unauthorized immigrants (UIs). IIRC, the National Academy of Sciences report doesn’t mention them. [Chassamboulli and Peri (2015)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094202515000514) claim there are, to date, only 2 papers which attempt to estimate the economic impacts of UI--excluding their own, so there are now 3. All are simulations. We have no direct evidence of what happens when the UI population shrinks, by force or otherwise. 

Why care? When the NAS report was posted to /r/economics awhile back by yours truly, quite a few users claimed that UIs have a different impact than authorized immigrants (AIs). They couldn’t substantiate these claims because of the aforementioned lack of evidence, but their concerns could be valid. Perhaps UIs and AIs differ by some unobserved factors. If so, assuming the labor market impacts of AIs is the same for UIs would be invalid. Further research is needed to determine whether UIs and AIs have different economic impacts.

So what would happen if the UI population in the US suddenly shrunk, let’s say via a new border wall and mass deportation? Assume the Wall can be built and would work exactly as imagined. Thus, wall + deportation would lead to a significant shrinkage of the labor force. The wall alone would cut UI inflows (we assume). Deportation would increase outflows. Since inflows have equaled outflows since 2009, we can safely assume net shrinkage of the UI population, and hence the labor force, especially the low skilled labor force since the following are [true](http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2016/09/31170303/PH_2016.09.20_Unauthorized_FINAL.pdf):

1. Mexican UIs comprise 52% of the estimated 11 million UIs currently in the US;
2. Mexican UIs are more likely to be low skilled than other UIs and natives.

Let’s start with theory. Immigration shifts both labor supply and labor demand to the right, and the overall effect on wages is ambiguous (see immigration FAQ). Ignoring labor demand shifts caused by immigration and simply concluding that immigration can only cause wage depression is called the Lump of Labor Fallacy. 

Now consider what would happen if immigrants suddenly had to leave the US labor market. Labor supply shifts left, and if only this shift occurred then wages would rise. **Supporters of the border wall and mass deportation assume only labor supply will shift left, but this is also the Lump of Labor Fallacy!** If a sizable chunk of the US labor force is forced to leave the market, 2 things will happen:

1. Goods and services markets will lose a sizable chunk of consumers;
2. Even before the shrink, employers could *expect* higher labor costs due to a future labor force shrink, and these expectations about future events would affect their hiring decisions today.

Both factors cause labor demand to shift left. Now the question of whether Wall + deportation net increases wages is an empirical one; we can’t answer it a priori. 

Back to the evidence, we don’t have it. DSGE simulations predict positive welfare effects of UI inflows on natives, even after relaxing the assumption of perfect competition.  [Chassamboulli and Peri (2015)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094202515000514) is the only simulation of the effects of *reducing* the UI population. Their model is much more sophisticated than mine and gives other channels through which UI can affect native welfare. From the abstract:

>As immigrants – especially illegal ones – have a worse outside option than natives, their wages are lower. Hence, their presence reduces the labor cost of employers who, as a consequence, create more jobs per unemployed when there are more immigrants. Because of such effects our model shows increasing deportation rates and tightening border control weakens low-skilled labor markets, increasing unemployment of native low-skilled workers. Legalization, instead, decreases the unemployment rate of low-skilled natives and increases income per native.

*****

**tl;dr + RI:** Supporters of a border wall and deportation often commit the Lump of Labor Fallacy in reverse, by assuming such policies couldn’t decrease labor demand. No direct evidence exists which could suggest the effect of reducing the unauthorized immigrant population. Simulations suggest negative welfare effects on natives, contrary to popular belief.

853,15raw2e,2023-08-15,badeconomics,"The ""Cost of Thriving Index"" is nonsense","The [Cost of Thriving Index](https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/COTI_2023_Final.pdf) (COTI) is an index put out by American Compass (and originally by the Manhattan Institute) that purports to measure

>the number of weeks a typical worker would need to work in a given year to earn enough income to cover the major costs for a family of four in the American middle class in that year: Food, Housing, Health Care, Transportation, and Higher Education.

With the index finding:

>In 1985, COTI was 39.7. Costs totaled $17,586, while median weekly income for a man aged 25 or older working full-time was $443 ($23,036 per year).  
>  
>In 2022, COTI was 62.1. Costs totaled $75,732, while median weekly income for a man aged 25 or older working full-time was $1,219 ($63,388 per year).

Most people's immediate takeaway, certainly helped by quotes from American Compass like:

>COTI’s historical data depict the catastrophic erosion of middle-class life in America.

is that the quality of life in America has declined substantially since the 1980s for the middle-class. Is this correct? Well, no, otherwise I wouldn't be writing an R1, but let's continue.

Immediate problems: the percent of your income spent on stuff has to add up to 100%, but their categories aren't an exhaustive list of stuff. It purports to be an index of ""needs"", although this is debatable as ""needs"" like utilities, clothing, and technology are left out. Coincidentally, there has been [far less inflation](https://imgur.com/9jqo1Mg) in these categories.

The cherry picking has other problems. If you tell me that someone makes more money and spent more on certain goods and services, you might just be describing normal goods. If over time, consumers, as a fraction of their income, spend less on clothing and more on healthcare, that's a sign they're \*better off\*. 

But let's ignore all that and focus instead on their methodology. From their article:

>Economists rely on inflation-based adjustments to compare costs of living over time, but this method measures the cost of buying the same set of things in different eras. Perhaps a family could more easily afford a 1985 quality of life in 2015 than in 1985, but being in the middle class in 2015 means affording a 2015 quality of life.

A brief technical note, that's **not** what inflation-based adjustments try to do. What COTI thinks they do is **hold fixed a basket of goods**, but really it's trying to **hold fixed utility and adjust the basket**, which is why we change the weights on what people spend over time and the contents of the basket.

Anyways, there's a normative claim in here that I mostly agree with: it's fine to have a relative standard of living because we should expect to progress as a society. People, including myself, have made a similar argument for why relative poverty thresholds are useful -- almost no one is poor by a 1930's American standard of living, but given how much economic growth we've had since then I think it's fine to move the threshold for poverty up over time.

I would never say that we're worse off than we were 40 years ago, but if you want to make the argument that we could be doing better given the amount of growth we've had, by all means make that argument.

Unfortunately, they do a lot of rhetorical tricks throughout their brief that conflate ""we should have increasing expectations for prosperity"" and ""workers today are worse off than they were"". Saying things like:

>COTI’s historical data depict the catastrophic erosion of middle-class life in America.

and

>...It is indisputable that the set used in COTI is one that a middle-class family could afford a generation ago on one income and cannot afford any longer

By their own admission, this isn't true. 

>When inflation-adjusted figures report that a 2022 earner could afford roughly what a 1985 earner could, that assumes the 2022 earner still plans to drive a 1985 car, live in a 1985 house, watch a 1985 television, and receive 1985 medical care. 

A 2023 family could buy a 1985 consumption bundle and have plenty of room to spare; that we should aim or standards higher is an argument that we *could* be doing better not that we *are* doing worse. 

Normative claims aside, let's get to what we're all here for: pointing and laughing at their methodology. Category by category:

>**Food:** COTI uses the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s “Official Food Plans,” taking the average of its “Low-Cost” plan (which USDA defines as falling within the second quartile of food expenditures) and “Moderate-Cost” plan (third quartile) as an estimate of the median cost of a nutritious diet for a family of four, a standard that it updates over time. In 1985, this cost was $4,550. In 2022, this cost was $13,667.

and

>**Transportation:** COTI uses the U.S. Department of Transportation’s estimate (derived from the American Automobile Association) for total cost of ownership for a vehicle driven 15,000 miles per year. In 1985, this cost was $3,484. In 2022, this cost was $10,729.

Food and transportation I'm lumping together because they have the same obvious issue: no quality adjustments. A 1985 car was a piece of junk compared to what you can buy today so it makes sense that a current one costs more (in nominal dollars). Even today you can buy like a 2008 Corolla for less than what a 1985 Chevy Cavalier originally retailed for, and the Corolla will wipe the floor with the Chevy in every way.

This goes back to the difference between ""Almost 40 years later we *should* have better cars"" (sure, fine) and ""we are doing worse than we were earlier"" (no, very bad).

There's also a funny note that the American Enterprise Institute ([AEI) points out](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/the-cost-of-thriving-has-fallen-correcting-and-rejecting-the-american-compass-cost-of-thriving-index/), which is that the Department of Ag. updates the food index using the CPI, which is the exact thing COTI purports to hate!

&#x200B;

>**Housing:** COTI uses the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s “Fair Market Rent” (estimated at a local market’s 40th percentile as of 1995 and at the 45th percentile in earlier years) for a three-bedroom unit in the Raleigh, North Carolina MSA, where rents approximate the national median. In 1985, this cost was $5,560. In 2022, this cost was $18,204.

As three bedroom rentals in Raleigh go, so does the nation. Why they did this I have no idea. it's also unclear if Raleigh being representative means Raleigh is representative *now* or if it was representative *40 years ago* or both. Regardless, this is an insane amount of faith to put into one segment (three bedroom units) of one housing market (Raleigh) to be representative for 40 years. This index also has the same quality adjustments that plague the other ones, specifically for Raleigh since a larger share of the housing inventory is new and newer housing is higher quality and because Raleigh-Durham was a much rougher place in the 1980s.

&#x200B;

>**Health Care:** COTI uses the Kaiser Family Foundation’s estimate of the average premium for a family health insurance plan offered through a large employer. In 1985, this cost was $2,152. In 2022, this cost was $22,463. Note that data for imputing historical costs are available only from 1987 and the 2020 COTI therefore used the 1987 value in both 1985 and 1986, implying no cost growth in those years and thus overestimating the 1985 cost. The 2023 COTI estimates the 1985 cost as the midpoint between the 1987 cost and an estimate derived by extending backward from 1987 the average 1987–90 growth rate.

&#x200B;

This one is just flagrantly wrong. Those numbers come from counting both the employee and employer costs and subtracting those from income -- but this is double counting! The employee doesn't pay the employer's cost except through a reduction in wages, which is already accounted for by using nominal wage data. From the [AEI](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/the-cost-of-thriving-has-fallen-correcting-and-rejecting-the-american-compass-cost-of-thriving-index/) article doing the same debunking as me:

&#x200B;

>Take the 2022 data as an example. The baseline COTI calculation includes $22,463 for health insurance, which is subtracted from the family’s income of $63,388. However, Cass’s source data show that employees paid only 29 percent of the premium, or $6,514. In terms of the COTI “weeks of work” calculation, correcting these data reduces the number of weeks from 18.4 to 5.3. This 13-week reduction is over half the total decline between 1985 and 2022. (The full decline is 22.4 weeks.)

&#x200B;

So before we do anything regarding the fact that US healthcare is a million times better than what it was in 1985, the index is overstating healthcare costs by like 250%. Technically, this overstatement applies equally to 1985 as it does to 2023, so it shouldn't affect relative changes too much, but it's clearly very wrong. There's also the issue that this is **mean costs** compared to **median wages**. 

&#x200B;

>**Education:** COTI uses the U.S. Department of Education’s estimate for the total in-state cost (tuition, fees, room, and board) of attending a public, four-year college. This total is divided by two to estimate an annual amount that a family would need to save over eight years to put one child through college and thus over 16 years to put two children through college. In 1985, this cost was $1,841. In 2022, this cost was $10,669. (Note that the Department of Education has not yet released 2022 data, so 2021 data are used for 2022.)

This one is wrong because it uses *sticker price* and not what families actually pay; a lot of the increase in tuition is price discrimination against wealthier households. It's also again doing **median wages** vs **mean costs** and ignoring that most people don't send their kids to college -- even less so in 1985.

&#x200B;

>**Income:** COTI uses data from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Current Population Survey (CPS), which reports median full-time weekly earnings for men over the age of 25. In 1985, this wage was $443. In 2022, this wage was $1,219. **Authors Note: they do this same definition but with other groups, e.g. women, high school grads, etc.**

This should be after taxes to account for the fact that average [federal tax rates have gone down](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/historical-average-federal-tax-rates-all-households) for basically every part of the income distribution. Per [AEI](https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Cost-of-Thriving-Has-Fallen.pdf?x91208) (p. 18, citing another AEI pub), median and mean state tax rates have been basically unchanged in the past 40 years.

You fix all of this and you basically get back to using what Cass was critiquing -- some measure of real income, which has unambiguously gone up for the vast majority of households. Worth noting that, if anything, conventional (CPI) inflation adjusted measures *understate* income because the CPI *overstates* inflation. And that wages (and incomes) hides all the non-wage benefits that have become increasingly generous, with employee sponsored healthcare being the main one.",flavorless_beef,t2_6g7e1abu,0.94,140,82

So a few years ago, Reason made [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w1DeNrZYLE) about five common arguments against immigration and why they are wrong. Unsurprisingly, the video did not have a great reception.

About seven months later, a conservative Youtuber by the name of ""Don't Walk, Run! Productions"" posted [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_b9nC3Sxo) that attempted to debunk Reason's debunking. I will now be debunking this video, so I'm essentially doing an R1 of an R1 of an R1.

————————————————————————————————————————————————

**Reason's argument #1:** Immigrants are not stealing jobs, in contrary to what Trump says. They also allow for more job creation due to employers having more money to spend on productive use.

**DWDR's counter:** Trump was talking about illegal immigrants, and these immigrants make up a substantial portion of the workforce in sectors like agriculture and construction. Illegal immigrants lower wages substantially without lowering prices that much, so they are merely being exploited without doing much for the American economy. And they wouldn't create jobs as Reason argues because they would just spend the money on more illegal immigrants.

**My counter:**

>Trump was talking about illegal immigrants

Not that relevant tbh in terms of labor market impact, I don't know why so many nativists make this point.

>immigrants make up a substantial portion of the workforce in sectors like agriculture and construction.

Irrelevant unless you adhere to the lump of labour fallacy and believe that there is a [fixed number of jobs](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) that can't be influenced by immigrants, which isn't true. Immigrants can create jobs through [higher consumer spending](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927537108000316), for example. For certain workers like [high school dropouts](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration), low-skilled immigration does cause lower labor market outcomes, but you shouldn't expect lower overall wages in the long run.

>Illegal immigrants lower wages substantially without lowering prices that much, so they are merely being exploited without doing much for the American economy.

First of all, if DWDR is so concerned with the low wages and exploitation of illegal immigrants, then he should support the [legalization](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/339616) of such immigrants. Sending illegal immigrants back to their origin countries would not help them at all, considering that they literally left those countries to seek better wages.

For his take on prices, it is true that the price impact of illegal immigration has been [overstated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_illegal_immigrants_in_the_United_States#Price_levels), so he does make somewhat of a fair point.

But he also implies that the lack of illegal immigrants would raise wages and employment among remaining workers, using [an article from the Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/low-paid-illegal-work-force-has-little-impact-on-prices/) as a source indirectly. But we have a real-world example of this theory being tested—an [article from the AER](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/aer.20170765) found that immigration restrictions which shrank the Bracero program in the agricultural sector merely led to greater mechanization instead of higher labor market outcomes for native workers. Yes, these were not necessarily illegal immigrants, but there is no reason why mechanization would not occur in such a scenario.

>And they wouldn't create jobs as Reason argues because they would just spend the money on more illegal immigrants.

Not a great argument on Reason's part, but there are additional reasons why more immigration doesn't necessarily lead to lower overall native outcomes, such as a [higher return on](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2017/how-immigration-affects-workers-two-wrong-models-right-one) [capital investment](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jkennan/research/OpenBorders.pdf) and [task specialization](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.1.3.135). Note that these apply in the long run only.

————————————————————————————————————————————————

**Reason's argument #2**: Most legal immigrants and all illegal immigrants are not allowed to receive most forms of welfare. They really only benefit from emergency medical services, as well as K-12 education. Non-citizens use welfare at lower rates than native citizens. They also have a higher labor market participation rate.

**DWDR's counter:** 51% of legal and illegal immigrants use at least one welfare program. EMS for illegal immigrants costs $2 billion. As for K-12, there are 65,000 undocumented high school graduates, and since $13,119 are spent per public school student, this leads to around $11.1 billion being spent on undocumented students. And once you account for their children born in the United States, the total cost is actually $66.7 billion. Illegal non-citizens shouldn't be using welfare at all, and illegal immigrants are stealing your jobs because of their higher labor market participation rate.

**My counter:**

>51% of legal and illegal immigrants use at least one welfare program.

This statistic does not contradict Reason's point, as they did not say that immigrants do not use welfare at all.

>EMS for illegal immigrants costs $2 billion.

Technically not bad economics, as it depends on whether or not you believe illegal immigrants should have access to EMS or other basic services, but barring immigrants from such services would probably limit integration/assimilation.

>As for K-12, there are 65,000 undocumented high school graduates, and since $13,119 are spent per public school student, this leads to around $11.1 billion being spent on undocumented students.

I mean, assuming you want undocumented immigrants to integrate into American society properly, barring them from public education would be the last thing you would want to do. Also, [the U.S Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyler_v._Doe#Summary) ruled that these immigrants have the right to a K-12 public education.

The numbers themselves are also poorly used, as illegal immigrants probably receive less than the average student due to their [poorer socioeconomic background](https://econofact.org/what-explains-the-wages-of-undocumented-workers). And he fails to mention the future benefits from [greater human capital](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20180352).

>And once you account for their children born in the United States, the total cost is actually $66.7 billion.

Again, technically not bad economics, but they are citizens, so they shouldn't be treated any differently just for being the children of illegal immigrants.

>Non-citizens shouldn't be using welfare at all

Not really, they can [still use](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/edb17.pdf) certain welfare programs under certain conditions.

>illegal immigrants are stealing your jobs because of their higher labor market participation rate.

Again with the lump of labour fallacy.

————————————————————————————————————————————————

**Reason's argument #3**: Illegal immigrants pay $11.7 billion in state/local taxes, with $1.1 billion coming from income taxes.

**DWDR's counter:** Only 4.4 million illegal immigrants file income taxes, meaning that each of those illegal immigrants pays a measly $250 of income tax on average.

**My counter:** I find it weird that DWDR only includes income tax in his calculation, but regardless it is true that illegal immigrants themselves do not contribute that much in fiscal revenue to state/local governments. However, future generations actually have a [net fiscal impact](https://www.nap.edu/read/23550/chapter/14#541) on state/local budgets.

————————————————————————————————————————————————

**Reason's argument #4**: It's stupid to suggest that illegal immigrants should just wait in line, considering that very few visas were actually given to a very large waiting list. Uses Mexico as an example (65,000 visas given to 1.4 million Mexicans on the waitlist). And on average, people have to wait 15-25 years to enter the United States.

**DWDR's counter:** It's dumb to focus on Mexico, we should focus on all countries. In 2016, 4.56 million people wanted to immigrate to the United States, and 618,078 people arrived, meaning that 13% of people on the list get in. Also, getting into the United States should not be quick because being in America should be a privilege.

**My counter:**

>It's dumb to focus on Mexico, we should focus on all countries. In 2016, 4.56 million people wanted to immigrate to the United States, and 618,078 people arrived, meaning that 13% of people on the list get in.

How long the waiting process is depends on the type of immigrant.

[What Part of Legal Immigration Don't You Understand?](https://i.imgur.com/RJV0Bf4.jpg)

>Also, getting into the United States should not be quick because being in America should be a privilege.

By acknowledging that the immigration process does take a long time, he kind of contradicts his previous point. But anyways, this is a moral/normative take, so I can't really R1 it.

————————————————————————————————————————————————

**Reason's argument #5**: Hispanic immigrants are learning English at higher rates than previous immigration waves.

**DWDR's counter:** Mentions that the background footage is of Lauren Southern, who is arguing against immigration into Canada, meaning that it is not relevant. Argues that immigrants are not integrating because only 25% of Hispanic adults speak only English, citing a Pew Research Center report.

**My counter:**

>Mentions that the background footage is of Lauren Southern, who is arguing against immigration into Canada, meaning that it is not relevant.

Nick Gillespie and Reason's arguments do not apply to just America...

>Argues that immigrants are not integrating because only 25% of Hispanic adults speak mainly English, citing a Pew Research Center report.

First of all, an immigrant mainly speaking a certain language doesn't necessarily mean that they are unable to speak other languages.

Also, Nick Gillespie said that Hispanic immigrants were *learning* English at faster rates than previous immigrants. He did not say anything about their *current* knowledge of English. In fact, the Pew Research Center report DWDR literally shows that future generations of Hispanic immigrants begin to use more English, which is in line with other empirical evidence such as [a report from the National Academies](https://www.nap.edu/read/21746/chapter/9#332).

>*Although language diversity among immigrants has increased even as Spanish has become the dominant immigrant language, the available evidence indicates that today’s immigrants are learning English at the same rate or faster than earlier immigrant waves.*

855,8crag0,2018-04-16,badeconomics,The Declaration of peasant economics.,"Did you ever thought: Man, if we would decrease the output of an economy, everyone would be more prosperous.

No?

Well, it looks like the [International Congress on Peasant Rights](http://www.global-peasants-rights.com/index.php/en/about-us/congress-2) did.

So what did they do? 
The created a [draft](http://www.global-peasants-rights.com/images/Dokumente/2017_03_06_UN_Draft_E.pdf) declaration on the rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas.

The first thing I found rather suspicious, is the tremendous amount of duplication of other declarations, just with ""people"" and ""human"" swapped out for ""peasants"". 
I'll only give one example since this aspect is not the reason why this is BE, but you will find a lot of aspects (right to work, right to organize in unions, biological diversity, etc.), which are already covered for example by the declaration of human rights, the convention on biological diversity or the convention for the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage.

Article 6, first paragraph
>Peasants and other people working in rural areas have the right to life, physical and 
mental integrity, liberty and security of person. 

Now for the BE Part:
Article 13, second paragraph

>States  shall  create  an  enabling  environment  with  opportunities  for  work  and  that 
provides  remuneration  allowing  for  an  adequate  standard  of  living  for  peasants  and  other 
people  working  in  rural  areas  and  their  families.  In  States  facing  high  levels  of  rural 
poverty  and  in  the  absence  of  employment  opportunities  in  other  sectors,  States  shall  take 
appropriate  measures  to  establish  and  promote  food  systems  that  are  sufficiently  labour-
intensive to contribute to the creation of employment. 

Ok, so let me get this right: We have a country with a high level of rural poverty and no employment opportunities. 
And the way we do this is by reducing the productivity of the individual worker? This even contradicts with their own position:

>Peasants  and  other  people  working  in  rural  areas  have  the  right  to  work,  which 
includes the right to choose freely the way they earn their living. 

Artikel 13, first paragraph

Unfortunately, they couldn't wrap their hand around the concept of productivity being a major factor for the income. 
Remember, we are still dealing with independent, small scale farmers. Consider the following situation:

We have a small scale Farm, one of which this whole fuzz is about. The family uses the most modern equipment it has (which is not very modern, but better than working their fields with spoons)
to work on their land. Both is not much, but it is barely enough to survive.
But it is not enough to let their children go to the nearest school for example. So one could consider them poor, since the draft does not give us an exact definition (but using the definition of extreme poverty wouldn't make any difference in this example) . If we would implement this proposal and force the family to use inferior tools, they would starve, or at least be significantly worse of. Funnily enough, this would result in the state requiring the farmer to use even less productive means of productions.

Considering this, the following article sounds like satire:

Article 15, first paragraph

>Peasants and other people working in rural areas have the right to adequate food and 
the  fundamental  right  to  be  free  from  hunger. This  includes  the  right  to  produce  food  and 
the  right  to  adequate  nutrition,  which  guarantee  the  possibility  of  enjoying  the  highest 
degree of physical, emotional and intellectual development. 

Now for some extra BE candid:

Article 19, 4th paragraph
>States  shall  ensure  that  seeds  of  sufficient  quality  and  quantity  are  available  to 
peasants at the most suitable time for planting, and at an affordable price. 

It is always a good idea for a state to directly control prices. Especially when it comes to goods with literally thousands of variations. \s

But then everything in the game is charged for - any upgrades, equipment, even virtual land.  And one of the big costs is travel.  So to get around this virtual universe, you need to pay to transport.  Yet, its free to access the virtual universe.  Weird pricing scheme... I see the goal is to try and allow access to the educational parts to poor but also amass revenues from others.  Why not just price discriminate in some other way?  

An evil company wants to win the prize in order to find the ""egg"" and make profitable changes to the world - upgrades, charge for use, ??.  But that's terrible, right?  Because its better that the current owners are simply nickel and diming everyone for travel and avatar upgrades. 

But why don't they just buy the company??  Rather, they are wasting a fortune just trying to find the egg.  All rent seeking.  And given the amount of effort going into finding the egg, why the hell did the supposedly ""benevolent"" creator of the system encourage this rent seeking??  If he really wanted to do good, why didn't he just make the virtual world free for all?  Is there a reason that any resources in the virtual world are made artificially scarce?  Wouldn't a fixed fee be far more efficient than charging a price on every item in the virtual world?  These people clearly don't know about the efficiency of a fixed fee (or two-part tariff when MC=0).

Finally, one of the players wants to win the egg for nobel reasons.  She wants to use the fortune to help end the world crisis.  HOW??  Who knows?  Having lots of money means you can solve the worlds problems, of course.  This completely ignores the fact that the lack of energy isn't the result of people not having enough money, but rather that THERE ISN""T ENOUGH ENERGY!  

Anyway... just venting on a book I actually do like.  Just the economics is a big part of the future world the author has created and its full of some leaps of reasoning surrounding the world economy, prices, and how winning a fortune can save the world.",urnbabyurn,t2_4y3n2,0.83,16,20

R1:

Selection bias is a thing, and is a critique you can level at most economics papers.

The exception is randomized trials (and IVs and RDs on their good days). Because the treatment is assigned randomly, there is no selection bias (Esther Duflo has made the job of conference discussants much harder! Now people have to read papers before they critique them.)

But a little thing like that doesn't stop /r/economics!

Instead people decide to insist that an experimental paper is flawed because of ""selection bias"". Why? It's not clear. It's possible that the experiment design confused them (the main result is an interaction between assignment to treatment and poverty). 

My theory is that they don't know that selection bias is, an actual, real concept, and not a nice catch-all critique you can throw at papers you don't like.

We can do better than that - and you don't need any stats knowledge to do so. Just consult [the chart](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/12/how-to-argue-with-research-you-dont-like/).

Observe:

""Do you like the conclusion implied by the research?"" ""No.""

""Is the research based on an experiment?"" ""Yes.""

""Was the random trial conducted locally or nationally?"" ""Nationally (technically internationally with two local populations).""

""Is the result positive (""it works!"") or negative(""no effect"")? ""Positive"".

**While the policy shows promise, we don't know if it scalable going forward**.

Was that so hard?

The highlight of the linked thread is when it was suggested that a better experiment would be to ""similarly-earning people, measure their ""financial cognition"" then see how earnings change over time."". Which would have an *actual* selection bias.

859,jd3p0l,2020-10-17,badeconomics,Axios - America's True Unemployment Rate Has Recovered to 2016 Levels,"[Axios](https://www.axios.com/americas-true-unemployment-rate-6e34decb-c274-4feb-a4af-ffac8cf5840d.html?fbclid=IwAR2e2O8f99JtvH4aPKcs31ZOzFId3uXNB3V9We0mnKixyAutzUGrTjwdiRk) has an exclusive new story out about how America’s true unemployment rate is shockingly 3x as high as the current official unemployment measure. Let’s take a look at how they get there:

> A person who is looking for a full-time job that pays a living wage — but who can't find one — is unemployed. If you accept that definition, the true unemployment rate in the U.S. is a stunning 26.1%, according to an important new dataset shared exclusively with ""Axios on HBO.""

Ah, okay. I can accept taking umbrage with measures of unemployment not capturing the true extent of hardship faced by American workers. So if you think you have a metric that does a better job of capturing that and feel like calling it unemployment, more power to you I guess.

> Why it matters: The official unemployment rate is artificially depressed by excluding people who might be earning only a few dollars a week. It also excludes anybody who has stopped looking for work or is discouraged by a lack of jobs or by the demands of child care during the coronavirus crisis.

This is conceivably true. However, there are also several official metrics of unemployment that arguably do a better job of measuring such things than the standard unemployment metric, [which is U-3](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE). There is a nuanced balance to be had here, because you don’t want to be including people in your rate’s base that have no interest in being in the labor force. By that, I mean people like students, the disabled, and stay-at-home parents prior to COVID’s arrival. Some may be interested in working, but even for many among those certainly not full-time.

> If you measure the unemployed as anybody over 16 years old who isn't earning a living wage, the rate rises even further, to 54.6%. For Black Americans, it's 59.2%.

We’re starting to go off the rails here a bit. I guess that could be true if you defined unemployment that way, but why would you expect any 16-year-old to be able to earn a living wage (whatever it’s defined as)? There are also about 30 millions Americans that are age 70 or older that have long retired, why would you expect them to be employed?

> The backstory: The official definition of unemployment can be traced back to the 1870s, when a Massachusetts statistician named Carroll Wright diagnosed what he referred to as ""industrial hypochondria"".
By restricting the ""unemployed"" label to men who “really want employment,” Wright managed to minimize the unemployment figure.
Wright went on to found the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and he brought his unemployment definition with him.
To this day, to be officially counted as unemployed you need to be earning no money at all, and you need to be actively looking for work.

That’s the first I’ve heard about Carroll Wright in my life and I have no idea to the extent those history tidbits are true. That being said, I’d like to zero in on that final bullet point. It’s true that U-3 only accounts for fully unemployed people that are seeking a job (I wouldn’t say they are earning no money either since most will be receiving unemployment insurance, but that’s an aside). However, there are many alternative official forms of unemployment one can use that take a more expansive view of what constitutes being unemployed.

For example, another one of the [most common official measures is U-6](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE?fbclid=IwAR10LL2oZ7Cy_OwqcL6uYIFMxUF19oKcWpFlbqciNnLCB1ZUa4pxbNgAimU), which [broadly speaking](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm) is supposed to represent an upper bound of any American marginally attached to the labor force. That means it includes anyone that sought a job in the past year and left the labor force discouraged, those working part-time that would like to work full-time, the underemployed that are working jobs beneath their skill level, and more - including parents that stopped looking for work because they left the labor force to look after their children during the pandemic.

> By the numbers: In January, when the official rate of unemployment was 3.6%, the true rate was seven times greater — 23.4%. That's according to new calculations from the [Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity](https://www.lisep.org/), founded by Gene Ludwig, a former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency.

Alright, now we are really fucking getting goofy. If you want to take a look at the Ludwig Institute’s figures to see how they are deriving these totals, you can go to their website and [download their full methodology here](https://assets.website-files.com/5f67c16a6ca3251ecc11eca7/5f84cf8d3fbecf746ac890a4_Methodology%20for%20the%20LISEP%20OCT13.pdf). I’m instead just going to highlight what I think is the most important passage that highlights how they derived what constitutes a living wage:

> To be employed for the purposes of LISEP’s true employment concept, an individual must either have a full-time job (35+ hours per week) or have a part-time job but no desire to be full-time (e.g., students). The second stipulation is that an individual must earn at least $20,000 annually. This annual wage is adjusted for inflation, calculated in January 2020 dollars. ($20,000 was chosen because LISEP concluded that anything beneath that wage could fairly be considered a poverty wage, based on the U.S. poverty guidelines put out by the Department of Health and Human Services, which considers a three-person household to be in poverty if it has an income of less than $20,000 per year).

So, an INDIVIDUAL that is earning less than $20k is unemployed, because that is less than the poverty threshold for a THREE-PERSON HOUSEHOLD. I find that particularly problematic for many reasons, including [because a majority of Americans that are age 18-29 are still living with their parents](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/04/a-majority-of-young-adults-in-the-u-s-live-with-their-parents-for-the-first-time-since-the-great-depression/). Many are living quite reasonably well and often as full-time students. Not to mention that $20k constitutes very different standards of living in rural Alabama than it does in downtown San Francisco. To me a far more reasonable metric would be something like say, 50% of the local median wage.

Regardless, how well does their “true unemployment” metric hold up as some sort of composite measure of wages and unemployment over time?

[Yikes.](https://imgur.com/g08kg9h)

Well look at that. It turns out that the True Unemployment rate has recovered all the way to 2016 levels. I guess pack it all up boys, no need for expanding the pandemic UI or more stimulus because this economy is back to booming baby.

That is honestly so fucking stupid and reflects such a disconnect with reality that I hope literally everyone who is not employed by Axios or the Ludwig Institute can self-evidently see it's not true. I would have hoped that alone would have caused major alarm bells to go off that their metric is not doing a good job of capturing whatever the hell it is they are intending to measure, but alas, we evidently do not live in such a world. 

Whatever your complaints are about U-3, U-6 or other similar official statistics like the Labor Force Participation rate, at least none of them show such absurdities.

862,qwnrd4,2021-11-18,badeconomics,Gas prices and presidential approval ratings are perfectly correlated,"In [this](https://twitter.com/ColinJMcAuliffe/status/1461050556085059588?t=EZl14nz-WNAXMGutGBrTew&s=19) twitter post by an organization called ""Data for progress"" a univariate linear regression was used to model the relationship between gas prices and presidential approval ratings. The authors used approval ratings at level (Y) and a weekly average of gas prices (x). They found a R\^2 / correlation of around 0.96 / 96%, which is extremely high for an empirical regression. This R1 will focus on the econometrics of the claim, rather than the veracity of the claim itself.

**What's wrong with the model?**

For the vast majority of models in time series econometrics, a requirement for the model to be unbiased / consistent is for the data to be **stationary**. Put simply, this means that observations are converted into log difference or into a % change instead of using it as is. This is because when we examine things like asset prices, macro or micro economic variables or anything that grows over time, there is a natural upward trend in the movement of these variables. This causes 'false' correlation with the associated data points, biasing inferential statistics and making your model biased.

With this information, we can say that the model used was biased because:

* Contemporaneous correlation: A weekly average of oil prices is not stationary, so a natural upward trend in the price of the asset is in the data, which means that the R\^2 of 0.96 he got is wrong and the correlation he establishes is highly biased.
* Volatility clustering in asset prices that see 'jumps' tend to be quite strong. Clustering makes the effects of price jumps and serial correlation more pronounced, making the lack of consideration of auto correlation even worse in his regression.
* Weekly frequency when dealing with gas prices don't reflect the nature of how gas prices behave (they are volatile and are typically examined at higher frequencies)
* It's also a single variable regression, so there are several omitted variables (ie the regression is way too simplistic)

**So the model is biased. What does the same model look like with unbiased data?**

I first began by replicating the study with the same underlying data as the model used in the twitter post. I used DHHNGSP (fred) for gas prices. For approval ratings, I used [all voter approval ratings for Biden from fivethirtyeight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/). Both are at a daily frequency, beginning in late January until yesterday.

When replicating the regression I used first differenced / % change gas prices at the daily frequency instead of a weekly average (Data was stationary after first order differencing with 2 different unit root tests) . For the dependent variable, I used log differenced daily approval ratings. This assumes the following specification:

    Approval% = Gas_price%*β + ε

After running a robust SE regression with % change gas prices on approval ratings, we see an abysmally low R\^2 of [0.0007](https://imgur.com/a/ZUwNMKI), which is about as far away as you can get from the R\^2 of 0.96 that the authors estimated. For comparison, here's the scatter plot with the [non stationary data](https://imgur.com/a/6ZgbyiO) from the original twitter link, and here's the scatter plot with [stationary data](https://imgur.com/a/h7ACmVI).

As you can probably tell from the two graphs, the difference in the modelled relationship strikingly different and when the data is unbiased.

**A simple linear regression doesn't work in this case. What other models should I use?**

Because time dependency is important for the reasons mentioned above, we would most likely use an **Autoregressive process, Error correction model or a Vector Auto Regression**. These models formally account for the serial correlation in the data, which means that the estimates would be more robust than ones derived from a linear regression. Because we're interested in examining the granular details of the relationship between the two, I use a VAR process to model for these variables .

**VAR specification**

Through lag optimization, we settle with a VAR(1) process. (AIC and FPE gave 4 lags, but HQIC and SIC gave 1 lag). Because we assume volatility clusters strongly with gas prices and have a strong preference towards less noise, I settle with 1 lag. This follows the following generalized specification:

    k_{t } =  A_{0}+ A_1k_{t-1} +......A_nk_{t-n} + e_{t}
    A_{t } =  k_{0}+ k_1A_{t-1} +......k_nA_{t-n} + e_{t}

Though the VAR model has quite a few inferential statistics, we're only interested in the impulse response functions between the variables. This is the irf with [Approval as Y and Gas prices as X](https://imgur.com/a/JXFKUsa) and this is the irf which is [vice versa.](https://imgur.com/a/ik2xeMb)

We can observe persistent change in the impulse responsiveness between the two variables past the observed time horizon in the initial regressions, (we only examine up to 12 days because of exponential decay). This clearly shows that time dependency needs to be accounted for in this specific relationship.

For people that are familiar with the VAR model, these are the [tests for structural breaks](https://imgur.com/a/rqOAL9o) and [Cholesky decomposition](https://imgur.com/a/eUMTqUr).

**Key takeaways:**

* The graphs that the twitter dudes posted wouldn't pass in an introductory econometrics course.
* Simple fixes would be to add more variables to RHS and to make sure your data is stationary
* A more sophisticated fix would be to use a model that formally models for autocorrelation
* R\^2 tends to be low empirically and shouldn't really be the focal point of your inferential statistics
* Never assume causality from a model: Especially if your model is a 1 variable linear regression

EDIT:

A few changes proposed by u/db1923 have been made for the initial regression.

I initially used level Approval ratings because at log difference, the adf statistics showed even worse spurious correlation than the initial level data, along with reversing the correlation. This was even more pronounced at the second difference, where each observation was so close to zero it was unusable

[This](https://imgur.com/a/h7ACmVI) is the new scatter plot with % change in approval ratings on % change of gas prices. When doing this, the R\^2 decreased from 0.003 to [0.0007](https://imgur.com/a/ZUwNMKI). I didn't think it could get any worse, but there we go.

    Approval% = Gas_price%*β + ε

As for the VAR model, the AR structure already deals with the unit root, so it's fine as is.

What we can take away from these changes is that this regression should never have happened in the first place.

863,16bq7w7,2023-09-06,badeconomics,"No, employers did not hand out 7+ percent raises at the start of the pandemic","This was originally just a comment in the fiat thread, but it was suggested I make it a short post so here it is.

Relevant [tweet is here](https://twitter.com/AltmanEcon/status/1698833933197074731), courtesy of Daniel Altman, chief economist at Instawork:

>Yes, real wages are 1% higher than they were before the pandemic.
  
>But real wages rose by much more early in the pandemic – they had to, since working was riskier and labor was in shorter supply – and then they declined for TWO WHOLE YEARS.
  
>That's why people were/are miserable.

He then posts a chart showing a massive spike in average hourly earnings at the beginning of the pandemic. His claims are false.
  

  
The problem is a change in composition—a lot of low-wage workers lost their jobs (just look at the [employment ratio](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EMRATIO)—it drops a full ten percent at the start of the pandemic), so they dropped out of the calculation. Average goes up, but it's not like employers handed out a 7% real raise to the workers that were left.
  

  
To see this, you can look at the [Atlanta Fed Wage Growth Tracker](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker). The advantage of this tool is that it tracks wage changes in the same individual, thus solving the composition issue. Nominal wage gains were essentially flat at the start of the pandemic, and this is true for both low and high wage levels.

[As u/Integralds points out, the COVID-induced deflation [seen here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL#0) also played some role in the jump.]
  

  
The same issue goes for the long drop that Altman highlights. It was a mixture of real declines (due to sticky nominal wages and increasing inflation) and composition effects (low-wage workers coming back to the labor force, thus dragging the average back down).

864,c6qlku,2019-06-29,badeconomics,Horrifically bad economics in the iCarly fandom,"Some background: in season 2, episode 8 of iCarly, Freddie Benson and Sam Puckett shared their first kiss, as the two had never kissed anyone previously. This kiss remained a secret, until in season 3, episode 1, Sam told her best friend, Carly, that she kissed Freddie. This angers Carly, resulting in Carly interrogating both Sam and Freddie throughout the episode, and forcing them to promise to never keep secrets from her again.

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nicegirls/comments/ba5v2o/we_forget_carly_was_the_real_nice_girl_sometimes) asserts that Carly was, in fact, jealous that Sam and Freddie kissed. However, some commenters are quick to state that Carly was not jealous, and simply got angry because Sam and Freddie had kept a secret from her. This latter opinion is bad economics.

First, consider the fact that Freddie had a known crush on Carly for a very long time prior to his kissing Sam. Carly always rejected his advances, but he was always there for her, should she ever reciprocate his feelings. This allows us to construct an intertemporal model of choice. Using [McCall 1970](https://educnet.enpc.fr/pluginfile.php/29349/mod_resource/content/1/Mc%20Call_1970.pdf), we can construct a Bellman equation where the choice variable is whether or not Carly reciprocates a suitor's feelings. 

Let V_s be the value of being single and V_r be the value of being in a relationship. Assume that a suitor appears in every period where Carly is single, and the suitor's desirability is IID. In her state of being single, Carly gets a ""utility from singlehood"" in each period, which we'll define as S. She is also free to receive suitor advances in the future, as long as she remains single.

If Carly reciprocates, she receives a ""utility from being in a relationship"" in each period, which is the same as the suitor's desirability. We'll define this as R. With probability p, she will break up with the suitor in each period, at which point she will return to being single. With probability (1-p), the relationship will last. If Carly does not reciprocate, she will receive a suitor in the next period. Her utility of being in a relationship from this suitor is R'.

Bearing in mind that the future is discounted, [these are the relevant Bellman equations](https://imgur.com/a/oRYUwbE).

The reason Carly did not accept Freddie's advances is because she has a reservation desirability, which Freddie did not meet. She will accept a suitor whose desirability is above her reservation, and reject anyone whose desirability is below her reservation.

Now, Carly finds out that Freddie kissed Sam, and is quite possibly developing feelings for her. This adds an entirely new dimension to her optimization problem, as now *Freddie is no longer guaranteed to court her in every period*. In other words, she no longer has a guaranteed suitor in every period. With probability p*, she will have no suitor, i.e. she faces no R' value. As such, [these are now the relevant Bellman equations](https://imgur.com/a/xfGCNwo).

Given this, it is clear that Carly was most certainly jealous that Sam and Freddie had kissed. The value from her choosing not to reciprocate had plummeted, and as a result, the difference between the value gained from not reciprocating and reciprocating with Freddie had shrunk, and perhaps reciprocation now yielded more value.

If you don't like McCall's framework, perhaps you'll prefer [the Huggett 1993 framework](http://econ.ucsb.edu/~mkapicka/RG/Huggett.pdf). Let Carly be a representative agent who wants to maximize utility over her entire life, where the variable acting as the maximizer is an index of social activities, and utility is given form as a power function. She is given a ""shadow endowment"" in each period that enables her to engage in social activities. However, each period can also be one of two states: good or bad. In the good state, she socializes as normal. However, in the bad state, she needs to be in a relationship to socialize well (e.g. say she and two other friends want to go out, but those two are in a relationship, leading to her possibly getting third-wheeled). She controls for these states with securities. The relevant security for the good state is a risky security of a suitor who meets her reservation desirability level. She may or may not receive such a suitor, but all is fine since this is a good state. The relevant security for the bad state was the risk-free Freddie. However, with Freddie potentially gaining feelings for Sam, he, too, becomes a risky security.

To solve the Huggett model, we create an asset grid and endowment grid, then define the distribution measure. Defining the risk aversion parameter at 1.25 and the future discount rate at 0.9973, we get [this graph from MATLAB](https://imgur.com/a/rWNkPjq).

In conclusion, we can see that Carly's [revealed preferences](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2548836?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) betray jealousy, and it is bad economics to imply that she only reacted negatively because Sam and Freddie kept a secret from her.",MambaMentaIity,t2_2vu9et4k,0.98,1978,83

> Minimum wage laws make it illegal to pay less than a government-specified price for labor. By the simplest and most basic economics, a price artificially raised tends to cause more to be supplied and less to be demanded than when prices are left to be determined by supply and demand in a free market. The result is a surplus, whether the price that is set artificially high is that of farm produce or labor.

This is a common fallacy of applying microeconomics to macroeconomics.  It's often accompanied by a supply-and-demand graph which shows the price set higher, the quantity demanded lower, and marks the gap between as ""unemployment"".

Let's start with some empirical data and move to the explanation of the mistake afterwards.  Fancy explanations don't really matter if reality says you're wrong.

There has in fact been a steady decrease in minimum wage as a portion of per-capita national income since 1960, with minimum wage trending roughly around a real minimum wage of $2,080 based in 1960.  The real mean wage has increased over this time, which indicates sag:  if raising minimum wage causes wage compression, then an expanding distance between minimum and mean wage indicates negative wage compression or ""sag"".

When measuring minimum wage as a portion of per-capita national income using the World Bank figures, the ratio of minimum to mean wage steadily widens as minimum wage falls.  Moreover, in periods between 1983 and 2018, we have minimum wages at the same levels spanning across decades, and so can measure this in varied economic conditions.  Even when measuring from the early 1990s to similar levels around 2010, the correlation is tight.

U3 unemployment, plotted against minimum wage as a portion of per-capita income, ranged 3.5% to 8% with minimum wage levels between 50% and 80% of per-capita income.  This includes levels spanning of 5% and 7.5% U3 with minimum wage at 50% GNI/C; levels as low as 4.5% and as high as 8% with minimum wage at 55% GNI/C; and levels as low as 3.5% and as high as 6% with minimum wage near 70% GNI/C.

United States minimum wage has spent a large amount of history between 20% and 40% of GNI/C.  U3 has robustly spanned 4% to 8% in this time, with three points in between going as high as 10%.  All this scattering of the unemployment rate is caused by the continuous downtrend of minimum wage across time:  the unemployment rate has spiked up and down through recessions and recoveries across the decades, and the numbers on the plot against minimum wage just go along for the ride.

So what happened to [supply and demand](http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BasicModel.png)?

That chart shows a microeconomic effect:  the quantity demanded of some good or service decreases with an increase in price.

As it turns out, labor isn't a single good.  This is self-evident because different labor-hours are purchased at different prices.

If you walk into a grocery store and you see Cloverfield Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, $4, and directly next to it you see Cloverfield Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, $2, with signs indicating they were packed in the same plant on the same day from the same stock, your quantity demanded of Cloverfield Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, $4 is…zero.  It doesn't matter if you are desperate for milk.  There is this milk here for half as much.  Unless you *run out of $2 milk that is exactly the same as $4 milk*, you're going to buy $2 milk.

Interestingly, in 1961, minimum wage was 0.775 × national per-capita income; it was at that time 0.610 × mean wage.  In 2010, minimum wage was 0.309 × GNI/C and 0.377 × mean wage.  There's a pretty strong correlation between these two figures, but let's take the conceptual numbers for simplicity.

First, the mean wage.  The division of labor reduces the amount of labor invested in producing.  Putting division of labor theory aside (because it can be trivially proven false), an increase in productivity reduces labor-hours to produce a thing (by definition).  We can make a table by hand with 3 labor-hours of work *or* we can invest a total of 1 labor-hour of work between designing, building, maintaining, and operating a machine to make the table in 1 labor-hour.

The mean wage is all labor wage divided by all labor-hours, and so all new labor-saving processes converge toward a strict mean average labor-hour cost of the mean wage (again, this is by definition).  Some will be above, some will be below, of course.

Let's say the minimum wage is 0.25 × mean wage.  Replacing that 3 labor-hours of minimum-wage work with 1 labor-hour of efficient work *increases* costs by, on average, 1/3.  The demand for higher-wage labor is undercut by a cheaper production price.

Minimum wage becomes 0.5 × mean wage.  Replacing the 3 labor-hours with 1 labor-hour in this model cuts your costs to 2/3. You *save* 1/3 of your labor costs.

Now you have two excess workers.

Are their hands broken?

So long as you don't have a liquidity crisis—people here want to work, people here want to buy, but the consumers don't have money so the workers don't have jobs—you have two workers who can be put to work to supply more.  The obvious solution for any liquidity crisis is to recognize people aren't working because there are jobs for them but no little tokens to pass back and forth saying they worked and are entitled to compensation in the form of some goods or services (somebody else's labor) and inject stimulus.  (This actually doesn't work all the time:  in a post-scarcity economy where there is no need to exchange money because all people have all the goods they could ever want and no labor need be invested in producing anything anyone could ever want, unemployment goes to 100% and nothing will stop it.  Until we can spontaneously instantiate matter by mere thought, the above principles apply.)

It turns out there are a countable but uncounted number of those little supply-demand charts describing all the different types and applications of labor, and they're always shifting. Your little business probably follows that chart; the greater macroeconomy?  It's the whole aggregate of all the shifts, of new businesses, of new demand.

That's why Caplan, Friedman, and Sowell are wrong; and that's why the data consistently proves them wrong:

I believed that would change when I saw NBA player De'Aaron Fox post what appeared to be low-hanging fruit:

[She making more than me after taxes 💀](https://twitter.com/swipathefox/status/1025061265868091392)

I thought that this was low-hanging fruit that could be R1'd with a bit of effort and perhaps a discussion of marginal tax rates. So, I began typing out my post:

*For context, he's referring to how another NBA player, Blake Griffin, was ordered to [pay $3,096,000 per year](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/08/02/blake-griffin-child-support-payments-detroit-pistons-los-angeles-court) in child support to his ex-fiancee Brynn Cameron.*


*So, we begin with $3,096,000 in annual income for Cameron. I tried to look for other possible sources of income, but to no avail. Just to add something else, I added the [median annual earnings for white, 25 to 54-year-old women in the United States](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/wkyeng.t03.htm), which comes out to $43,628 per year ($839 * 52) (granted, these stats are from the second quarter of 2018). So let's say Cameron has an annual income of $3,139,628, and let's ignore taxes.*

*Fox is currently on a [rookie scale salary](https://hoopshype.com/player/deaaron-fox/salary/). He will earn $5,470,920 in the 2018/2019 season, and if his team, the Sacramento Kings, picks up his team option, he will earn $6,392,760 and $8,099,627 in 2019/2020 and 2020/2021, respectively. If the Kings choose to pick up his qualifying offer for the 2021/2022 season, he will make at least $10,740,105, granted that he isn't offered more money (I believe that's how it works). In addition, Fox [secured a shoe deal with Nike](https://www.seccountry.com/kentucky/deaaron-fox-nike-shoe-deal), though I couldn't find how much money he would receive from it. Let's ignore that shoe deal and just stick to his NBA salary.*

*So now, we get to the fun part: calculating Fox's net pay. I'll be using the [tables from this article](https://www.bna.com/taxes-ballhog-majority-n73014470964/) to aid my calculations. Thus, we take out federal tax, state tax, a jock tax, escrow, an agent fee, a 401k contribution, and add a return on escrow and a shortfall return. For 2018/2019, Fox is making*

This is when I stopped typing the post and started making calculations. Oh boy. His tax bill, according to my calculations, was the following: 2,024,240.4 + 727,632.36 + 164,127.6 + 547,092 + 18,000 = $3,481,092.36. That's more than half of his 2018/2019 salary. I then calculated his escrow return (170,540.4 + 61,302.36 -> 460,920 - 231,842.76 = 229,077.24) and added it to his after-tax salary to get $2,218,904.88. 

At this point, I pretty much conceded defeat. The largest shortfall return I found was $214,691, belonging to James Harden, who is a superstar. The fact that De'Aaron 1. is not a superstar and 2. lives in California means his shortfall return probably won't make up the $920,723.12 difference I calculated between his income and Cameron's. I considered including an estimate for his Nike endorsement, but I believe that's subject to at least federal and state taxes, meaning around 50% of his endorsement will be taxed (marginal tax rates of 37% + 13.3%). To make up the $920,723.12 difference, his endorsement would have to be at least $1,830,463.46. For reference, the #1 pick from his draft class received a $1.5 million endorsement (Fox was the 5th pick). Even if Fox received a $1.5 million endorsement, he'd receive at most $754,500. He would then need a $166,223 shortfall return, and superstar players such as LeBron James and Stephen Curry received ~$200,000 in shortfall returns. Basically, it would take the absolute best-case scenarios for my R1 to be correct.

Watch out for [what you think](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Tantalus/tantalus.html) is low-hanging fruit.

Tl;dr: My R1 attempt didn't exactly go as planned, but I learned a lot about NBA salary taxes from it!

EDIT: I made a poor mistake in the income tax calculations and forgot to make the 37% and 13.3% *marginal* taxes. However, after plugging numbers into a [calculator](https://www.irscalculators.com/tax-calculator), it doesn't seem to change the fact that I'm wrong here; I also forgot to take out a jock tax yesterday when running my calculations since I couldn't find an exact methodology, but it seems to be ~$200k for California players. This is more than the difference between my calculations for his federal/state taxes and his actual taxes according to a calculator.

EDIT 2: Blake [only has to pay 32k a month](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.yahoo.com/amphtml/sports/no-blake-griffin-isnt-playing-258000-per-month-child-support-230210368.html).

870,2twaoe,2015-01-28,badeconomics,"Is a basic income badeconomics? No, not really. But there is a lot of badeconomics in the /r/basicincome FAQ (Part 1)","Basic income gets a lot of crap on this subreddit. None of think it's badeconomics in and of itself, but many of us have noticed that there's a pretty strong correlation between badeconomics and people advocating for a basic income.

Maybe we've been cherry picking. Maybe most basic income on reddit is badeconomics for the same reason that most Keynesian economics is badeconomics, and most anarchocapitalism is badeconomics. *Most* stuff is badeconomics.

But if it's not, the one place where you'd hope to find basic income arguments that past muster would be the ""Basic Income FAQ"" at /r/basicincome. Let's do a deep dive into it, and see what we find:

> **Eliminates the ""unemployment trap"".** Under current systems, when someone gets a job they lose most of their welfare payments. This means they can go from not working at all to working a full week without significantly increasing their income. This is a disincentive to work. Under basic income, when people got a job they would retain the same basic income payment, with their salary added to it, so the disincentive no longer exists.

This is reasonable! See Greg Mankiw on [Poverty Traps](http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2009/11/poverty-trap.html). 

“Notice that as earned income rises from about $15,000 to $30,000, income after taxes and transfers is roughly flat. Indeed, it could even fall. The bottom line: If you are poor, the government is inadvertently ensuring that you have little incentive to try to improve your condition.”

This is a big problem, and one of the best arguments for basic income, in my opinion. Glad that it's on top!

This is *good economics*.

***

> **Reduces government bureaucracy**. A lot of government workers are required to ensure that welfare recipients are not claiming their benefits fraudulently, and to administer the complicated system of welfare payments and tax credits. The increased need for personal tax advisers also sucks skilled workers out of the productive sector. A basic income would hugely simplify the welfare system by replacing most of these bureaucracies, which would reduce its administrative cost significantly.

This is pretty innaccurate. I'll let Krugman handle it:

""As Mike says, this notion rests on the belief that the welfare state is a crazily complicated mess of inefficient programs, and that simplification would save enough money to pay for universal grants that are neither means-tested nor conditional on misfortune. But the reality is nothing like that. The great bulk of welfare-state spending comes from a handful of major programs, and these programs are fairly efficient, with low administrative costs.

Actually, the cost of bureaucracy is in general vastly overestimated. Compensation of workers accounts for only around 6 percent of non defense federal spending, and only a fraction of that compensation goes to people you could reasonably call bureaucrats.*

There might be some slight gains, but they just aren't as big as BI advocates claim.

I dub this claim *bad economics*.

***

> **Greatly reduces fraud/waste/abuse**. When welfare subsidies are contingent on conditions like employment, income level, number of hours worked, family status, etc, there are opportunities to game the system, either by illegally lying (fraud) or by simply obeying the economic incentives put in front of you (waste/abuse). These cause losses of real economic value, which are paid for by every taxpayer. Removing this incentive structure allows confidence in the welfare system's ability to reach people exactly as intended.

What?

First of all, my understanding is that fraud rates under the current system are actually fairly low. For example, [CBPP has only 1% of SNAP benefits being trafficed](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=3239). Heck, if anything, there's a much bigger problem with *qualified* people not getting their benefits - [for example, the median county only has EITC take up rates of 16.2%](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/01/30-variation-eitc-takeup-county-harris)

In any case, I don't really see the argument here. Why is fraud less likely to occur under a basic system than a means-tested system? It's much easier to falsify the existence of a given individual than it is to create an employment record, etc. Get a falsified birth record, and collect BI! 

Maybe there could be something where bureaucrats check these numbers, but that's cutting against the ""reduces bureaucracy"" argument.

I dub this claim *bad economics*.

***

> **Guarantees a minimum living standard**. Though it's subjective/politicized, people may be entitled to a certain basic standard of living, regardless of whether they are momentarily able to participate in the labor market. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 25, states, ""Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control."" (United Nations, (UN)).

Uh. OK.

This is a normative claim, not a positive one. Nothing wrong with it. 

It's not badeconomics, it's just noteconomics.

***

> **Increases bargaining power for workers**. Workers will be able to afford to refuse a job if the employer abuses its oligopoly or the workspace has poor conditions, so firms will be forced to improve the employment conditions and wages for their workers. This will happen as a natural result of negotiation between firms and workers, and will not require government intervention or unionization.

What? *What?*

As reddit's biggest defender of monopsony models (as a useful framework for thinking about the labor market), this is a little unclear to me.

Let's be generous. Best as I can tell, they are thinking about this using some sort of Rubinstein bargaining framework. Basic income gives the laborer more bargaining power, because they are more able to hold out for better offers. That's not unreasonable. Indeed, it's something that I think should be incorporate into a labor market model. 

[Bowles (1992)](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~bowles/1992EJPE.pdf) does a good job of creating such a model, and that model is going to underly a lot of my thinking here (mostly because this was a homework question when I took his class 12 years ago). I'm not going to go into too much detail for space reasons (and you can just click the link) but this model differs from the standard neoclassical goods market in three respects:

* Employee effort enters into the production function. That is to say, work productivity increases with effort, and effort  causes disutility in the workforce.

* Productivity is noisy. Effort and hours enter into the production function, but so does a random exogenous number. 

* Employers are unable to costlessly monitor employee effort. They may pay a cost in order to (probabilistically) monitor  workers' effort level. If they observe a worker with low effort, they will fire the worker.

* Workers have a reservation wage - usually interpreted as unemployment insurance.

This has a lot of very nice properties. Using this model, labor markets do not clear (there is always a non-zero amount of unemployed people). Workers choose an effort level that equates the marginal benefit of effort (ie, the increased probability of keeping your job over your reservation wage) with the marginal cost (ie, the disutility of effort). Having job is valuable - the present value of ""having a job"" is the reservation wage plus employment rents (those of you who recall the [Harris and Todaro AotW]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1xgh6e/article_of_the_week_migration_unemployment_and/) might notice some interesting parallels).

Workers choose an effort level to maximize their expected utility, employers choose a monitoring strategy, a wage, and worker hours to maximize profit. Both of these choices are mutual best responses.

Ok, back to talking about basic income.

So, using this framework, the way a basic income would affect a worker's bargaining power is by changing their reservation wage.
The problem here is that workers are *already getting* unemployment insurance under the status quo. Basic income advocates typically argue in favor of replacing current welfare and unemployment insurance payments with a basic income. In other words, you take the reservation wage and put it on both sides of the equation. This *reduces* your bargaining power relative to the status quo.

Moreover, the basic income would have to be substantially smaller than the current unemployment insurance in order to pay off everyone and maintain current levels of economic productivity and investment. [Bowles (1992)](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~bowles/1992EJPE.pdf) looks into it pretty thoroughly, and figure out the biggest possible MW under this scenario is equal to the current reservation wage times the (1 – the labor participation rate). Bowles calculated this to be $4,208 in his 1992 paper. Updating his numbers to the present day, I’m getting $8,019.

This claim is *bad economics*.

***

> Lowers need for government regulations on the labor market. Policies such as the minimum wage will become less necessary with the basic income, as people will already get enough money to live on from the basic income. And negotiating power for workers will increase. This will allow the government to remove some of the regulations on the labor market, creating a freer market and providing benefits for both employers and employees.

This basically follows from the former. Again, it doesn’t make any sense. As discussed in the previous section, it doesn’t make any sense to think of the basic income as something which increases workers’ bargaining power. 

This claim is *bad economics*.

***

> Reduces illegal immigration. With the minimum wage obsolete, manual labor can be priced at its fair-market value, meaning illegal immigrants will not stand to gain as much by working illegally and being paid under-the-table. The US's neighbors to the south would suddenly realize that the only profitable way to enter America is via the proper legal system. And all with no need for a militarized border!

What? This is such a bizarre reading of why illegal immigrants come to United States. It isn’t because of the minimum wage – it’s because wages *generally* increase when you cross the border, as worker productivity increases (for various reasons – better institutions, higher capitalization, etc.).

This claim is *bad economics*.

* The US still has tremendous leverage even in free trade pacts and has in the past ignored or even sidestepped international bodies when it suits economic and political interests

* Aside from some isolated incidents on /r/rage, not only is being in consumer (and arguably car/mortgage) debt not an imprisonable offense that bonds someone to the debtor but it's not a criminal offense

* Consumer credit card and related debts are routinely written off to collection agencies for 20% of the principal to say nothing of the many states where debts cannot be pursued after 7 years

* While educational debt is a big problem, especially the size of the principal, we've had grants as well as legislation ensuring the interest rates are subsidized, deferred, or are just lower than than the rate charged for other types of loans.  The size of the principal requires reform in higher education which is a whole different issue than the TPP.

* Feudalism also wouldn't happen because in a world of free labor, no debtor or country would want to keep you around with free room and board

* While the wealthy obviously enjoy far more leisure time including vacations and multiple properties, those are all options still available to the middle class which is also still here.  Technology has also expanded the scope of and lowered the cost of leisure time (reddit included) and vacationing to new places is easier now than before (barring unrelated TSA regulations) thanks to that technology.

* While income inequality is wider than it has been since the 80's or the 50's (depending on which figures you use), **material inequality** is far far narrower than ever before.  Access to information, services, most electronic goods, and to influence other people are measurably more equal than they were in the past.

* The demographics of the wealthy have also changed in the past two decades with far more ""working rich"" whose assets are in capital instead of land or one specific firm or plain out inheritors as it's been since well, forever.

I will not focus on their leftist dictatorship, nor on the fact that Cuba has had the ability to trade with most of the west for some time now (as proven by the fact that I can acquire a Cuban cigar in my local supermarket), or that Cuba could always trade with some superpowers. 

The [comment in question](https://np.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/q15m71/record_number_of_cuban_players_12_defect_during/hfcnufk/) was this. 

> A country who gets stomped on by the biggest country in the world and said country forces other countries not to trade w/ them and that leads to trouble? Nope, must be their left leaning policies??

And a couple of responses to a comment I made, [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/q15m71/record_number_of_cuban_players_12_defect_during/hfdduin/) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/q15m71/record_number_of_cuban_players_12_defect_during/hfdfazr/).

The first response says

> I love when people try to say this like they know the country would still be rough even if it wasn't fucked by America. We have no clue how it'd be doing because we can only see it for how it's been treated. Being fucked by America has lead it to its current political state.

And the second one

> The embargo isn’t the reason they are poor? Do you know how international trade works?

While it is true that the island is in a very rough condition, and that the USA does have en embargo with Cuba, one cannot assume one causes the other. Many poor countries don't have embargoes, yet, they are poor. And with the help of International Finance, we can see how the problems are not caused by the embargo, but by Cuba's terrible macroeconomic policies. 

Now let's get a little context on the Cuban economy:

While the government's grip on the Cuban economy has certainly lessened since the 80s, the state still control's around three quarters of Cuba's economic activity, and employs around the same ammount of people.

> [The government, both directly and through state-owned enterprises, was still the source of more than three-quarters of Cuba’s economic activity.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/28/what-we-know-about-cubas-economy/) 

Not only this, but wages are abysmaly low, averaging around [$50 per month](https://tradingeconomics.com/cuba/wages). The government maintains a list of private sector occupations, mostly related to tourism (like restaurants and taxi drivers). Those Cubans who work in the touristic sectors that do price their services in convertible pesos make much more money than workers on government salaries. [This creates an odd situation where highly trained and well-educated workers in occupations mainly provided by the state — engineers, say, academics or even doctors — are incentivised to take jobs as waiters and taxi drivers.](https://www.ft.com/content/98c2b666-41cd-3635-bc03-2f8fb6d8b1b7)

Cuba is also incredibly unproductive on the agricultural sector. 

> [Farm yields are pathetically low, despite Cuba having possibly the richest soil of any tropical country in the world](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/28/organic-or-starve-can-cubas-new-farming-model-provide-food-security)

Productivity is low for a number of reasons — lack of machinery, government as the sole crop purchaser, other various bad policies, and the legacy of a system that was more geared toward producing sugar exports rather than food. On top of this, it's archaic food industry, which heavily depends on fuel, has been in crisis since 2016, because they imported most of it's fuel from Venezuela, at a premium price. But Venezuela has faced an economic collapse for a good amount of years now. Since Cuba can't get oil, many farmers have resorted to using very unproductive methods, like using animals.

Now, we can go on to the worst thing about Cuba's macroeconomic policy: it's dual currency system. For a long time Cuba had two currencies, one pegged to the dollar 1 to 1, and one that was worth much less (around .042 USD right now). The former was used to trade, and the latter was used domestically. A country can create their own currency and it can be used for domestic transactions, but for international transactions, it must use a foreign currency, generally dollars, yens, euros or pounds. Cuba used their dual currency system, to hoard international reserves which they used to buy imported products, mainly food, since it's important and they can't produce as much as they needed, and it was then repriced in domestic pesos. 

Now, regarding the embargo: It is not a blockade; countries can trade with Cuba, in fact it's [27% of their GDP.](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS?most_recent_value_desc=false) This would not be the case if a blockade was in place. Hell, in fact, most of Cuba's food imports [are American. ](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2021/07/01/cuba-is-facing-its-worst-shortage-of-food-since-the-1990s) This is because the embargo was modified in 2000, and allowed for the US to export food and medicine to Cuba. 

While Cuba can't sell cigars, rum or sugar to the US, their ability to get foreign currencies is not particularly diminished, given that they can freely trade with China and Europe, and they do. But they have a constant trade deficit, since they peg their currency too highly (1 peso to 1 dollar) which makes their exports incredibly expensive. Another way Cuba gets foreign exchange is through tourism. But Covid ravaged that industry, so the entry of foreign currencies through tourism became practically nil. Add to this that the elimination of the dual currency scheme meant taht Cubans could hold dollars freely, and this caused a massive capital flight (not really, but kinda), since Cubans held dollars instead of using them to buy food.

So the Cuban state faced a conoundrum in how to spend their foreign currency. Oil not sold at a premium price, or food and machinery. Either way, it means less food. On top of that, the Covid crisis, which made food prices skyrocket, and they needed to spend an even bigger chunk of their scarce currency buying food, which exacerbated the crisis. So Cuba was already in a crisis caused by poor macro policy, that was simply exacerbated by Covid.",baseballnomics,t2_c3keg5ax,0.88,270,81

Correct, the increased cost of housing is a very huge issue for the entire bay area.  Unfortunately, rent control is a small bandaid placed on a gaping wound.  The real solution is more housing.  Rents depend on three things:

 - the amount of housing
 - the number of jobs
 - how much these jobs pay

Unless you want to reduce jobs or decrease salaries, the only way to decrease the cost of housing in the long term is by building more housing.

> To landlords who keep rents reasonable, thank you!  Vote YES on Measure V to stop opportunistic rent increases and unwarranted evictions by others.

Or we could build more housing so supply and demand doesn't allow the opportunity for massive rent increases.

> Measure V makes housing costs predictable and stable, freeing seniors and others from constant fear of losing their homes.

For existing tenants, it does make costs predictable and stable and reduces the fear of being evicted for not being able to afford rent, but can create strong incentive for landlords to find reasons to evict tenants who are paying far under market rate.  This can be seen in Ellis Act evictions in San Francisco.

> Rents have increased 54% since 2012.  Wages have not kept pace, putting profound stress on the community.  As we lose beloved family and community members, we lose Mountain View's qualify of life.

The city should really consider building a lot more housing.

> Vote YES on Measure V to protect over 14,000 renting households while still being fair to landlords:

Ok, let's see what your plan to be fair to landlords is.

> Allows rents to be raised 25% annually, depending on the rate of inflation (typically 23%)

Unfortunately, the proposition states that rent can't be raised more than the annual CPI increase.  This is dramatically different from allowing 25% rent increases and would fall well below the 54% increase in rents which the market has set since 2012.  This is a huge misrepresentation of what the rent control law would actually be.

> Allows larger rent increases for increased maintenance costs or property taxes or if a landlord skips a year

Under these conditions, rent increases are capped at 10% per year.  This is entirely reasonable, rent increases of 10% per year would allow rent controlled rates to quickly catch up to any increase in market rates.

> Limits evictions to specific situations (unpaid rent, illegal activity, etc), preventing evictions just to raise rents

The simplest way to prevent evictions just to raise rents is to not have rent control.

> Protects families too frightened to report unsafe conditions for fear of retaliatory evictions.

Fair enough, we aren't going to take the time to read the details of this in the proposed law.

> Exempts all units built after February 1, 1995, as well as singlefamily homes, duplexes, condos, and inlaw units, and all new housing (does not discourage growth).

Good.  Not having rent control on new units will encourage developers to build more housing.  Now all we need is for the city to approve the construction of more housing.

> Rolls back rents to October 2015 levels

Landlords will rationally raise rents in response to the threat of having their units rent controlled and this does prevent that.  Unfortunately, this removes a year of rent increases (during a period where rent increased 54% in 4 years) so that immediately puts rents at 5-10% below market rate instantly if the proposition passes.

> Creates an independent Committee to administer and enforce the law, providing flexibility, accountability, and transparency

Nothing unreasonable here.

> Allows the creation of similar protections for mobile home residents.

So this law does not explicitly exclude creating rent control laws for mobile homes?",FreyasSpirit,t2_4233u,0.95,100,142

879,4zajlh,2016-08-24,badeconomics,"The Trouble with ""Meaningless Jobs"": An R1 for the Hungry R1 God","#A Brief Introduction

One of my pet bits of badecon is the old Buckminster Fuller quote:

>“We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.”

While I do agree that there are interesting philosophical questions about the sort of Protestant Ethic ""If a man will not work, he shall not eat"" kind of rationale espoused by some.  That said, I do not think there is some grand conspiracy to create ""meaningless jobs.""

In that vein, I present [this](http://singularityhub.com/2016/08/23/the-end-of-meaningless-jobs-will-unleash-the-worlds-creativity/) bit of nonsense posted over in our favorite badecon-generating machine: /r/Futurology.

Ultimately, the article's central claim is this: **productivity is hamstrung by meaningless jobs, and if only people would work less, productivity would increase exponentially.**

#Criticism 1: Costs Without Benefits (For Firms)

>In 1930, John Maynard Keynes predicted that automation would create a 15-hour work week for everyone in Britain and the United States. Graeber argues that we failed to live up to this prediction, not because of a failure of automation, but because of the fear of the social effects that would occur when large numbers of people had large amounts of unstructured time.

It's quite a bizarre claim that a grand social conspiracy is afoot to keep workers active while at the same time replacing them with automation, thus rendering them inactive.  

So let's talk about the logical inconsistency there.  We know from our principles of microeconomics courses that labor is an input, which makes it part of some firm's total cost function.  We also know that costs are minimized when the marginal benefit of adding one more unit of some input is equal to the marginal cost of that additional unit.  If MB>MC, then they're leaving potentially greater productivity on the table, if MC<MB, then they're incurring additional cost with no additional benefit.

The crux of the claim is the latter.  So I guess my question is this: **you mean to tell me that these worker-hating firms that are so hell-bent on squeezing costs as much as they can are actually creating meaningless jobs so they can WILLFULLY INCUR COSTS WITHOUT BENEFITS?**

#Criticism 2: Costs Without Benefits (for Workers)

Economics is all about the margins: what's the benefit of one extra...whatever?  Everyone makes choices at the margins: firms, workers, benevolent social planners, and feckless dictators (I'm looking at you, /u/Wumbotarian).  I talked about this briefly in my first criticism, mainly from the point of view of the firm, but let's look at the worker:

If you've taken an intermediate micro or labor course, you know that the [supply of labor curve is backward-bending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_bending_supply_curve_of_labour), a phenomenon reflecting the labor-leisure tradeoff along with the income and substitution effects.  Here's what I mean: in a very general sense, workers have a choice on whether to work (and earn) more while giving up leisure, or work (and earn) less while gaining leisure.  Whatever their choice, we can assume that most people are choosing (inasmuch as they can) the combination of work and leisure that works best for them.

>To date, a lot of people had only two options for work: income and dissatisfaction, or no income and freedom. Neither of these are particularly appealing.

>Larry Page offers a solution: “Work less,” which would certainly reduce the amount of time people spent on unsatisfactory jobs and provide more opportunities for people to pursue their true interests.

This is the suggestion the author of this article gives while at the same time bemoaning stagnant real wages.  ""Low wages are a problem!"" -> ""Hey, maybe you should work less.""

Ok, so we could assume that a worker's utility is only a function of labor and leisure, let's call them L_1 and L_2, so we have workers maximizing U(L_1,L_2) subject to some budget constraint L_1*wage≥budget.  We could set up the Lagrangian: ℒ(L_1,L_2,λ)=∇U(L_1,L_2)-λ∇Constraint and find first order and second order conditions, but it's much easier to just prax it out:

In general, people have a pretty good idea of what maximizes their own utility.  If most people COULD work less, they would, but the opportunity cost is too high.  Again, the author suggests increased cost without any increased benefit.

#Criticism 3: Obscuring some goodeconomics in a whole bunch of badeocnomics

That's right, there's some good(ish) economics in here:

>Automation certainly won’t mean the death of human work. In the best of all possible worlds, it will mean an end to work that is unfulfilling. For some, that would mean time spent creating and inventing, for others that might mean a lot of time spent playing with all those new creations and inventions, which is kind of the point.

That's what we've been saying all along, right?  Automation isn't a wanton job-killer, but rather it reallocates labor to where humans have the comparative advantage.  And sure, lots of that will involve creativity.  However, we are not slaves to ""meaningless jobs"" in the meantime.

And further, a little rant of my own: if you need to find personal meaning and fulfillment in what you DO rather than who you ARE, then it might be time to think a little less about economics and do a little soul-searching.  In the words of Tyler Durden:

>You are not your job, you're not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You are not your fucking khakis. You are all singing, all dancing crap of the world.",iamelben,t2_580t2,0.87,21,12

RI: The author makes... dubious assumptions about who is and isn't at risk from a total economic slowdown, with nice helpings of 'won't someone think of the poor businessowners?' Not sure if the R1 is supposed to be a summary or not, but if not, I've continued it paragraph by paragraph below.

>It is yet another sign of our political dysfunction that a government that dithered for weeks before getting serious about fighting a global pandemic now can’t take a few days for thoughtful debate about how to spend a trillion dollars to deal with the economic fallout.

Okay... full disclosure, I have been unhappy with this administration since it has existed, but 'responding too fast to the fastest economic slowdown anyone alive has ever seen' has not been one of my complaints. They're on the back foot already because they stupidly delayed quarantine and testing, and somehow the author has concluded from this that they should delay *more*, for little reason other than him personally disagreeing with them. Perhaps he will provide his reasoning further in the article (...don't hold your breath).

>Let’s just do a little simple arithmetic.

oh no

>There are about 330 million people living in the United States. About 75 million of those are children under the age of 18. There are about 10 million students who spend most of their time studying at colleges and universities. And there are 65 million Americans who live primarily off pensions and monthly checks from the Social Security Administration. Few of those 150 million children, students and seniors will lose much income as a result of layoffs and business closures caused by the pandemic.

There are... a lot of things wrong with this paragraph. For one, the idea that student incomes - likely to be tied to service industries that need to be shut down in quarantine - are somehow safer from losses in quarantine (that has *already* shut down universities and displaced students) is asserted as obvious and true by the author with literally no evidence. Secondly, Social Security requires a functioning economy to, itself, function - it's not an endless pot immune to total economic slowdown. Listing some of the country's most economically vulnerable demographics as being safe from effectively total economic slowdown is absurd enough by itself, but this gentleman has taken that one step further, and implied that children, who have, by-and-large, zero income, are thus safe from income losses. Technically, yes, I suppose that an unemployed child can't lose a job or income they do not have - but the tax code does call these diminutive economic freeloaders 'dependents' for a reason.

>In addition, there are, by my count, roughly 100 million workers who are likely to continue to receive most of their normal wage and salary income either because they will continue to show up for work, or work from home, or be paid even though they are not working.

The author's 'count' is, of course, completely unsourced. He's pulled 'roughly' 100 million quarantine-proof workers 'roughly' from his... exactly the orifice you're thinking of. How will 2/3rds of the 'roughly' 150 million jobs in the US 'continue to receive most of their normal wage and salary income'? Perhaps they can pull their unprecedented-quarantine-proof-salaries from the same place this author got all 100 million of *them*.

>This 100 million includes about 33 million government workers and public school teachers who will continue to be paid. It includes 3 million farmers who will continue to produce our food, 1 million people involved in processing and distributing that food and 3 million workers at grocery and beverage stores who will sell it. And it includes the 3 million people working for information technology, Internet and telecommunications companies that will keep us all wired up and entertained, the 9 million working in finance and the 10 million in law, accounting, consulting and other professional firms, most of whom are already working at home.

Public school teachers *are* government workers, but more to the point here, their salaries and whether or not they 'will continue to get paid' as this so confidently asserts is not a decision made at a federal level - it's made at a state level, as with *many, many* government workers. This is largely dependent on state educational budgets, and at a federal level the hostility Betsy DeVos has for giving anything other than middle fingers to public schools does not instill me with confidence that all public education staff will continue to get paid. 33 million government workers, 3 million farmers, 1 million food distributors, 3 million grocery retail workers, 3 million tech industry workers, 9 million finance workers, and 10 million legal workers, using Simple Math^(tm), adds up to a whopping 62 million. Not only is he short his 100 million worker figure, he's also getting that 62 million figure from a base assumption of no mass layoffs (or even slowdowns - these are current figures, not taking quarantines into account) in every single industry he mentions - to say nothing of the possibility of any of these workers, y'know, actually getting sick.

>Let’s not forget the millions of workers who will be kept on the payrolls in the airline, cruise line, hotel and hospitality industries as a result of a $150 billion federal rescue package and millions more at smaller firms that will continue to meet payroll, thanks to $300 billion in loans from the Small Business Administration.

Even if we took the absurd leap of assuming that this rescue package and these loans will directly result in the maintenance of tourism industry payrolls, that still would not guarantee that all 'millions' (didn't even bother with a fantasy number, I'm disappointed) of said payrolls *can* be maintained that way, especially for as long as tourism is likely to be crippled by this pandemic. 

>That leaves about 80 million Americans whose income may be in jeopardy. To be sure, that’s a lot of workers needing help and a big hit to the economy. But those are not challenges best met by sending $1,200 checks to 250 million of their fellow citizens who are still getting paychecks and can’t even spend what they make — they can’t go shopping, or take a vacation or even go out for a nice dinner.

Can't go shopping? Nonsense, the grocery retailers, food distributors, and farmers are still fully paying their workers those wages that said workers didn't lose, remember? That means they're either still operational... or they're being used as dubiously necessary middlemen for the distribution of government aid, and not actually adding any value or function to the economy. How much of everyday American incomes does this guy think *isn't* going to essentials? Are they spending it all on that damn avocado toast?

>The better strategy is to get money into the hands of cash-strapped businesses that promise to use it to keep workers on their payrolls — or, if that fails, to get it into the hands of laid off workers who will probably spend it on essentials.

These are both massive assumptions to make, and the former has already been tried and largely failed the most at-risk people (people working retail or service jobs, especially as 'gig' or part-time work that is already subject to high turnover and volatility) in the years since 2008. Businesses *promising* 'to use [the money] to keep workers on their payrolls' in no way guarantees that they will *actually* keep workers on their payrolls. As for the spending part, what is it that you expect the 'not laid off officially but still economically vulnerable' people to spend the 'very bad idea' $1,200 on? If they spend it somewhere at all, it means that money is once again moving through the economy via potentially taxable transactions that would not have happened in the absence of the money. If they hoard it... wouldn't the economy be unaffected by it, by definition? The only one losing out there is the government itself. I find it interesting in a disturbing sense that this author's first priority is to businesses, and then *if that fails,* the laid off workers. If the businesses survive and some workers still get laid off, I wonder, would he conclude success or failure? In the former case, would the laid off workers be ignored and left to fend for themselves, and in the latter, would a sunk-cost fallacy merely result in doubling down on aid to businesses? How much and what kind of failure is necessary for this type of economic stimulus to *actually* get to the laid off workers? These are all questions that, naturally, he does not even attempt to answer.

>As an alternative, if the government were to send those 80 million laid off workers a $500 check (tax free) every week for eight weeks, that would be $4,000 apiece — enough to keep their collective spending somewhere close to where it is now. And at $320 billion, that would be significantly less than the White House and Republican Senate leaders propose to spend.

Spending less is not always better, austerity in a crisis is not necessarily a good idea. Ultimately, this is a philosophical question, not an economic one, though divorcing the economic reality from the philosophical implications of it is impossible - it depends heavily on how you think aid *should* be distributed, and that's ultimately subjective. Boiled down, it's a 2-dimensional spectrum of choices with 4 extremes - the first being helping as few people as possible as little as possible in order to spend as little as possible and minimize the risk of accidentally helping those who don't need it, the second being helping as few people as possible as much as possible to avoid 'accidental' help but attempt to maximize the help's effectiveness, the third being helping as many as possible as little as possible to minimize the risk of not helping those who do need it and minimize cost even if some help might be insufficient, and the last being to help as many as possible as much as possible, risking providing more aid than is necessary to more people than is necessary, and increasing the risk of overextension of resources. Answering that philosophical question for any systemic aid is necessary, but unfortunately it's possible to answer from one extreme without even realizing there are other options, or even realizing the question is asked implicitly by *any* decision of which economic aid policy to support.

>The only reason this foolish proposal is under serious consideration is that it was cooked up in secret over the weekend by politicians spooked by the rout on the stock market, worried about losing the next election and desperate to show they are doing something “big” other than bailing out private industries. There was no serious analysis done by professionals at the White House, Treasury or the Congressional Budget Office, no input from congressional committees, no consultation with Democrats and certainly no public debate.

This isn't economics, it's a political diatribe with a touch of conspiracy (for flavor, I guess). Also, no public debate? How in the hell am I reading your opinions that you posted on it, then?

>Now we are told by some who ought to know better that if Congress fails to throw a trillion dollars at the problem in the next few days, tens of millions of sales clerks and restaurant waiters and Uber drivers will go hungry, get thrown out of their homes and lose their Internet access, and economic Armageddon will be upon us.

Why ought they 'know better'? He, as per his habit so far, provides no evidenced rationale. Well, apart from his implication that anyone who disagrees with his opinion on the matter is wrong and stupid, and credit where credit is due, he provides a *ton* of evidence that he feels that way. A pity he can't seem to properly explain why.

>“Give Every American $2,000, Immediately,” demanded the very serious people at the New York Times in Thursday’s lead editorial, a mishmash of economic nonsense, liberal grievances and Democratic talking points.

This isn't economics, it's a political diatribe dripping with... vitriol. I guess the conspiracy seasoning from before wasn't quite flavorful enough.

>We need to stop for a moment and take a deep breath. This is a scary time. A lot has happened in the past three weeks. People are dying. Panic has overtaken financial markets. Countries are locking down their citizens and closing their borders. The global economy is tumbling into recession. Governments need to pull people together, act boldly and lend and spend freely.

Yeah, that's exactl-... wait, *what*?

>Freely, but not stupidly. The right antidote for not doing any of the right things for too long is not to do too much of the wrong thing too fast. Sending money to millions of voters who don’t need it and can’t spend it may be good politics, but its[sic] lousy economics.

Assuming the freemarket could come up with a more productive employee then it would maximize when that person is the most ""productive"".


So, **the big question**: are welfare programs a *subsidy* for employers in any meaningful economic sense? Let's investigate. 

First, we need to agree on what a subsidy for employers is. I say that a subsidy for employers is any payment from the government that either a) is received by employers as an increasing function of their number of employee hours, or that b) is a payment to workers or potential workers that causes wages to fall.  

So, are welfare programs subsidies for employers? Let's consider a couple of different welfare program designs and answer the question for each one. I suspect a splash of basic theory is largely all we'll need for each. Note: real welfare programs can draw upon elements from more than 1 type I list below, so bear in mind I'm not giving you a full on partition here.

**Welfare program type 1**: programs offered to people with low incomes which then phase out gradually (ie, without a cliff). Example programs include SNAP, arguably social security, and (for part of its schedule) the EITC.

For programs that gradually phase out benefits as income increases, within that phase out range, these programs encourage people to reduce their labor supply by effectively raising the marginal tax rate phased by the people receiving them. To the extent that people respond to these incentives, we would expect people to work fewer hours and for employers to bear some of the incidence of this marginal tax rate hike in the form of increased wages. 

**Verdict**: these are not employer subsidies.

**Welfare program type 2**: programs offered to people with low incomes that then disappear entirely after some threshold income (a cliff). Mainly, this is Medicaid, but we can also include old timey welfare (AFDC) and the like. 

This is tricky. Obviously, the cliffs create work disincentives, but the effect on wages is going to depend on annoying parameters like what the distribution of workers relative to the cliff would be without the program and the degree to which workers can adjust their intensive margin labor supplies (their number of hours worked given they work at all). Instead of thinking about theory-with-cliffs and being sad (I leave that exercise to the reader), here's some empirical evidence that Medicaid apparently doesn't put downward pressure on wages in general:  [1](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22540)  [2](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22118.pdf)

**Verdict**: these are not employer subsidies.

**Welfare program type 3**: programs offered to people with low incomes that have a work requirement of some sort. Example programs include the EITC and (depending on the state) TANF, Medicaid (per a very recent policy), and other programs.
 
When programs have work requirements they serve as extensive margin employment subsidies (that is, they provide a subsidy to you if you choose to work, period) and when benefits increase in hours worked (as in part of the EITC schedule) they also subsidize the intensive margin of employment (how many hours you work). Barring unrealistic labor supply and labor demand elasticities, you should expect the incidence of these subsidies to fall partly on the worker and partly on the employer, in the form of reduced wages. Indeed, this effect has been confirmed at least for the EITC by [Rothstein](http://www.nber.org/papers/w14966). I'm not aware of evidence on the effect of work requirements for TANF and what not on wages, though, so take that part with a grain of salt.

**Verdict**: these are employer subsidies, with the caveat that I am aware of little evidence to confirm the theoretical prediction about work requirements.

**Welfare program type 4**: programs that require you to be unemployed, such as unemployment insurance. 

These programs create incentives to remain unemployed and so raise the opportunity cost of work, discouraging employment on the intensive margin (do I get a job?) but not on the extensive margin (how many hours should I work?). In a good ol fashioned supply and demand model of the labor market, this is a negative labor supply shock that pushes up wages. In a search and matching model, this increases workers' outside option to employment, thus increasing their threat point in negotiations and allowing them to command higher wages (while increasing unemployment). In any case, there is upward pressure on wages.

**Verdict**: these are not employer subsidies.

**Welfare program type 5**: programs that are universal (or targeted based on some characteristic people cannot manipulate). Examples include Medicare and the Alaska permanent fund.

This is a bit trickier than the above policies, seeing as these programs are not a function of income at all. I would point out, however, that if utility is concave in income, in a search and matching model, these universal programs can notably improve the threat point for really broke people since, well, u(ubi+salary) - u(ubi) < u(salary) - u(0). That suggests the availability of these programs improve worker bargaining power and put upward pressure on wages. Also, Medicare is a special case here since problems with health insurance markets make it difficult to buy decent insurance in the individual market, generating substantial bargaining power for firms --- Medicare takes that away.  

**Verdict**: these are not employer subsidies.

Welfare program type 6: direct subsidies paid to employers, as found in various active labor market programs that include payments for hiring various types of workers (eg, the formerly long term unemployed) or in sweet heart deals made between politicians and favored industries (eg, coal mining). 

**Verdict**: these are employer subsidies.


**What have we learned from all of the above?** We've learned that welfare programs do not in general constitute employer subsidies. Rather, welfare programs only function as employer subsidies when they **a)** literally include an employer subsidy, **b)** offer benefits that *increase* in income, or **c)** feature work requirements (probably - put less certainty on point c when you update your priors).

As a side note, ironically enough, OP is (accidentally) right about minimum wage increases reducing the extent to which welfare programs function as subsidies -- at least in the case of the EITC, per Rothstein, min wage hikes really do have that effect!

I would also like to acknowledge that my RI is in some sense intentionally missing **OP's moral point**. When people complain about employer ""subsidies"" I think they often don't mean anything in particular in terms of having their words correspond with facts and reality. Rather, they intend a moral point and have a ""moral economy"" model of sorts in mind where employers have an obligation to guarantee that their employees meet some minimum living standard and that welfare programs ""subsidize"" them in some sort of moral sense in that the welfare programs are helping to get their employees past that minimum living standard. By using the term ""subsidy"" to point out that it is a government program doing this rather than the employers, folks are just pointing out that employers may not have legitimately fulfilled their moral obligations since they did not get their employees' minimum living standard up to par on their own. 

I think this is a fine enough point to make morally and am highly sympathetic to it, but I believe it should be made clearly and on its own terms, rather than by mixing positive and normative statements into a cocktail where they blend together and no longer can be distinguished. Moreover, slapping a moral parity onto the term subsidy is probably not a good idea: there are plenty of things we should be comfortable with that are subsidies (eg, the EITC seems to have all around great consequences) and I'm not sure anyone is better served by turning the word ""subsidy"" into a slur.

>Corollary: Investors do not create jobs,only customers create jobs.

Even if workers were the ""real wealth creators,"" how does this imply that investors are irrelevant to production? Has capital been left in the production function all this time by mistake? (Someone pointed this out and is currently at -1)

Now I understand that this person is aligned with poorer people and decided to equate workers with consumers and celebrate them both, but unknowingly, he absolves the investor-executive class from any responsibility in Recessions. If good investment cannot create jobs, then bad investment cannot cause financial recessions and destroy jobs.

Further down:

>[""The Corollary""] is the supply and demand mantra. You can't create jobs if there's no demand for your product (you can, but they won't last long).

Of course demand is a factor, but this in no way invalidates the role of investment: I want a Tesla S. The reason I can't buy one must be because there's insufficient demand for Tesla Ss.",clairmontbooker,t2_isfun,0.77,9,8
884,9p2ssz,2018-10-17,badeconomics,"Jean-Marc Jancovici, energy elasticity and consumption causality","In France, we have ~~a physicist~~ an engineer named [Jean-Marc
Jancovici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Marc_Jancovici), who's an expert
about everything surrounding climate and energy questions. He's a *very good*
popularizer, he frequently appears on TV to dispell common myths around energy
(like how [investing in renewable energies doesn't reduce our carbon footprint
since our energy supply is mainly nuclear, so it's a waste of
money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQeO_d0PTEo)). (Oh, yeah, this R1 will
probably be full of links in french, sorry. This sub is too americentric, let's bring in more diversity.) For
all these reasons, I really like him, because he's exactly the kind of
pragmatist that we need to deal with this huge issue, people who have a deep
knowledge of the advantages and drawbacks of the different energy sources, to
help us lower our carbon emissions.

But there's a problem with Jancovici. He's not an economist, but he frequently
*talks* about economics. Which wouldn't be a problem in itself if most of what he
said wasn't on the edge of *batshit insane*. It really undermines his whole
(otherwise very good) discourse, in my opinion.

Now, I'm nowhere near an expert in this field, but he's not either, so I think
it's fair game that I try to R1 some of the stuff he recently said.

Anyway, here's a recent talk from him (in English!):
[Can we save energy, jobs and growth at the same time ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGt4XwBbCvA).
This talk contains all the arguments that Jancovici makes about economics, so
I'll use that as the main subject of the R1.

> [18:19] If you pump, you get oil. It happens that all this process of going
> from ocean microorganisms to an oil field is free. Nobody paid a single cent
> for that. [...] It's a convention in the economic system, which is a major
> flaw.

Jancovici is talking about the externalities of non-renewable consumption here,
which is good economics. While you could argue that it is not impossible to
correct the externality of depleting a finite stock of resources, it's not
really done anywhere, and the major price influence is the cost of resource
extraction. This is indeed a major problem, although more of a political one than
a problem with ""the economic system"".

> [30:30] The two productive factors are human capital and human work, and if
> we have these two factors, the supermarket is full of things to buy.

Since Jancovici is using this model to talk about GDP later, it's really a bad
idea to talk only about material goods, because the GDP also contains services,
which don't necessarily require a significant amount of energy (like a doctor
visit, or seeing a play), but okay.

Next, he [shows a simplified version](https://i.imgur.com/Z4UR02n.png) of the
model proposed in the Meadows report ""Limits to Growth"" (that [Solow
called](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/interview-with-robert-solow)
“amateurs making absurd statements about economics” [and doing] “amateur dynamics
without a license, without a proper qualification”) in order to show that
reducing the amount of energy and natural resources reduces the amount of
material goods of the market. I guess this assumes a constant energy/resource
efficiency of the ""productive system"", which Jancovici never mentions, but
I get the general point.

> [36:34] When you look at the world at a whole, the best macroeconomic model
> that I have found so far is a straight line.

Here, he's [showing a regression](https://i.imgur.com/YnzVwHI.png) on [energy
elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_elasticity). This is a very
important point to discuss, but the underlying implication is completely
misleading. He seems to be saying that the elasticity is constant across all
countries. While the elasticity is certainly high for developing countries, it
is certainly not the case in developed economies (Jakob, Haller, Marschinski
2012). Anyway, this elasticity on the global scale is still concerning, so we
can kind of get behind the question.

Side note: 39:33 this is one of the [worst
visualizations](https://i.imgur.com/xasogZO.png) I have ever seen in
my academic life.

Then, he proceeds to painstakingly explain why a decrease in energy will lower
the quantity of material goods, while still completely dismissing the
energy efficiency of the productive system, and the fact that GDP isn't only
about material goods produced. And now, this is where the batshit insane part
begins.

> [44:01] This is the energy supply of Spain.

Wait what? This is the energy *consumption*, it says so at the top of the

But that metric doesn't make sense in the long run! If the productivity of the
system changes with time, the labor/leisure trade-off equilibrium will decrease,
so obviously this curve will show a long term downward slope. And that's not
even accounting for population aging, for a country that is well past its
demographic transition. Looking at the [total number of hours
worked in Spain](https://data.oecd.org/chart/5lak) isn't conclusive but should
give you a clue of how wrong your metric is.

^(EDIT: rereading that, it probably wasn't a good idea to use a metric that includes unemployment to talk about disparities in unemployment metrics, but you get the point)

> [45:49] So there is a very simple way to decrease the rate of unemployment,

Well, that's a good thing right? More leisure for everyone, yeee! How does that
make the metric of the thing you're talking about bad? Also, if that's the main
driver behind the disparity with the actual unemployment curve you're talking
about, then surely that means productivity is *increasing*, right? Since labor
demand fell enough to decrease the labor/leisure trade-off equilibrium, we
produce more with the same amount of work. So why is your story telling the
exact opposite?

Okay, first, you're still doing a regression on the energy *consumption* and
not the energy *availability*. And this is where this talk is becoming a real
trainwreck.

**Jancovici is inverting causality and assumes that GDP is decreasing because
of the lower energy availability, instead of realizing that the energy
consumption decreased BECAUSE of the GDP decrease**. Yeah, you know, after the
fucking [2007-2008 financial
crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008)?

The whole idea of the previous points Jancovici made was that there was a high
elasticity between GDP and energy use. And yeah, in the current state of things
that may very well be right. Energy use is a good indicator of economic
activity (at least the derivatives are), even in developed economies (see
Arora, Lieskovsky 2014 for instance). Instead of using that fact to show that
energy use declined after the crisis, Jancovici is trying to **explain the
financial crisis by a decline in energy availability**.

This is such a horrid causation error. OF COURSE when economic activity goes down, energy use and
jobs go down, why do you have to twist causality in the weirdest way possible?

Also, why are you insisting on the fact that GDP can't go up without the energy
going up, when the graph you put under our noses shows exactly the opposite? I
mean, maybe it's more obvious when you show it [properly represented as a
function of
time](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.COMM.GD.PP.KD?locations=DE-GB-FR-US-ES&name)
but obviously that kinda undermines your whole point because it shows how full
of shit your assumptions are: intensive growth makes energy efficiency
increase, so the energy elasticity *decreases*. (And yeah, I know embedded energy is a thing, but it's not like you can't measure the value of imports).

It seems that Jancovici makes the same causality error in almost every work he
publishes about this issue, see for instance [this google translated article on
his
blog](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fjancovici.com%2Ftransition-energetique%2Fchoix-de-societe%2Flitalie-et-lenergie-un-cas-decole%2F&edit-text=&act=url)
where you can see [this wonderful
graph](https://jancovici.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/italy-energy-GDP.jpg),
and an explanation as to why the causality goes in this way:

> And we see that when the rate of growth of energy falls, the change in GDP
> generally follows from one to two years, which gives credence to the idea
> that when it is the energy that is constrained the GDP is forced to be so as
> a result.

As [doubtful of a methodology](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cell_phones.png)
that is (show me your damn regression), this is not what the graph shows at all. Heck, I can find *more*
variation points on the graph where the shock seems to happen to the GDP before
the energy consumption.

Anyway, then Jancovici proceeds to show the same graphs for Greece (48:10) and
Portugal (48:30), goes on a rant about climate change, fossil fuels and
renewables not being efficient in terms of capital investment compared to
nuclear (which is good! He should do more of those.), then shows a completely
arbitrarily sliced graph (53:59) without providing a convincing regression to
show that somehow the oil shocks provoked the decline of annual growth, without
ever showing the actual oil supply or mentioning the fact that the EU economy
is slowly pivoting towards intensive growth and away from extensive growth, because of
the [decline in population
growth](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.GROW?locations=EU).

And now (56:06) comes the best demonstration of the talk.

> Jobs = Jobs. I divide and multiply the Jobs by the GDP. [...] I have created
> an indicator which is how many jobs can I put into one unit of GDP. [...] If
> I increase wages, this term decreases

What does that even *mean*? If you increase wages by some exogenous process, you
grow the economy by that factor (well, [to some extent](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/3cp9vu/longrun_growth_is_the_keynesian_cross/)).

> So the less money people earn for a given GDP, the larger number of jobs I
> can put into the same GDP. Which is the history of negotiation of wages

At that point of the talk I'm not sure how Jancovici is able to talk about
market power in the labour market using an equation that boils down to 1 = 1 in
one of the most prestigious schools of France without anyone in the audience
throwing a pair of shoes at him, but anyway.

You might think that some of those terms simplify to give something
interesting, but no, it just [sinks into more
insanity](https://i.imgur.com/AJ2B7AI.png).

The end of the talk is about climate change, and while he makes a lot of bad
assumptions about the constancy of energy elasticity, never mentions that growth
is correlated to energy efficiency improvement and seems to generally imply that
growth is killing the planet, he's not entirely wrong that the elasticity is a
concern and

Politics has been dominated by culture wars and the personality of Donald Trump: economic policy has become increasingly absent. And where there is no economics at all, how can we find bad economics? Are the golden days of Ron Paul and his ilk never to be seen again?

Fear not my friends, for we have been given unto us a messiah. His name is RFK Jr and he's running for president. 

Probably, you're already familiar with him because of his various conspiracy views. For those not aware, he runs a [crank medical organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Health_Defense) that's worried about vaccines and fluoride and all that jazz. His organization [seems to think](https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/7/142) that the covid vaccine contains tracking chips with cryptocurrency features that will enable the Fed to do something or other with digital dollars. He's worried about 5g and [iPhone radiation](https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1702798352763818136) and how it all interacts with vaccines. Where you read ""covid"" he reads ""[\(\(\(covid\)\)\)](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/15/us/politics/rfk-jr-remarks-covid.html)"".

You get the picture. But we're not here for that. We're here for economic policy. What's he got in the tank for *that*?

Well, he's running for president. Might as well start with his economic platform. Because baby, [he's got a 14 point plan](https://www.kennedy24.com/economy)! I wonder if he chose 14 on purpose. I digress.

The shining highlight of this list is this thing of beauty right here:

> Drop housing costs by $1000 per family and make home ownership affordable by backing 3% home mortgages with tax-free bonds.

He [likes to talk about this one on twitter](https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1707799442420887835) as well. Ain't it a doozy? The RI for this is actually already available, [sitting on the shelf](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/126r84u/just_subsidize_demand/). 

In fairness, he apparently [does want to legalize ADUs](https://www.kennedy24.com/housing). So I guess things could be worse. But I'd argue that the upshot of legalizing ADUs is offset by this ominous business on that page about trying to engineer the tax code to prevent corporations from buying single family homes. 

What else do we have in this platform? Oddly, it's not all bad (not that we are here to look at the bright spots). I'd say the home mortgage thing is probably at the frontier of (bad economics, novel and interesting). There are worse policies in there, of course, but mostly we've seen it all before. Bog standard protectionism, basically. For example, *Cut energy prices by restricting natural gas exports.* Or: *Negotiate trade deals that prevent low-wage countries from competing with American workers in a “race to the bottom.”* And: *Secure the border and bring illegal immigration to a halt.*

You get the picture. He also blends some of his crankery into the platform. He has something about establishing ""addiction healing centers on organic farms"" and about expanding access to ""low-cost alternative and holistic therapies"" in the healthcare system. 

In terms of other content in his platform, I'll cover a few minor highlights. Everything that follows is from the economy page of his website, unless an additional link is given:

> Support small businesses by redirecting regulatory scrutiny onto large corporations. [[...](https://www.kennedy24.com/revitalization)] We will enact policies that favor small and medium businesses, which are the nation’s real job creators and the dynamos of American enterprise.

This 'small is beautiful' mindset really seems to infect a lot of people. But it's not clear we really should want to favor them.

For one, it doesn't really seem to be true that small and medium businesses are the nation's ""real job creators"". It's based on a long standing misconception: it's not really business size that seems to matter for job creation, but rather [business age](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c13492/revisions/c13492.rev4.pdf). Basically, new companies tend to grow like gangbusters or go bankrupt. Young startups with lots of job creation in their future do start small - hence you might mistakenly thing it's size, not age, that matters. But once a small business gets to be a little long in the tooth, to a first approximation, it doesn't have much job creation in its future. 

For two, mom and pop shops kind of suck to work at. Big companies are large and efficient. They often are more productive and better managed than mom and pop shops. [They pay better](https://www.nber.org/papers/w20313). Mom and pop shops are also notorious for being worse when it comes to minimum wage compliance to workplace safety rules to workplace harassment. Big companies know they're a target large enough to be worth suing or pursuing enforcement actions against, and have institutions within them dedicated to handling those issues. Small businesses generally aren't big enough to be worth targeting and generally don't have such institutions. Moreover, if you run your own micro business, you have some folks that just like running them as petty tyrants. So it really isn't clear to me that we should particularly promotes small businesses over large businesses. And promoting them by loosening regulatory scrutiny of them even further is a bit perverse.

As for the final ""dynamos of American enterprise"" remark. You could interpret this many ways. I would just note that it seems unlikely that small firms would be all that good at innovation and R&D outside of certain special cases. My hunch [seems to be correct on average](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268121005163).

I'd add that overall, he is big on this mom and pop vs large company thing. He's got some blast from the past type ""let's be worried about walmart driving out local grocery store"" type [content on twitter](https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1695093304830902276), for example. This is an ancient debate at this point, but 10 years ago there were some papers about this and the bottom line seems to be consistent with big box entry [being good for consumer welfare](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24750). 


> Expand free childcare to millions of families.

Not much to say here beyond: good luck finding the labor without immigration or gains from trade with low wage countries.


> Make student debt dischargeable in bankruptcy and cut interest rates on student loans to zero.

This is a fun one, because assessing it is impossible without understanding the intent of the policy. I have heard schemes to make student debt dischargeable in bankruptcy, but to transfer the debt back to the university or college if that happens. I actually think that's not a terrible idea, provided it's implemented intelligently, and would push us toward an equilibrium where schools are less keen to enroll people in negative return degrees. On the other hand, if they skip the university liability part, this would just turn out to be free college through the backdoor, so, not so genius.

> Cut drug costs by half to bring them in line with other nations.

When other people propose this kind of thing, I generally imagine that they just aren't thinking about possible impacts on pharmaceutical research and development. But in RFK's case, I suppose that may be the point. If I thought pharmaceutical R&D was mainly focused on manufacturing mind control devices and new autism delivery mechanisms, I guess I would want to tamp down on it as well...


>People always ask, “How are we going to pay for all this?” The answer is simple. First is to end the military adventures and regime-change wars, like the one in Ukraine. The wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Libya already cost us over $8 trillion. That’s $90,000 per family of four. That’s enough to pay off all medical debt, all credit card debt, provide free childcare, feed every hungry child, repair our infrastructure, and make college tuition free – with money left over. That’s enough to make social security solvent for another 30 years. 


This is another great one. He'll fund his various schemes by spending the sunk costs from W Bush's wars? Genius stuff. I suppose we could cut off Ukraine; if we did that upfront, we'd have saved [all of 75 billion dollars](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-aid-has-us-sent-ukraine-here-are-six-charts), much of the value of which was in the form of in kind transfers in aging equipment. I'm sure that'll go real far. (If we were r/badgeopolitics, I'd have more yet to say about. But alas.) 


> *[Continuing the pay-for discussion.]* Second is to end the corruption in Washington, the corporate giveaways, the boondoggles, the bailouts of the too-big-to-fail that leave the little guy at the mercy of the market. Corporations right now are sitting on $8 trillion in cash. Their contribution to tax revenues was 33% in the 1950s – it is 10% today. It’s high time they paid their fair share. 

The too big to fail bailouts! Normie hatred of our efforts to save us from a second great depression in 2008 will never burn out, will it? I guess you can read this as wanting to triple the corporate tax rate as well. Nothing like some good ol fashioned double marginalization to close your budget holes. 


------

At any rate, I think it's clear that Mr. Kennedy has potential. This little platform of his is a nice starting point. And there is plenty of reason to hope for me. Like I said, he's running and it doesn't look like he's likely to slink away anytime soon. And he isn't shy about broaching various policies issues on his twitter, in his own way. You only get breadcrumbs, really, but you get occasional gems, like his plan to ban fracking to [discourage plastics production](https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1702705913076019352). And you get some classic treats: for example, he reads [zerohedge on inflation](https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1695127888809328953).

This article lays out a ""beginner's guide to MMT"".  I know we're tired of MMT but here is a great resource for people to use to understand MMT before criticizing them (if you think there are criticisms to be made).

RI:

>A good place to start is with a simple description that you can carry in your pocket: MMT proposes that a country with its own currency, such as the U.S., doesn’t have to worry about accumulating too much debt because it can always print more money to pay interest. So the only constraint on spending is inflation, which can break out if the public and private sectors spend too much at the same time. As long as there are enough workers and equipment to meet growing demand without igniting inflation, the government can spend what it needs to maintain employment and achieve goals such as halting climate change.

There is so much to unpack in the first paragraph (following the first through throat clearing paragraphs).  So many assumptions that aren't written out to fully vet and see if they're reasonable assumptions (perhaps because we lack a model?).  

>MMT proposes that a country with its own currency, such as the U.S., doesn’t have to worry about accumulating too much debt because it can always print more money to pay interest.

""Doesn't have to worry"".  What does this mean? What, in MMT's minds, are the relevant tradeoffs, the relevant welfare considerations, of having high deficits?  This is not clear, aside from the inflation consideration.

Debt is raised from capital markets from investors.  The government auctions bonds and takes money out of capital markets.  That means government debt ""crowds out"" private investment.  Is this something we don't need to worry about?

>So the only constraint on spending is inflation, which can break out if the public and private sectors spend too much at the same time.

This isn't really a ""constraint"", but rather a policy consideration. They're proposing a dual mandate, more-or-less.  This illuminates one of the tradeoffs they think matter.

You can't R1 normative positions, but this is still an important thing to understand.

>As long as there are enough workers and equipment to meet growing demand without igniting inflation, the government can spend what it needs to maintain employment and achieve goals 

This, I think, is where we can unpack the MMT model, which is badeconomics.  It is badeconomics because it assumes that money is non-neutral.

This is my parsimonious model:

https://imgur.com/tKHI3uX

Seignorage financed deficit spending increases aggregate demand.  The objective of government policy is to regulate aggregate demand such that AD2 = AS at Y\*, as the free market (Y = Laissez-faire) will be perpetually below potential.  Y\* is potential output, which is where full employment exists.  Inflation (higher price level) occurs here because too much money is chasing too few goods.

Deficit spending increasing aggregate demand is normal in AD/AS comparative statics.  However, what is different here is the implicit belief behind seignorage: money printing doesn't cause inflation.  Money neutrality states that printing money cannot move around real resources (shifting AD to where AD = Y\*) in the long run, it only increases nominal prices.  

MMT would be *correct* if money neutrality was wrong.  However, strong theory as well as strong evidence in the international cross-section suggests that money neutrality is an accurate description of reality.  This makes MMT wrong, and makes it badeconomics.

>On March 13 the University of Chicago Booth School of Business published a [survey of prominent economists](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/modern-monetary-theory) that misrepresented MMT that way, leaving out its understanding that too-big deficits can cause excessive inflation. The surveyed professors roundly disagreed with MMT as described. MMTers cried foul.

Going back to my parsimonious model, it relies on question 2 of the survey: *""Countries that borrow in their own currency can finance as much real government spending as they want by creating money.""*  This is the heart of MMT, not ""deficits don't matter"".  While there are many great responses to this question, Darrell Duffie wrote the best response:

>If this were true, each such country could finance the purchase of all of the world's output, which is obviously impossible.

Real government spending cannot be financed through seignorage forever; it manifests itself in higher inflation not increased material wealth.

If MMT can show that money printing does *not* lead to higher inflation, then MMT would have a leg to stand on.

Going back a bit:

>the government can spend what it needs to maintain employment 

Another argument made by MMTers is that a lassiez-faire economy will not employ everyone who wants a job.  They argue that a ""natural unemployment rate"" (defined as the unemployment rate at which there exists only frictional unemployment caused by things like job search) isn't real. If the government doesn't step in to employ people, then there will be a persistent gap between potential and actual output, which means we'll be persistently poorer as a society.  I don't think that MMTers have a grasp on how economists think about labor markets; that being said I have a rudimentary understanding of labor markets and won't go further here.

>MMT rejects the modern consensus that economies should be steered primarily by the raising and lowering of interest rates. MMTers believe that the natural rate of interest in a world of fiat money is zero and that pegging it higher is a giveaway to the investor class.

There is no definition of the natural interest rate provided.  It would be helpful if MMTers wrote down what they mean by the natural rate.  I will use ""natural rate"" to mean ""the rate of interest which arises when loanable funds/capital markets clear"".  The natural interest rate is an equilibrium price.  Going back, MMT argues that money is non-neutral.  If money is non-neutral the government *can* peg interest rates to zero.  We know - both empirically and through *super intuitive theory* - that money is non-neutral.  Friedman (1968) goes over why you can't peg interest rates at zero as higher rates manifest themselves through the Fisher Effect.  High interest rates tends to coincide with high inflation (Mishkin 1992).

Why is it the case that MMTers think that we should peg the interest rate at zero?  Do they see that returns to capital investment is pure rents?  ""The investor class"" is a vague and ambiguous concept; if you own a savings account, then the interest rate impacts your savings account returns - does this make you the equivalent of some evil fat cat Wall Street person?

>They say tweaking interest rates is ineffectual because businesses make investment decisions based on prospects for growth, not the cost of money.

This is mindboggling bad economic theory.  Firms will execute projects where the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost.  The Net Present Value (benefit) of a project is increasing in cash flows (""prospects for growth"") and decreasing in the discount (interest) rate.  Furthermore, this argument displays a lack of thinking on the margin.  Lastly, interest rates are not the price (cost) of money.  The price of money is 1/Price Level.  The interest rate is the price of loanable funds/capital.

>MMTers argue that economies should be guided by fiscal policy—government spending and taxation. They want a nation’s central bank to do the bidding of its treasury. So when the treasury needs money, the central bank accommodates it with a keystroke—creating base money from thin air by crediting the treasury’s checking account. The new textbook says that today, governments “tend to run unduly restrictive fiscal policy stances so as not to contradict the monetary policy stance.”

As I've said before, MMT is not a new paradigm of macroeconomic thought.  It is a collection of Old Keynesian policy prescriptions, and here is a prime example of that plain and simple.  In reality governments spend and the Fed reacts (conventional economic thought).  The actions are near simultaneous so it looks as if the fiscal authority is subservient to the Fed but this isn't true.  An example is the Tax Cut and Jobs Act that Trump and Republicans passed recently.  The fiscal authority instituted a large deficit financed tax cut, and the Fed reacted by raising rates.

>MMT challenges a core principle of conventional economics, which is that an increase in budget deficits will tend to raise interest rates, all else equal.

There are a few ways to connect increased deficits and increased interest rates.  The one channel is where capital markets charge higher interest rates at bond auctions when the government (which represents the demand side of the market) wants to buy a lot of capital (sell a lot of bonds).  Cet. par., higher demand means higher prices and interest rates are the price of capital/loanable funds (see above).  Alternatively, higher deficits cause higher demand and the Fed reacts to increased demand by raising rates to keep inflation on target (assuming more deficit spending puts us on a trajectory to higher inflation anyway).

>In MMT’s ideal world there would still be taxes, but their main purpose, aside from lessening inequality, would be as “offsets” to keep inflation under control. Taxes would drain just enough money from consumers and businesses so total spending in the economy won’t be excessive.

Notably missing from this suggestion is an analysis of optimal taxes.  Apparently incentives or deadweight loss doesn't matter here, as taxes would be levied only to lower spending.

>MMTers hold that inflation isn’t primarily the result of excessively strong growth. They blame much of it on businesses’ excessive pricing power. So before trying to choke off growth to kill inflation, they would try to break up monopolies and stop banks from making too many loans.

This is also bad economics.  Inflation is by definition an increase in the *price level*.  Monopoly power should show up in *relative* prices (the prices you get out of your supply/demand graphs either in perfect competition, monopoly, etc).  Breaking up monopolies would lower *relative prices* (an admirable goal!) but would not lower *inflation* which is a rise in nominal prices.

>Mainstream economists argue that the correct parts of MMT aren’t new and the new parts aren’t correct. But MMTers point out that the establishment hasn’t covered itself in glory in recent years—largely failing to foresee the global financial crisis a decade ago, for instance. 

It is astounding that MMTers are pulling the ""economists didn't see the financial crisis coming"" card.  Neither did MMTers!  This is nothing but an appeal to the populists that give you a soap box.  I don't think I need to point that this doesn't prove MMT is correct, nor does it show that macroeconomics is wrong.

---

Overall, this article displays bad economic thinking on a few levels.  However, we can cut to the core of MMT by thinking about money neutrality and whether or not seignorage can finance real government spending.  If long-run money neutrality is incorrect (and that a laissez-faire economy can't achieve full employment) then MMT observations about the real world are correct and policy makers should shift their thinking.  I do not think that this is the case as both theory and evidence suggest otherwise.  I await an MMT model and a regression to estimate.",wumbotarian,t2_cazkr,0.96,201,154

First a disclaimer that this is only sort of bad economics.  It's more misunderstanding of the legal regime underlying U.S. antitrust policy with the occasional bad economics thrown in.

I'll focus on the first two points mostly because honestly most of the others are only tangentially economics.  That being said, where there is economic content that I think is wrong I will point it out.   

> Myth #1: ""Big Tech companies are monopolies""

The core problem with this line is his definition of the relevant market.  The way we do this in the US is through a principle called the [*Hypothetical Monopolist Test*](https://www.justice.gov/atr/operationalizing-hypothetical-monopolist-test).  The core of the test is based around the idea of substitutability: it's essentially asking the question what is the smallest possible product market over which it would be profitable for a hypothetical monopolist to raise a price significantly.  Significantly here is given in terms of the SSNIP, the small but significant and non-transitory increase in price.  That is the relevant antitrust market.  

To give credit where it's due, he definitely understands that substitutability is the core of what matters!  But he does get pulled a little bit off course as well, writing things like: 

> Critics of big tech often try to define arbitrarily narrow markets to show a market share in excess of two thirds... If anything the simultaneous  rise and fall of print advertising -- while other advertising channels have remained intact -- suggests that 'US digital advertising is too narrow of a market.  It seems that users are substituting digital advertising for print advertising.

The problem with this is that the question is as to the current substitutability  of digital and print advertising.  That one went down and the other up at the same time is not sufficient evidence that the two are substitutes going forward.  To see why, consider a question of how customers would respond if a single firm monopolized the digital advertising space *but not the print advertising space*.  How would the customers respond?  For the two distinct products to lie in the same market, the diversion from the digital advertising space to print would have to be so large as to make the price increase unprofitable, and that *ex ante* seems a dubious proposition.  The rise in digital advertising and the decline of print were driven by the same force (the decline of print media and the rise of digital media/the internet), but note that in that case the advertising followed the readers, and that's really what drove the dynamic.  A change in the relative prices now doesn't really undo that, so I'm skeptical that they are still substitutes.  Of course, as with everything this is an empirical question.  

>Myth #2: ""Big Tech harms consumers""

Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.  Alec here rightly points out that the consumer welfare standard is what governs antitrust in the US.  But the consumer welfare standard does not just refer to prices!  Pointing out that prices are zero or falling is wrong on two fronts: 1)it ignores the counterfactual (i.e. would prices have fallen more), and 2)it ignores the bulk of the antitrust criticisms of big tech.  Some of these criticisms are of the flavor that big is (inherently) bad.  These tend not to be very convincing.  But there are some very specific criticisms that are substantially more likely.  

For instance, one of the big things that antitrust regulators are grappling with right now is with regards to Amazon basics (it's in-house brand).  The concern is essentially that Amazon, since it owns both the market and a participant in the market can use its marketplace power to incentivize people to buy its own products at the expense of competitors.  Often times people here are concerned about things that Amazon could do to the other sellers (e.g. require them to pay large entry fees, reducing the attractiveness of entry by raising the initial fixed costs).  More insidiously, one of the concerns is that threat of amazon doing this could, itself, disincentivize entry.  Note that this kind of long-run dynamic effect is inherently hard to estimate because you are trying to model how amazon's market power affects the creation of firms far in the future.^1 

> Myth #3: ""Big Tech doesn't innovate""

Setting aside the obvious problems with using R&D spending as a measure of innovation, I think there is a philosophical problem with this point.  Let's think about a merger between two companies X and Y.  The question that Alec would have us ask implicitly is, do X and Y have less of an incentive to innovate after the merger.  But that's not ultimately what antitrust regulators are concerned about.  The question to them is, will the markets that X and Y are in be less innovative after the merger?  The answers to the two questions often coincide (particularly in horizontal mergers) but not always in vertical ones.  To be fair, I don't think Alec was trying to make this point but I think it's something that a lot of people probably would've thought after seeing it.  

> Myth #4: ""Network effects make Big Tech unbeatable"" 

Alec here is right in that breaking up the big tech companies would almost surely harm consumers.  Network effects matter quite a bit!  It's not clear to me why he thinks network effects work in reverse.  The nature of big networks is that its relatively costly for new entrants not to be on the network, so it's hard to get rid of them.  If someone has relevant cites/wants to tell me I'm wrong, happy to hear it though.

> Myth #5: ""Big Tech is killing the startup ecosystem"" 

This is a time series of VC investment, but the relevant question is what is VC spending in the absence of the big tech companies, which the stated graph does nothing to address.  

> Myth #6: ""Big Tech companies only compete in one market""

They do compete against each other a lot of the time, but again, need to be careful with market definition here.  

I don't really care about the other ones other than:

> Myth #10: ""It was obvious that some Big Tech acquisitions were anticompetitive""

Alec is absolutely 100% right here.  Regulators do the best they can and ultimately it's often not easy to tell.  Retroactive policing is also very hard under the current legal regime (although not just because of the legal regime, scrambled eggs are a problem too).  

I think, ultimately Alec's implicit conclusion that it would be unwise to break up big tech is right, but it does no one any favors by making sloppy arguments about it.  Amazon in particular is a bit of a thorny problem with Amazon Basics (you'll note that one of the two theories of harm is really just a pretty bog standard RRC theory of harm a la e.g. [Crawford et al. 2018](https://web.stanford.edu/~ayurukog/ECTA14031.pdf)).  The policy implication, if you buy the long-run entry theory of harm is of course that you need to separate Amazon the marketplace from Amazon the provider (preferably via a behavioural remedy I think).  

^1 To be clear, I'm not sure I buy this, but pointing to historical price series is typically not well-regarded by practitioners, since the nature of antitrust is that it is forward looking, not backwards.",Hypers0nic,t2_fp61x,0.94,163,41
892,f3coz1,2020-02-13,badeconomics,Pulling out a benchmark isn't enough; you need to use a control group.,"There was a recent [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2759843) in JAMA Network Open purporting to find a six-percentage-point increase in employment or education enrollment (54.3% to 60%) among enrollees in Michigan's Medicaid expansion.

I posted about this in [the 'burbs](https://old.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/ex1f31/the_single_family_homes_sticky_31_january_2020/fg5utyj/) a while back, but having thought about it some more and growing more confident in my understanding of exactly what went wrong here, I'm giving it the full RI treatment.

The TL;DR of the methodology is that the authors collected a sample of people in the Healthy Michigan Plan (Michican's Medicaid expansion), found out how many were in employment or education (54.3%) as of January 2017, and then followed up with them a year later. At follow-up, 60.0% were in employment or education.

Because enrollment wasn't randomized, they didn't have a control group. As an alternative, they benchmarked this result to the overall employment or education rate (henceforth EER) of Michigan residents age 19-64 (increased 74% to 75%; somehow p=0.64, which I suspect is a whole other RI), and to the EER of Michigan's low-income residents 19-64 (42.7% to 43.0%).

These findings are extremely suspicious for a few reasons:

* The Oregon Medicaid study, which used a randomized control, found no effect on employment or earnings.
* Despite a six-percentage-point increase in the EER among a huge chunk of Michigan's low-income adult population, there was virtually no increase in the overall EER of Michigan's low-income adult population.
* The result doesn't seem to have been mediated by treatment of chronic health problems; the EER increase among participants with chronic health problems was the same as among those without chronic health problems.

So what's going on here? Well, it turns out that the methodology used in this study virtually guarantees a spurious finding of a positive employment effect.

The fundamental problem is the lack of a proper control group. Benchmarking to the employment rate of the adult population, or even the low-income adult population\*, is not a valid control, because these only reflect net changes in employment, while failing to account for individual turnover in the unemployed population.

The primary determinant of eligibility for Medicaid/HMP enrollment is low income. A common cause of low income in a given calendar year is unemployment for part or all of that year; hence the 54.3% EER among participants in the initial survey, compared to 74% in the general adult population. Unemployment and labor force nonparticipation are often temporary. A person may have a spell of bad luck and be unemployed for several months, and then find a job. A person may leave the labor force to take care of a family member, and then return. A person may suffer a temporary disability, recover, and return to the labor force. Although I'm usually quite gainfully employed, I myself was voluntarily out of the labor force in 2011, earning no money and thus falling below the poverty line.

Consequently, a sample of low-income individuals will likely contain many individuals who are only temporarily unemployed. Even if no intervention (such as Medicaid enrollment) is applied, it is likely that we will find, upon follow-up a year later, that many of them have found jobs. Some will have lost jobs as well, of course, but since a sample of low-income individuals oversamples the temporarily unemployed, we should expect to see a net increase in employment among the sample, even if the overall employment rate remains unchanged.

I'm fairly confident that explains most, if not all, of the positive EER effect found here. Theoretically it could explain more than 100%, and the true causal effect could be negative. I appreciate the difficulty of finding a proper control group under these circumstances, but the benchmarking approach here is a woefully inadequate substitute, and virtually guarantees a spurious positive employment effect due to turnover in unemployment as described above. Without a proper control group, these findings cannot be interpreted as evidence for a positive employment effect.

-------------

\* Incidentally, the employment rate among the low-income population is particularly difficult to interpret because the low-income population is in large part defined by lack of employment: A person who is unemployed for most or all of a calendar year will likely have low income in that calendar year. If employed year-round in the following year, the worker may cease to be classified as low-income, and thus fail to increase the employment rate among the low-income population. Paradoxically, a low employment rate among the low-income population can be a sign of a strong economy: If wages are high enough to keep the vast majority of workers above the low-income threshold, then relatively few individuals below the low-income threshold will be employed. As such, the employment rate for low-income individuals should never be used in the manner in which it is used here.",brberg,t2_fdq0n,0.97,107,17

> although economists have historically wanted their field to be associated with the so-called hard sciences – a conjuring act exemplified by the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences

I'm not sure how having a Nobel Prize associates a field with the hard sciences - there are Nobel Prizes in Peace and Literature and nobody claims they are hard sciences. Or maybe Ms. Benack is referring to the ""Economic *Sciences*"" part of the official name? In any case, I'll have more to say about economic methodology later.

> Unlike economics, which deals with human relationships, the hard sciences study phenomena in the natural world.

Human relationships *are* phenomena in the natural world. I don't see how the study of animal behaviour can be a hard science, but not the study of human behaviour (although the latter is definitely much more challenging).

> As such, a claim by a natural scientist reflects a different kind of truth than one by an economist. For example, the law of gravity describes an immutable physical fact; the law of supply and demand describes a relationship between people.

Not everyone who is in contact with someone infected with a virus will catch it, and everyone who catches it will react differently: so, immunology is not a hard science? Because it doesn't describe ""immutable physical facts"", it seems.

> What we know as mainstream economics today began with the concept of marginal utility

The father of economics is generally considered to be Adam Smith, who certainly never spoke about marginal utility. The father of macroeconomics is Keynes, who also didn't speak much about marginal utility (although he was certainly familiar with the concept). Arguably, marginal utility is an important concept in microeconomics, but microeconomics was not born from the concept of marginal utility, it was born from marginalism generally speaking.

> The concept of marginal utility allowed economists to turn sensations into quantities. Happiness was imagined as a pile of many little units of pleasure, which some economists actually believed could be physically measured.

I don't think any economist today believes happiness can be measured. Ms. Benack is attacking a strawman.

> Models of economic theory require this same suspension of disbelief. We know that there is no world with perfect competition, as one famous economic theory asserts, so we’re asked to set aside the criteria we would usually apply to understand something as objectively real to follow the story the theory – and economist – tells about the economy.

We also know that Newtonian physics don't apply to the real world. That doesn't prevent it from being useful. In fact, there is no complete theory of physics, or any other field, yet. I don't see how having imprecise theories about the world prevents an academic field from being a (hard) science.

> This reliance on our attitude toward fiction is not exclusive to the models used in economics. The same could be said about, for example, the idea of a perfect vacuum in physics. We know there is no perfectly empty space, yet we can imagine it.

So she *is* aware her argument doesn't hold water.

> According to economic texbooks, individuals make choices by considering how much happiness they derive from different options. Say I have an hour I could use to either buy groceries, catch up with a friend, or take a nap. I assess my options and find that grocery shopping is not that important right now, seeing my friend would be nice, but napping really promises the largest amount of happiness.

Reasonably good description of how opportunity cost works.

> Consequently, I choose to nap, but the price I pay for my nap is the happiness I would have derived from my second-best option, spending time with my friend. Note that this second-best option did not and will not occur, and the individual in this story knows this as she is imagining her options.

So far, so good.

> In other words, fiction occupies a very prominent position in the opportunity cost story, and, by extension, in economics at large. Each decision we make, economists are saying, is accompanied by a piece of fiction.

Wait, what? Just because a certain concept in economics relies on counterfactuals, this means economics as a field is a fiction? That's like saying that because thermodynamics relies on randomness, thermodynamics itself is random. There can be precise laws about random facts; there can be real laws involving counterfactuals.",smalleconomist,t2_1kuf7f,0.97,281,156
894,mtrbzk,2021-04-19,badeconomics,[Low-hanging fruit] Tumblr post screencapped on instagram doesn't know the difference between gross and net profit.,"I came across this instagram post from some random page that the all-powerful algorithm gods decided to show me: https://imgur.com/a/fLVwEje

(there was some additional content about health insurance which I can’t comment on). 

Their claim boils down to “Walmart can easily afford the minimum wage, it’s a tiny fraction of their profits to pay everyone another 7.25$ per hour.”

The first thing you may notice is the calculation at the top of the second image. 1.5 million employees, another 7.5 dollars per hour, 40 hours per week, all good… and that’s it. 4.35 billion dollars is the *weekly* cost. This number is then compared to Walmart’s *annual* profits. That clearly isn’t going to be very useful! So the estimated 3.3% of profit is off by a factor of 50 (assuming 2 weeks vacation); this mistake alone means that the correct result of this estimate would be 165%, or over one and a half times all of Walmart’s profit. 

The second thing you may notice is the very high profit. Walmart is known for being a high-volume, low-price company in an industry (retail) with generally low margins. Walmart’s revenue in 2019 was about [$514 billion](https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2019/05/16/walmart-releases-q1-fy20-earnings), which means this post is asserting Walmart’s profit margin was over 25% in 2019! The post mentions this is their gross profit, which is [“the profit a company makes after deducting the costs associated with making and selling its products”](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossprofit.asp). In particular, fixed costs are excluded, so we are totally ignoring rent, certain salaries, advertising, and other major costs. Clearly, we can’t use this number to determine if Walmart can afford a 15$ minimum wage or not. Instead, let’s use net profit (or net income), which [includes all costs](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101314/what-are-differences-between-gross-profit-and-net-income.asp). Walmart’s net income in [2019](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/WMT/financials/annual/income-statement) was about 6.7 billion dollars. By this calculation, a 15$ MW would cost Walmart over 30 times their annual profits. 

(To make it even weirder, contradicting the post itself, the caption says ""And that's net profits, after all the costs of running the business."")

Is the actual cost that high? Almost certainly not. The post made the assumption that all of Walmart’s 1.5 million US employees currently make minimum wage, which is not correct; any employees already making over MW will decrease the marginal cost of a higher minimum wage. 2019 appears to be a [low point](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/WMT/walmart/net-profit-margin) for Walmart’s net profit. And Walmart could probably replace some labor costs with capital, like investing in more self-checkout stations, or just reduce costs flat-out by closing stores. How much would it *actually* cost them? Possibly very little. [This](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/walmart-pledges-to-raise-wages-to-15-per-hour) says their average wage is already 14$ per hour, and they will be increasing it to over 15$ in the future.

Here, Bellamy makes the basic mistake of thinking that endless e-e-e-economic growth
means endless energy growth. While there's no denying that all e-e-e-economic
activity and technological p-p-p-processes requires some amount of energy, it
is a mistake to think that growth requires always more TTTenergy. Economic growth
is a measure of the increcrecre-crreases of value of goods and services, but
more value doesn't necessarily require more energy consumption.

Indeed, technological p-p-p-p-progress makes it possible to produce more va̺͓̹lụ̱̟̣̮ḙ̥̟̝̠

I wanted something a bit different from the standard fare R1'ed here.

Congratulations to /u/gorbachev for their [winning post](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/3xml8s/holiday_contest_r1off/cy6ihmg).  You are a winner of [this](https://www.etsy.com/listing/199813479/funny-economist-t-shirt-mba-student?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping_us_all_products-low&utm_custom1=2c2fdbdf-e1ca-4a83-8b0d-b915ee0e6eff&gclid=CjwKEAiA2IO0BRDXmLndksSB0WgSJADNKqqoRx7hJNUzuOgaU9JccGzIDMdbdpAoZNP1wp0W04Ar2BoCJJPw_wcB)

So, here's what I had written up about this paper, in no particular order

* Standard errors are clearly wrong.  Observations are correlated based on their order and store(both employee and observer).  You can think of the errors based on order correlation as something akin to an AR-1 process.
* Conditional upon ordering a fancy drink, If women order such with extras like no whip with soy and men do not, then the model suffers from omitted variables bias.  The fact that there is no difference in magnitude (or significance) for non-fancy drinks suggests this might be the case.
* The study design lacks an ability to control for many unobservables.  For example, they could have sent the same person in to order the exact same drink following the same 'script'.  Noisy data in, noisy estimates out.
* Lack of economic significance.  This is a common failing of many papers across all fields of study.  Suppose women do wait for their coffee 30 seconds more than men, controlling for a host of factors and assuming that this extra time does not produce a positive, non-monetary benefit.  So what?  What's the economic effect then?  Is it a few cents of utility loss?  Good studies have meaningful economic effects that are easily described in their abstract.

Thoughts?  Would you like to see this again?

897,4yy0l3,2016-08-22,badeconomics,"Eugenics, Malthusianism, and the Tragedy of the Commons","First post, be gentle, only doing this for shitposting privileges, yada yada.

This is adapted from something I'm actually using for school, so it may come off as a bit formal.

http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html

**Tl;dr of the article:**

Hardin’s central point is that we must implement a system of eugenics. He describes our world as finite and zero-sum, and thus follows to that point that as world population increases, each person’s “per capita share of the world's goods must steadily decrease.”

In breeding, Hardin insists, we see a tragedy of the commons, where each person gains the most individually by producing more children, although humanity as a whole loses the more people are born. In order to “deal with the family, the religion, the race, or the class (or indeed any distinguishable and cohesive group) that adopts overbreeding as a policy to secure its own aggrandizement,” Hardin suggests we implement a system of “mutual coercion mutually agreed upon,” in essence, of laws, that limit breeding. He argues that the right to reproductive autonomy should be fundamentally discarded, as lowering the growth of population is so desirable that it amount to creating more freedom. 

Hardin posits that humanity has restricted freedom and closed several “commons” in a similar way throughout history, namely in the creation of property rights, which closed the commons of land, and in the restriction of pollution, which closed the commons of air and water.


**My R1:**

Hardin’s argument is flawed in several ways in both theory and implementation.

Let’s examine Hardin’s central claim that as population increases, “the per capita share of the world's goods must steadily decrease,” and thus greater populations lead to led happy people. Let’s consider the opposite extreme, then: imagine that everyone in the world were to disappear save for a single person. They would have ownership of all resources, so according to Hardin, they must be ultimately happy. In reality, however, this would be a nightmare, as no single person is able to maintain the infrastructure of the modern world, and most people would be lucky to just be able to find enough food to feed themselves every day in this scenario.

The flaw in Hardin’s reasoning is a inability to distinguish the quantity of resources available from quantity of utility available (utility here meaning the use, or happiness, a person derives from available resources). While resources are finite, utility is not. Imagine, for example, that an engine was invented that could produce twice the gas mileage-- twice the energy-- of any other car engine, while being just as expensive as any other motor. Humanity would double the utility it can get out of its gas reserves without those gas reserves changing in quantity.

If we look trends historically, we see greater populations actually having more utility per capita. The average American enjoys a higher standard of living than the average medieval peasant, who in turn is better off than the average Babylonian slave. Technology plays an important part in this, but larger populations also enabled greater specialization of individuals, which creates greater utility overall. While it may sound reasonable at first, there’s no reason to believe that greater populations lead to reduced utility per person.

Beyond that, Hardin’s ideas would be nearly impossible to implement. Look at the previous examples he gives of other “closings of the commons.” The first, the enclosure of private property, can hardly be said to exist as a distinct historical event, but it was almost certainly enforced by violence and territorial war. Environmental regulation was obviously not a violent process, but that was because the bulk of the restrictions were applied to corporations, and the practical freedom of the individual was infringed only by litter laws at worst. It’s hard to see the body politic relinquishing their rights to free reproduction-- along with the freedom to privacy and biological autonomy that would be needed to enforce it-- when there’s no real precedent. Even the historical laws that sought to place similar restrictions were entirely impossible to enforce. Such rights are so fundamental to humanity as a whole that any program of reform that truly sought to both implement and enforce Hardin’s regulations must be necessarily violent, invasive, and brutal.

The other problem with giving the government control of such a fundamental part of human life is that such power would almost definitely be wielded in a discriminatory way. The concept of “mutual coercion mutually agreed upon” provides no guarantee of fairness. Because we can’t expect every person to “mutually agree” to coercion, we must instead revert to majority rule. Majority rule, however, can become tyranny by majority, as the majority creates laws that benefit it at the expense of racial, religious, or cultural minorities. Even with our current limited government we struggle to keep legislation free of discrimination; allowing us to legislate on human reproduction would only make this task even harder, if not impossible.

Like any system of eugenics-- any regulation of reproduction is, by definition, eugenics-- Hardin’s train of thought will lead to discrimination by its nature. After all, if there a limited amount of people that can live in the world, shouldn’t we make sure that we only have the best people. If we let the government determine worthiness in this respect, than the bureaucrats running the system will let themselves and people like them reproduce before anyone else. In true Darwinian fashion, it would make sense to only let those who agree with Hardin reproduce, as its would be easier to limit human population if all parents are teaching their kids about how necessary eugenics is.

We can already see hints of racism in Hardin’s rhetoric about the welfare state, which learns dangerously close to the “welfare queen” concept: that blacks and other minorities are having more children in order to take advantage of the welfare state. Hardin talks of dealing with “the family, the religion, the race, or the class (or indeed any distinguishable and cohesive group) that adopts overbreeding as a policy to secure its own aggrandizement,” thus explicitly stating that he would seek to target groups such a Catholics, who don’t believe in birth control, or polygamists, including Fundamentalist Mormons and Muslims. 


**Tl;dr:**Hardin is proposing an impossible and racist solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.

898,ftt8xu,2020-04-02,badeconomics,Incel theory: Incel Utility Theory,"This post is in response to u/MambaMentaIity’s post on [Incel theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/fsskb4/incel_theory_is_internally_inconsistent_and_can/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). While it is an admirable attempt to prove that Incel’s outlook on women is wrong, there are some issues with his analysis. Specifically, I take issue that he asserts that w values each guy by only amount that they are willing to bid, i.e.

U^(w)=v(b^(i)) for all i, where v'(b^(i))>0 for all b^(i). (1)

I call equation (1) the gold-digger preference. w only values the amount of money guys can provide for her. But shallowness in the mind of incel's goes further than just material things. Many of Incels claim that they are not only poor, but also fat and ugly, and that is primarily why women will not date them. In other words, they only go for ""Chads"". That is, they implicitly assume that women also account for characteristics outside of amount that they are willing to bid.

To add mathematical rigor to this idea, let c^(i) be a vector characteristics of guy i. Characteristics include things like height, weight, hair color, ~~hygiene~~ ""bone structure"", etc. Then we incorporate this vector of characteristics into w's utility function:

U^(w)=v(b^(i),c^(i)) for all i. (2)

Note that for (2) to be separable, there cannot be any interactive effects between b^(i) and c^(i). I am unsure how much showering money on women distorts their value on other characters.

**Incel Axiom**

Let i be a ""Incel"" guy, i.e. someone with ""unfavorable"" characteristics, j be a ""Chad"" guy, i.e. someone with ""favorable"" characteristics, and W be the index of all women in the world.

Then v^(W)(b,c^(j))>v^(W)(b,c^(i)) for all W, i, j.

In other words, holding bids constant, all women are going to prefer the Chad over the Incel. This realization contradicts directly with outcomes yielded by a second price auction, as agents with the highest bids may not ""win"" the prize. Actually, the decision rule on the ""winner"" would be determined by:

i\* = argmax\[v^(w)(b^(i),c^(i))\] s.t. b^(i)\>0 (Since b^(i) serves as a proposal of dating) (3)

Hence, the winner is not only decided by the amount of money bid by each guy, but also their underlying characteristics. Depending on the relative magnitudes of the partial derivatives of v^(w)(b^(i),c^(i)), the bid may have little effect on result of (3).

So incels have two options to obtain w:

1. choose b^(i) s.t. v^(w)(b^(i),c^(i))>max\[v^(w)(b^(-i),c^(-i)\] (AKA, the Incel equivalent), which may be very costly to do so if even possible.
2. Or work on themselves to make them more attractive to w. This could involve having less misogynistic views towards women, taking showers more regularly, move out from their parents' basement, etc.

Notes on Assumptions:

\-I assumed that v^(w) is observable since Incels assume that they know the preferences of women and make decisions as if they do. Perhaps someone can introduce a distortion function d(v^(w)(b^(i),c^(i))) that is how Incels perceive the preferences of w.

\-I assume that the auction has a reserve price that is infinitesimally small, as submitting a bid is a proxy for wanting to date. This implicitly assumes that men only submit bids if they wish to date w. However, in reality, they could be submitting bids to sleep with her. This could add an interesting dimension in how w chooses i; How she tries to determine who is just trying to get into her pants and who truly wants to date her.",longwiener22,t2_15qlt9,0.93,212,52

We’re currently living in Colorado, however we’re both from NJ and want to be closer to our family and friends now that we have a daughter (15 months) and a baby on the way (12 weeks). We decided moving to NJ is too expensive, so Bucks county seemed like a nice compromise. We’ve always understood the area to have good schools and enjoy what the area has to offer.

So far we have been centering our housing search based on the Central Bucks school system, but houses in our price range are limited and flying off the shelves. Our realtor has begun suggesting houses in Pennridge and Palisades school districts, but we don’t know much about these districts. I did some searching in this subreddit and it honestly sounds like all of the school districts are horrible at this point - at least the way they are discriminating against students and banning books. As my children are/will be half Korean, any amount of discrimination is especially concerning to me.

Thoughts on moving to the area with 2 young children? They won’t be starting school for another 4-5 years, am I overthinking it?

EDIT: Thank you for all the responses! I’m still working on responding to everyone.

I asked some Langhorne/Levittown residents from my job and they said they love the place, and maybe they’re biased too lol and I did do some research in the area and it did not seem bad to me. Where are some good areas in Levittown? I’ve seen a lot of houses in Highland Park, what about that area? Any thoughts/opinions appreciated!",SaddestNurse,t2_55od0drv,0.91,9,58

940,198xdwk,2024-01-17,BucksCountyPA,Moving to Newtown/Yardley Area,"Hi everyone!

My girlfriend and I are considering moving to the Newtown/Yardley area sometime this summer. I currently live in NJ am an airline pilot based out of EWR and my girlfriend works in HR. I am starting at another airline soon and will be based at PHL so I would like to be closer to the airport. We are looking to rent a 2-bedroom apartment with a max budget of $3000/month for rent excluding utilities (liking Polo Run Apartments and Newtown Place so far). We spent some time driving around the area and looked at some apartment complexes and it seems like a nice spot. We prefer a quiet suburban setting compared to the congested city area and I think this area is as far south as I can go without getting too city-like (open to other suggestions)! I have a couple of questions:

1. Diversity - we are both Asian and currently live in a very diverse area in NJ. I completely understand that it won't be as diverse in Newtown/Yardley but what are your experiences like here? Just looking to be somewhere that we won't get weird looks all the time or be treated differently.

2. Traffic - does the Newtown Bypass/Township Line Road/Stony Hill Road area get congested much? Every time we drive on 295 it seems pretty quiet too so I'm not sure if commutes are too congested around here. I expect for my commute to PHL, 95 near PHL will be a bit of an issue. I am willing to deal with an hour in rush hour traffic but don’t anticipate having to travel in rush hour often.

Thank you all for your feedback! We both live at home and this will be our first time moving into a place together. We are falling in love with this area and look forward to calling it home for at least a year soon.",YPcpFkQG,t2_4sqqnklp,0.85,23,96

I work in Morrisville (previously worked in Media, Delco) and my husband and I have been seriously thinking about relocating down to Bucks County or Montgomery County.

We are a family of 3 that values diversity, are very left leaning, love great food and parks. My husband is an avid biker and fisherman, I love access to Target/Wegmans/Trader Joe's.

We are currently in Parkland SD which is *huge* and pretty comparable to CBSD for all intents and purposes, except it's one big high school. 

We've thought a lot about Montco (because we have more personal knowledge of the area) but working in Bucks now, my coworkers keep telling me to look local as well as in South Jersey.

What we know: 
-- Avoid Morrisville SD
-- we can't afford New Hope/Solebury
-- Pennridge and CBSD is imploding school board wise. 
-- we love Media and a lot of that area in Delco, but it makes absolutely no sense with me working in Morrisville
-- we LOVE SEPTA access and want it greatly

We would likely rent for a year first before trying to buy, but our purchase price would likely be in the $310k and below range. Rent wise we are paying $1800/mo for a 2br apartment in a complex. Things loosen up budget-wise considerably in a year and a half when our son is out of daycare.

(Note: that's why we started looking at some places in Burlington County NJ, we saw a few districts do Universal Pre-K.)

Places we kind of started to explore:
— North Penn (Lansdale) Montco
— Doylestown area 

Places my coworkers told me to look:
— Pennsbury
— Bristol

Places that are hard-no:

- Quakertown

My GF will be starting a job at Capital Health (Ewing Township, NJ) at the end of summer. We are a couple in our early 30's, and looking to move to Bucks County since GF's family lives in Philadelphia so want to be bit closer to them and also the lower taxes in PA. Looking to rent a 2 bedroom apartment or townhouse for now.

Priorities:

1. **Safety** \- GF will be on call every 5-6 weeks so she may have to go to the hospital in the middle of the night. I understand every city has their good parts/bad parts, but just a place where one feels safe to walk around at night if they wanted.
2. **Logistics** \- GF has priority here, an area that is easiest to get to the hospital by car in terms of traffic, bad winter conditions, etc. Generally, we prefer quieter suburbs over noisy/congested ""city"" like areas. Also, I am mainly remote but may still have to go into the office in DC every once in a while so a bonus is an area that I could drive to a train station that has fastest route to Union Station, DC.
3. **Diversity** \- We are Asian and hoping to live in a more diverse area if possible. Especially with all the stuff going on lately just overall want to be in a happy, positive, peaceful, friendly place that is open to all races.
4. **Grocery/Food** \- I am spoiled as I live in Arlington, VA. Within 10 minutes there are numerous Trader Joe's (Go here once a week), a Costco, couple hundred amazing mom and pop restaurants etc. I'm a super foodie by the way! Hoping something like that within 15 min drive if possible but the first three priorities are more essential.
5. **Nature** \- We love hiking, walking, running in nature. Hoping some nice trails around if possible. This is less of a priority compared to the first three.

Don't exactly have a budget for the rental yet. Hoping something between $1800-2400 if possible. GF has over 500k in loans so we need to tackle those so struggle is to find that balance.

Thanks everyone. I am looking forward to this next chapter in my life. I am hesitant to move as I grew up in the DC area and have an amazing job but I think it'll be a fun adventure to explore a new area. I love that it is so close to Philly and NYC.

I'm also not completely satisfied with the place I am currently living.  In the long run I don't think I would be happy commuting from where I live now to Newtown every day.  

My question:  Are there any good areas for a single 20-something male to live in Newtown, within a more reasonable commute to Newtown, or with public transportation to Newtown?  What I mean by a good area is some place with fun bars, coffee shops, and some form of nightlife in walking distance where there are many other 20-somethings living.  I expect to be working very hard at this new job, and so for the times that I am not working I want to be able to actually do something social and not just sit in my apartment alone, and do this with only the effort required of walking out my door.

So long story short, I’m 26 yrs old and never learned to drive. Driving gives me anxiety and I’m learning to drive now, but it will be a while before I have a license, and I don’t really want to own a car/doubt I will actually be comfortable driving anytime soon.

Tl;dr: I have a job prospect based out of Bucks County. It’s remote but I must be located in the county and possibly travel within it. How feasible is that without a car? Is there atleast OK public transit within the county?

Update: So now I’m thinking if I take this job, I’ll look at living in Doylestown so atleast I can walk to get groceries and do things until I’m more comfortable with driving. I would most likely only have to travel within the county once a week, and I could go through that hassle for a bit…",Acrobatic_Gas_77,t2_gbd9p3t2,0.86,15,81

According to [**reports**](https://www.phillyburbs.com/story/news/local/2024/01/29/bucks-county-seeing-more-homeless-in-need-of-shelter-code-blue-unsheltered-homeless-camps/72352769007/), she’s the fifth person to die while experiencing homelessness since this time last year.  

 Why not go inside when you live in a tent in the woods off Route 13? There are countless reasons – all tied to fear.  

 **–** Privacy. In a mass sheltering situation, there is none. Emergency cold weather shelters require that everyone sleep – together. 

**–** Leaving belongings behind. Once a person has made a home, it becomes the place where they keep their stuff. If they go into a shelter, they can be robbed.

**–** The local authorities might destroy their camp.

My wife, 10 month old, and I are moving to PA this summer for my job. I'll be working in an area called Trevose, and I know nothing about the area. I've heard that Doylestown and New Hope are nice, but that's all I know. 

We live in Southern California now (Santa Monica), but don't need the same lifestyle. We'd love to have SOME activity around, but are much more interested in family stuff, nature, good schools, and low crime. 

As a note, I'm not entirely unfamiliar with Philly - we lived in Queen Village for a few years (2010 to 2013) and loved it. We're not looking for the city lifestyle anymore, though. 

We'll rent for a year, looking to stay under ~3k/month, but less than 2.5k would be great. I work from home half the time, so if I have a bit of a commute the days I do go in, it's not a huge deal. I don't need a big home - a townhouse or small detached house is fine, and almost preferred for just a year renting because houses tend to have more issues that I don't want to deal with in a temporary situation. 

I need to head out there in a few weeks to start looking for a place, so any help would be much appreciated!!!

1071,lcuo3v,2021-02-05,BucksCountyPA,Help! Are there any physiatrist that specializes in drug addiction?,"I have a 65-year old father who got addicted to anxiety medication Lorazepam to deal with his loneliness problems over the last 20 years. Plus he’s been on OxyContin since 2006 because he had back problems that required surgery and he was too scared to go get it and stuck to taking meds with no inclination to solve his back problem. So he has been on these addictive meds since his 40’s. Mostly it’s Lorazepam, OxyContin, and Ambien. 

Years ago when Pennsylvania began cracking down on the overprescribing of OxyContin his dosage was reduced. This caused him to go crazy. And it was gotten worse now, that we need to call the cops on him more often as he has severe mental breakdowns that he’s harassing the family to get scripts for Lorazepam just to give him which is illegal.

And he stubbornly denies his addiction for years despite our pleas and thinks this can continue. He finally did after so many cop calls. My Mom has been doing that. He would walk around the house at night claiming Jesus was trying to kill him, that Mom was denying him the right to become the king of the Celts, that someone was trying to hurt him, and then more often he would scream psychotic loud shrieks continuously for hours and hours, and then stop and completely forget what he was doing wondering why we’re looking at him like this. He would bang on my mother’s bedroom door constantly never leaving her alone. Deliberately refusing to let others sleep unless he had Lorazepam or Ambien. He would take a months supply in less than a week. Even combine it with alcohol and fall down repeatedly. I had to quit my job just so I can manage him. He would constantly misplace his things like his wallet, cellphone, or glasses and immediately scream cry for hours for someone to find it. 

But he does behavior this in front of us, his family. But when he’s in front of others he acts perfectly fine, articulate, and reserved. We have had him go to psychological counseling and they clear him as fine and mentally healthy. In the sessions he just has normal conversations and places blame entirely on us his family for his anxiety with no mention at all of his behaviors and actions he does around us. As soon as he gets home and the outside world doesn’t see him, he’s back to being fragile and crying and belligerent if he doesn’t get his meds. 

Well, the mask is coming off now and the outside world is now figuring out who he is. Now he is actively seeking programs for addiction but questions if the rehab programs are Ponzi schemes.

His primary care doctor prescribed an anxiety medication that has no addiction properties, 
and to seek out at a therapist who specializes in addiction.

I still love my Dad, and want to get him on the right path now.

So this is a bit wide ranging, but what should we be aware of? Some things I wonder about are:

\- The town/county government - how difficult they are to deal with in terms of code requirements/permiting etc

\- Saw a few mentions of ""chemical smells"" in the area, and I do know there are chemical factories right next door (and a spill into the Delaware river was in the recent news). How much is this a fluke vs. daily occurrence?

\- Healthcare quality, and what's around? My wife is a nurse - will probably look for work at local hospitals.

I am recently retired (for now) at a relatively young age after 20ish grueling years working/living in NYC (currently selling my house in Staten Island). My wife and I have visited and vacationed in different parts of Bucks County (but especially New Hope/Central bucks) the past few years and we truly appreciate and love what the area has to offer. I would  appreciate if you guys could offer some insight or a point in the right direction as far as locations for me to start softly looking at. I promise we will make very good, considerate neighbors! Lol. Here are some of our considerations in looking for the new home:

1) we are looking for a newer detached home somewhere very close to “town”, meaning shopping, restaurants, and of course, schools. 

2) We are hoping to stay on grid, meaning city sewer and gas, etc. 

3) the first two points most likely mean I will end up in a small “cul-de-sac community” type-block which is perfectly fine by us.   

4) we both love nature so any nearby parks or wooded areas (I know there’s a lot lol) are a plus. 

5) as far as price, we would like to stay under the $1 million mark as the VERY high-end. I also realize we can find something at 800k or less which is great, although we are looking for something very updated and at least 3K square feet with a decent size yard. I describe all of this just to highlight the type of community we are hoping for. We are also looking at doylstown. 

Finally, I really appreciate anything you may have to say, good or bad, about bucks county-the relocation, schools, overall living, community etc… I consider myself at the “sponge stage” of looking so I will absorb and take everything into consideration!

Myself and another member attended 2 days of trial for the Commonwealth v. Kaplan case... [Not An Easy Read - but here is the story from the DAs office...you've been warned - its graphic](https://bucks.crimewatchpa.com/da/29567/post/five-more-girls-testify-about-sexual-assaults-feasterville-man)

We sat quietly in the back of the courtroom, noticed by everyone including the defendant and his attorney. Giving the nod to the children as they entered the courtroom and approached the stand. 

Deputy DA Kate Kohler is prosecuting the case and doing a great job. DA Matt Weintraub was there for the opening statements. And the defense attorney is an asshole - I understand thats generally their thing and I have no idea what his angle is with his line of cross examination questioning.

If you chose to click the link and read the story you will see the horrific details of what went on in that Lower Southampton house. Honestly, I dont even have words for it. The fact that a young child - 7 years old at the time was under the impression that she was this mans wife is beyond me. Between Kaplan and their parents, these children - these young ladies - never stood a chance. Now, mind you, this is a family that started in the Amish community, was eventually outcast and forced to leave. Which is where Kaplan stepped in and took control - first of the parents - Daniel and Savilla Stoltzfus and that trickled down to the children. 

Please keep in mind who we (BACA) are and why we exist - these are not easy articles to read and even harder to hear in person coming from the mouth of a sweet 9 year old....

1104,17qq4p1,2023-11-08,BucksCountyPA,Tell me about recreational activities in the county,"My family and I live in Seattle now, and have an opportunity (job related) to move to Bucks County.  One of the concerns we have is whether we would get bored when it comes to outdoor recreational activities.

Nothing against Bucks, it's beautiful and safe.  Still,  we are probably spoiled by the outdoor active lifestyle that is common in the PNW.  We have a sailboat on Puget Sound, about a 15 minute drive from our home, 534 acre park in walking distance where we go at least twice a week with our dogs. The Cascades are 30 miles east, so 45 min drive, and Olympics are a ferry ride west.   We get out as often as we can. Yes, the winters are gray and suck (we usually escape to Mexico or Hawaii for a month)  but summers are amazing, although we are getting more and more wildfire smoke.

So, Bucks County residents. What do you do when you get out of the house, where do you go?

Ohh, for those commenting about the climate in PA. I'm pretty familiar with it.  I was a Penn undergrad, many moons ago.

1105,18trm34,2023-12-29,BucksCountyPA,Highmark BCBS Out of State Coverage experience?,"tldr: do you live in bucks county or philly, have highmark insurance that is \*based in PA\*? Have you used this insurance plan for non-emergency, out of state care? looking for insight on your experience. *not* looking for folks with the reverse experience of insurance from a different state who have used it in PA.

\----------

I lost insurance coverage from work. COBRA is essentially a non-option due to cost.

I'm from Pennsylvania and my best current **legal proof of residence is for PA.**

**I'm living in MA** for now, and will be seeking care here, but have no legal proof of residency. I won't until I have a job lined up and get an actual lease, at which point I'll have insurance through said job.

My income doesn't qualify for subsidized insurance so I was planning on purchasing straight through commercial, not marketplace.

Highmark Blue Shield advertises PPO plans with extensive out-of-state coverage via BlueCard network.

The issue is that online ""agreement and benefits booklet"" seem to indicate that ***all*** **out-of-state (""out of area"") benefits require pre-certification including routine things** like outpatient mental health, outpatient physical therapy, chiropractic care, and maybe generic prescriptions.

For the sake of getting insurance for literally thousands less than COBRA, I don't mind the annoyance of calling for pre-certifications.

My concern is that I don't understand why routine, inexpensive things would require pre-certs? Like why are they worried about this? if not simply trying to make out of state coverage a selling point that they have the last say as to whether they actually have to follow through on it?

**Has anyone used Highmark BlueShield out of state before for non-emergency care?** Did you go through the precert process? What was it like? Did you ever have any issues? How long did each precert take? any insight at all would be helpful",dipderp3,t2_30yn7ne0,1.0,1,1

And it always helps things stick when you make them local. So use these Bucks County-based math problems to keep their brains sharp over the summer!

1. It's 2:30 a.m. Charlie is shuffling on foot at 2 mph north along the southbound lanes of Route 13, on the roadway next to the sidewalk. Alan is traveling south in his pickup truck down the southbound lanes of Route 13 at 55 mph. Alan strikes Charlie. How many Facebook comments will the LevittownNow post generate the next morning?

2. David is 34 years old, 6'4"" and 225 lbs, and lives with his mother in a trailer in Falls Township. He has been to county three times, twice for heroin-related robbery offenses and once for DV. How many children has David fathered in the last five years?

3. The average modern home air conditioner compressor contains 4.5 lbs of #2 copper. At the time of this writing, copper has a scrap value of $3.70/lb. Donnie can stay up for 32 hours straight when he has the right pills before crashing for 12. Assuming ideal conditions, how much money can Donnie bring home in an average week?

4. Tony breeds unregistered goldendoodles, has a foreign-born girlfriend who earns twice the salary he does and who is responsible for the mortgage on their Quakertown tract home, and has a career in ""IT"" that's doing Level 1 tech support in a call center. Tony claims he is a veteran, though his military career peaked when he dropped out of basic three weeks in for uncontrollable nocturnal emissions. How many times did Tony taze himself in the gnards on his way to DC in Worthington's bus?

\- All mail-in ballots were sent to Philly at once to be mailed out.  Thousands upon thousands upon thousands of ballots.  So it will take a few days to make sure each one is sent

1129,18pi8by,2023-12-24,BucksCountyPA,Holiday spirit needed,"The below info was copied and pasted from the Nextdoor app and I want to share because we can help make things somewhat bearable for a local family. 


Hi Neighbors,

I wanted to give an update on the family that I had written about that needs our help for their last Christmas together. I had posted  a week ago  about it and changed up the game plan which took me a bit but now on track. The Telford PD have graciously stepped in to help as well. The Chief is personally going to their house to see what can be done and what is needed. 

The family who I am referring to is a family who is facing hardship of the highest magnitude. 

I work for a local hospice and we have a patient who just came on service. A 47 year old man with an end stage disease who found out about it not too long ago. 

He has a wife and four children ranging from 12-21yrs old. The family is reeling and it is a heart breaking situation. We are trying to raise funds ( there is a go fund page and I will post the link) to help the family now and when the patient passes.  The patient is the sole financial provider and had to call his work today to tell them he will not be returning. So, not only is the family facing the most devastating of losses but also has the heavy weight of what will happen in the future.  I’d love for us to get together as a community and help this family. 

I have had people step up from next door already and it is just amazing to see and witness the love that comes from within to help others in a time of need. 

I will post more of the story shortly and I have permission to do so. 

Let’s try to make their last Christmas one to remember forever.

However, students shouldn’t be left in a position where they are in debt, paying for services they are not using, or presented with a sub-par education. At the moment, many are essentially left to fend for themselves.

As unfortunate as these circumstances are, it is neither unsurprising that universities have put students in such a precarious position nor that they are unprepared to respond to the crisis. Historically, the university is an institution that dominantly serves the interests of the state and the wealthy. This is shown by the long tradition of weapons technology development for the United States military at universities. In addition, defense contractors like Raytheon [are invited onto campuses by universities like Boston University so they can recruit university students to work for them after graduation](https://masspeaceaction.org/event/protest-war-profiteer-raytheon-at-boston-university-feb-5-2020/). These corporations make their fortunes by designing weapons that kill innocent people all over the world as part of the U.S. imperialist war machine.

Furthermore, there is extreme inequality in academia and education. For example, [one study found that there are more American students from the top 1% enrolled in universities than the bottom 60%](https://www.dailycal.org/2019/03/19/a-systemic-failure-its-time-to-stop-perpetuating-elitism-in-higher-education/). Some of the more elite private schools use “legacy” in their admission process, meaning that [if a student had parents or grandparents that attended the university then their chances of getting in are higher](https://www.dailycal.org/2019/03/19/a-systemic-failure-its-time-to-stop-perpetuating-elitism-in-higher-education/). A recent scandal known as [“Operation Varsity Blues”](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/college-admissions-scandal-list-operation-varsity-blues-every-charge-plea-accusation-facing-parents-2019-05-16/) exposed how dozens of wealthy parents, test administrators, and college coaches rigged the college admission process for students whose parents were willing and able to pay bribes and engage in standardized test cheating. These are just a few examples that show how the university is designed to serve the interests of the state and the ruling class.

This has been made more evident as universities have transitioned to a model based more on ruthless corporate-type profit models. [In the last ten years the average cost of tuition has increased 25%](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/13/cost-of-college-increased-by-more-than-25percent-in-the-last-10-years.html), [student loan debt has risen to a total of $1.64 trillion](https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/)[1](https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/coronavirus/as-virus-spreads-colleges-punt-students-and-keep-their-cash/#fn:1), and [university presidents are in some cases earning over $1 million a year salaries](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-dozen-public-college-presidents-are-paid-over-1-million-but-do-we-taxpayers-the-benefit-2019-01-04). Universities now more clearly appear as profit seeking institutions for the rich rather than institutions that provide opportunities to working class people. With this in mind, it isn’t hard to understand why the university has done such a poor job protecting the interests of its students, particularly low-income students, who have a harder time responding to the crisis. The university may claim that telling students to leave campus is all about controlling the spread of Coronavirus. But, at the end of the day, the university is like any other business and is primarily concerned about revenue.

Having students stay on campus during the crisis would be a major liability concern and would put the university at risk of having to spend millions to provide emergency food, housing, and other services to students. It would require universities to actually think creatively about fulfilling these needs, but these institutions would rather focus on their so-called bottom line. In response to being kicked off campuses and having classes moved to an online format, students have demanded refunds on tuition and other services they previously paid for.

In the wake of the outbreak, universities are balking at student demands for tuition refunds. For example, Kutztown University in Pennsylvania has stated that it will not even provide partial refunds for tuition, [but will offer refunds for 50% of fees for dining, housing, and other auxiliary services for the spring semester](https://www.lvb.com/local-colleges-universities-issue-partial-refunds-amid-covid-19-closure/). In Wisconsin a similar strategy is being used by the University of Wisconsin System where the [state’s 13 universities will refund just under $80 million for unused housing and dining services, but nothing for tuition costs](https://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-colleges-refund-tens-millions-dollars-students-due-covid-19). In California, [the nine-campus UC system stated they will continue to charge the same amount of tuition and campus-based fees with no discounts, regardless of if a student is paying out-of-state tuition](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/18/give-us-a-tuition-break-say-california-students-forced-into-online-university-classes/). One egregious example of university contempt for students’ plight is from New York University. In response to students’ demands for refunds on tuition payments, Allyson Green, Dean of NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, recorded a video clearly stating the university would not provide refunds. As a conciliatory gesture however, she [thought it wise to record a bizarre video of herself dancing in her apartment](https://nyulocal.com/an-open-letter-to-tisch-dean-allyson-green-please-stop-72785d5a86c1). Rather than lighten tensions, NYU students saw this as a slap in the face to their legitimate demands. The video also revealed the gap in wealth and circumstances between themselves and the university administration.

&#x200B;

[Students at MIT protested against the university’s decision to evict them from the campus and highlighted how MIT serves the rich and powerful.](https://preview.redd.it/633eta8tier41.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5b2dedc6eea3a2f7dc4898c44ffe04bcec86fa8)

These are just a few examples of universities that have switched to an online model, but that nonetheless decided not to refund or lower tuition costs. Most universities are claiming that providing tuition refunds would be a step too far and would drain their cash reserves. Therefore, they claim partial refunds on housing, unused meal plans, and service fees are the best they can do. This is ridiculous considering the vast amounts of cash reserves that many universities enjoy. Many universities have [large endowments](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/how-do-university-endowments-work/), donated money which they invest for profit [in much the same way as a hedge fund](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/universities-are-becoming-billion-dollar-hedge-funds-with-schools-attached/).

At universities in the University of California system for example, [the various endowments total about $16 billion, roughly $67,000 per student](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/08/25/how-the-university-of-california-and-other-public-schools-use-reserve-funds-to-keep-pace/). At more elite institutions like Princeton, [the endowment total per student is about $2.8 million](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/08/25/how-the-university-of-california-and-other-public-schools-use-reserve-funds-to-keep-pace/). While the spending of endowment money is often restricted to specific projects, in times of crisis this money should be utilized to serve the interests of students. Despite universities’ claims that they are doing all they can for students, it is clear that in times of crisis universities are unwilling to use cash reserves to protect their students.

Students have protested the way that universities have handled the housing situation in the wake of the virus outbreak. For example, at Boston University students were forced to vacate on-campus residence halls after the university had earlier informed students that vacating dorms was suggested but optional. [Many students now forced to leave do not have a place to go and have had to find a place to live at the last minute](https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/03/18/boston-university-tells-students-to-leave-campus-housing-by-sunday-creating-new-chaos-amid-coronavirus/). Some international students are unable to go back home due to travel restrictions. Others simply cannot afford the cost of moving and paying for a new place to live. In addition, sending people home has probably contributed to the further spread of the virus. The confusion and anger caused by the university’s unclear response to the situation prompted students to protest. As part of their demands, they [called on the university to use money from BU’s $2 billion endowment](https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/03/18/boston-university-tells-students-to-leave-campus-housing-by-sunday-creating-new-chaos-amid-coronavirus/) to aid them. If the university insists on forcing students to leave, this money could be used to provide food, secure housing, or pay moving costs for students in this time of crisis. But given the prioritization of other interests over the safety and security of students, it is highly unlikely students there or elsewhere will receive such aid.

The BU student protest against the sudden forced eviction is just one of several related examples of student activism in recent weeks. Students are increasingly aware they are being ripped off by the university system, and they are growing tired of it. The increasing cost of college leaves many students in intense debt or simply unable to attend. On average, [college students are paying $48,510 for private universities and $21,370 for public universities per year](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/13/cost-of-college-increased-by-more-than-25percent-in-the-last-10-years.html). Four years of such costs is a tremendous burden for working and middle-class families. In order to pay these high costs, students and their families have to take out loans.

[Among the class of 2019, 69% of college students took out student loans and graduated with an average debt of $29,900](https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/). Taking out these loans forces students to borrow money from their future. It will take years at best for most to get out of such debt. This is an extremely unstable situation that puts students and their families in a dangerous position where debt payments will follow them for decades. Despite having a college degree, [students in debt are 36% less likely to buy a house, less likely to take out car loans](https://scholarshipamerica.org/blog/the-far-reaching-impact-of-the-student-debt-crisis/), and [more likely to have poor credit scores](https://scholarshipamerica.org/blog/the-far-reaching-impact-of-the-student-debt-crisis/). More college students are thinking twice about even attending college at all as a result. This puts people in a bind given that even low paying jobs often require a college diploma. The fact that some students would rather not go to college at all than spend tens of thousands of dollars on tuition or take out tens of thousands of dollars in loans is a strong indication that the university is not designed to serve the interests of working-class people.

The Coronavirus pandemic has further exposed the university for what it is, an institution that serves the interests of the state and the ruling class. Poor working-class people are unable to afford the exorbitant cost of tuition and risk going into intense debt as a result of attending university. Low-income students who have managed to attend college are in a much more precarious position than wealthy students as they respond to the outbreak. The present treatment by university administrations has pushed many students to the brink of homelessness and hunger. In protests, students have been struggling to demand that universities respect their needs in a time of crisis, but most institutions have only budged a bit, in general offering at most partial refunds for housing and other services. This is unacceptable as [8 out of 10 students work while in college](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/24/working-in-college-can-hurt-low-income-students-more-than-help.html) to help pay their massive tuition, housing, food, and other school material costs. And now most of these students are out of a job, putting them in an even more financially dangerous position. Students should not be in this position. As the Coronavirus crisis continues to worsen, universities need to be forced not to simply abandon students.

1. The explosion of student loan debt is a key part of the overall economic crisis that was brewing before Coronavirus hit.
