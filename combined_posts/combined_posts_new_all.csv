2,177hc7o,2023-10-14,MensRights,White men are actively discriminated against in the job market right now,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm a 32 year old white male in the tech industry. Specifically PM work. I was let go in the mass layoffs months ago by a major tech company that all of you probably know of. I have been in multiple interview rounds with good companies and I have never seen the market this bad for white men ever in my adult career.

Just to preface without sounding like gloating, I have a good resume with solid experience from desirable companies. I've had a number of interviews, and for the positions I want, most hiring managers/majority of panel interviewers have been women, either white or minorities. And oddly enough, every single time I reach the final stages of the interview process and I find myself interviewing with one of these women in a position of power, I get a swift rejection email.

I am cordial, well spoken and friendly. I received two offers from interviews, with the hiring managers/majority of panel members being men but unfortunately they are not companies I am very interested in.

**Two alarming trends I have noticed in tech are that being a white man is an instant negative for most companies**, especially if you find yourself in front of a panel of women or a hiring manager who is a woman. Women are also being promoted to these HM positions in much less time than their male counterparts.

**The other is underqualified women are getting these jobs that white men are competing for at increasing rates.** I checked back for the roles I was rejected for that have been filled and, unsurprisingly, all but one of them were filled by women with less experience than I have.

Just wanted to let other men (white men specifically) that are struggling know that you aren't alone. You don't meet the quotas that these companies have and you are playing against a stacked deck. This is the worst I have ever seen it, and I can only assume it will get worse. I have spoken with close friends and they are experiencing the same thing.

White men are being discriminated against in the job market and nobody wants to talk about it.",EntranceSafe96,t2_lq98byj35,0.91,821,201

7,6uumes,2017-08-20,MensRights,Fuck office politics: newly arrived female coworker is in difficulty with her work and is attacking my reputation behind my back. WTF???,"The reason I post here is because many of the things this coworker does she can get away with it because she's a woman, and she's blatantly using female shaming tactics (people may not agree with the fact these are female tactics, but I think they are), *in the workplace*, to get her way...

She had a task: do her job and learn ho to do new things. Me (and others) supported her. After a few months I no longer had the obligation to support her and I realized she was slacking on purpose (facebook, amazon, chats, etc, instead of working). She... didn't like that. Because she had decided *not* to learn anything, when push came to shove and she needed to deliver, she went mad and started using the only coin at her disposal to fight the situation: social group, gossip, men-hating.

She started attacking me behind my back, trying to ruin my reputation. Her reasoning was that our boss was pressuring her to deliver, she didn't know how to do the job (spent months without applying herself) and because I was capable of doing it, *I had to drop everything for her*.

To quote her (a coworker showed me this):

- ""why doesn't Demian do it instead of me? He's the only one who knows how to do it anyway..."".
- ""I'm stuck with this, the *client* is an asshole, it's not clear what I have to do... of course it would be a lot easier if Demian supported me, but he never helps me...""
- ""this job is shit, can't do it... talk to me about your weekend :)""
- ""I asked X to give me a hand, I'm waiting for him. I watched this cool movie last night...""

Again and again, complaints in private to her friend (one of the PMs) in order to get someone to tell me to do the job *for her*. Never mentioning how she was told, when hired, that *she needed to learn this stuff*! Only implying how she's willing to do the job but my lack of support is blocking her (false and shameless accusation)...

She decided by herself that team work meant she was excempted from every responsibility. This is an example of a chat conversation:

- SHE: demian, you are not busy, right? :)
- ME: I'm busy, sorry.
- SHE: eh... you are doing research... can't you help me with this?
- ME: sorry, but I can't help you. Try to take it slowly and face one problem at a time, you'll get there.
- SHE: but I need someone to show me how it's done...
- ME: and I sent you lots of material months ago, I can't do the job for you..

She grabbed the last message and send it to four different women and a guy so they could support her in bashing me.

I had to protect myself after that. I intervened with certain coworkers and made sure my version was known. After a few days, she made so much noise and her work was so behind that my boss asked me my opinion on her and her work. 

Because of what she did (the chat convo was just one occurrence of her gossip), I sunk her in front of my boss. I spent almost 8 months without saying anything negative about a coworker (her!) in order to avoid putting her in a difficult spot, and what does she does?

She targets me because I don't go over mountains for her (where does the entitlement come from lol????) and decides to fuck with my reputation, just because she was lazy and had to choose between admitting her lack of knowledge to my bosses (damage to her image) or use social games to blame *me* instead (damage to *my* image)...

-------

Right now, I was promoted and next month I'll be in charge of her work. At the moment, she latched onto another coworker, constantly ""asking"" him how to do things, constantly ""asking"" him to look up stuff for her by saying ""she doesn't know how to do the job..."", and implying he has to because of ""team work""...

While the guy looks for stuff up, she opens her chat or facebook and starts doing random stuff or talking with her friends, waiting for him. And the spineless guy refuses to say ""no"" to her, is depressed and overloaded of work all day, and earns even less than she does...

And by the way, whenever the guy can't cope with it anymore and snaps at her, she starts gossiping behind his back telling everyone how this guy is having his ""ladies days""...

The three of us were on the same role inside the company, but unlike us, who focused on the job, she focused on her relationship with the others. At first I thought this wouldn't be an issue because we are all different, until she started using that ""support group"" she formed to backup her up on her lack of skills and all her BS...

Fucking office politics. And fuck women who blatantly push to establish social bonds with other women and then use gossip to get their way against men who actually work and don't give a crap about this stuff...",demian78,t2_ax22xax,0.89,934,219

Feminists will die on the hill of men have all the power and opress women. 
But what they fail to even acknowledge is that they're talking about the top 5-10% of man.

Most men are complacent, sexless and one unemployed month away from bankruptcy. But these men are invisible to the modern woman.

What about the working man? Does that man wake up at 6am in the morning to go pick up garbage, to fix the broken roads or to repair a few trucks think ""oh well i will go to work today for minimum wage so i can continue oppressing these women yay male power""
No. He thinks ""I will go to work so my family can have warm meals today""

Every time I have this sort of discussion with someone I take a look around me and usually end up poiting at a working class man and this often shuts up the other person for good.
Because deep down they understand the struggles the average man faces yet everyone is lost in feminist liberal propaganda so the line is very blurred.

--------------

There is evidence of a growing number of men, who avoid women in the workplace, avoid being one on one, avoid mentoring women. This hurts women. 

https://nypost.com/2019/05/17/men-are-afraid-to-mentor-women-after-metoo-and-it-hurts-us-all-study/

I read a number of articles on that topic. Another example:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/pragyaagarwaleurope/2019/02/18/in-the-era-of-metoo-are-men-scared-of-mentoring-women/

There is a common pattern. Authors ignore and dismiss concerns of men, they give their own explanations of the experiences, feelings and motives of these men, in condescending and scolding manner and shift the topic to empowering women, defeating bias against women and improving career opportunities for women. So basically men should shut up, stop whining and do their best to help women advance. I'd say, it is basically womansplaining.

I know, that feminism is about women's issues, not about troubles of men. That's fair enough, I totally accept this approach. So let's assume these papers are supposed to fix the problem for women, defeat the backlash against metoo. However, let's see what kind of message does it deliver to these men, who are afraid of women at the workplace? 

Men aren't listened to. Their concerns and point of view are ignored. Men aren't entitled to be treated with dignity and feeling of security. Men are an instrument for the advance of  women... 

So if a man is afraid of women, he receives a message that his fears are completely valid.

Edit:

So. How would you approach that problem (men silently ignoring women, because they are afraid)?",WanabeInflatable,t2_16k72e,0.97,1714,370

\- no touching besides introductory handshakes

\- I NEVER comment on their looks, this applies for both positive and negative comments. I don't even do it when they are not around.

\- I never talk about dating or sex with/around them.

There, its that simple. I followed these rules since I started working and had 0 problems or complaints so far.

In my eyes the not following these rules is a risk not worth taking, especially for unattractive guys like myself.

I've heard my female coworkers calling guys creeps for merely attempting what I would judge to be ""corporate friendly"" and politically correct flirting. It only takes one willing to escalate things beyond gossip to ruin your livelihood.

28,ppkfjn,2021-09-16,MensRights,I was sexually harassed by a woman at work. I reported her to her male superior and I was crucified.,"I was hired to work in a profession where more men are needed, simply because many women do not want to do some of the work involved.

My immediate boss was a pushy woman who did not understand the concept of boundaries. For example, she made telephone calls at all hours. I immediately make friends and one of the people I got very friendly with was a woman - we totally had no romantic interest in each other - and she acted more like a drinking buddy.

For some reason my boss did not like to see this friendship. For example every day, I had lunch with my female friend. But my boss warned both me and her that we were spending too much time together and I needed to spend time with people who were more knowledgeable in the work we were doing.

My boss started to call me over to her office on the pretense of explaining something or asking about progress on some project I was working on but she started flirting a lot and this involved her putting her hand on my thigh, near my crotch. Her language was also vulgar and amongst other things she made 'jokes' like asking me what size shoes I wore because according to her penis size is related to shoe size.

I sent her an email, copied in to our male, gay manager, outlining her behaviour and why I thought it was inappropriate.

I was horrified when I was fired but doubly so when she reported me to the police for lying about her and tarnishing her reputation! Incredibly the police are taking action against me.

Edit: Please understand that I cannot give more detailed information such as location etc. Others are asking me questions like what can the police do... etc. But I would rather not reply publicly as it might compromise my position and my future course of action. I thank you all for your support.

29,odi2ma,2021-07-04,MensRights,"""Emotional labour"" is the term women use when they emotionally abuse men.","After reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/lums86/woman_realizes_shes_been_accidentally_abusing_her/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), I started thinking about the all too common story of the husband who has no self-confidence left. Reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ocxwrc/why_are_so_many_women_unaware_of_the_emotional/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), however, really set me off to writing this post.

""[Emotional labor](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/emotional-labor-in-the-workplace/202004/emotional-labor-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not) is the regulation of one’s feelings at one’s job."" Although, as acknowledged by the article linked, the meaning has been stretched to mean, ""[Women planning things.](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/)""

Both cases of ""emotional labour"" (and all other cases that include its stretched definition) have one thing in common: an abusive woman.

Picture this: You're a husband who works a job, and are trying to help around the house. Good for you, right? Except, before anything else, you'll be [berated](https://www.katykatikate.com/the-blog/2019/5/7/so-you-want-to-help-around-the-house) for not being a perfect mind-reading magician and doing so earlier. 

Then comes the fun part: Nothing you do will satisfy her. You'll be scolded and called ""incompetent"" for getting the tiniest of details wrong. You're not good enough, and you never will be. Not unless you read her mind perfectly, because she can't bother explaining things to you; she shouldn't have to.

Any confidence you had in yourself is gone, and you stop doing those things you wanted to; you always get them wrong, anyways. This is the real kicker: Now you'll be blamed for not doing enough. You're now a lazy bum, a manchild, a mama's boy. You depend on her for everything, and she can't take it, so she takes it out on you. ""I don't have to ask you to help! You should know already!"". That's the part that gets you. ""You should know already."" You should already know what she needs help doing. You should already be doing the thing. You should already know exactly how to do the thing, to the last detail. You should already know all that, and the only reason you don't is because you're not good enough.

But oh no, you're not the victim in all this; she is, because she's doing the ""emotional labour"". Stop thinking your feelings are valid; they're just a manifestation of your ""fragile male ego"" that ""needs constant appeasing"". She doesn't need to caress your ego. You need to be the man she needs you to be, because you're not good enough.",Hey_itsmeguys,t2_a3edilh8,0.86,1732,314

in full disclosure, i'm a white male, in a creative industry that is being regulated and run by media companies with a heavy woke agenda. i've been working my way up the ladder for 15 + years now and i'm constantly seeing job offer listings with the heading ""(BIPOC) preferred."" make no mistake about it, media companies have an agenda to hire diversity. AKA, anybody but WHITE MALES.

women and people of color are being hired with no experience and being promoted up the chain overnight, something i've been working years to achieve. Further, the older white male bosses, know they're in the cross hairs and can be cancelled any minute and are terrified they are going to lose their rarified high paying job, and are as one boss told me ""making me hire"" diverse candidates, over ability, loyalty and experience.

It's not only the corporate media initiatives on the hiring side, but it's also the content - the content is all about women issues, with trans subject matter. So if you have netflix, hulu, disney, etc. you must notice that all your content is starring women and about women's issues and LBGQT subjects, etc.

Nevermind that Top Gun - an arguably patriotic, male, testosterone, action movie has done billions of dollars in GLOBAL revenue for these same companies.

You'll notice the jobs i'm speaking of are not -- plumbers, construction, electrical, truck driving, HVAC -- fields that women have no interest in, that require specialized skill and intensive labor. These are creative jobs where the only SKILL you have to have is be able to feel and relate as a woman or diverse person of color. Experience, skill be damned. The question USED TO BE ""what experience do you have?"" now the question is ""what gender and ethnicity are you?""

Further, my bosses on my last shows were ALL WOMEN (making million dollar salaries). so the notion that women are being subjugated and oppressed and dont have any mobility or opportunities, is patently false.

if i'm my own critic? hey it's social darwinism.  the times are changing, bud!  and get used to it, pal! The patriarchy is over!

but it's a tough pill to swallow. And I am angry and fed up. i'm just a guy who works his ass off and is being pushed to the back of the line because of my gender and skin color.

I'm not sure what to do. I feel like i have to leave my dream and go elsewhere. Become a grey man and disappear. But it's happening. and I'm not sure how to adapt. But I'm in boiling water now and i dont expect it to change.

33,11asgcb,2023-02-24,MensRights,Women need to be called out on their hypocritical use of sexuality in the workplace,"Why does nobody has the balls to call this out?!

Women use their sexuality in work and work related settings ALL THE TIME. When they want a favor from a coworker, when they need help, when they are looking for a raise or promotion, when they are trying to get a new client/customer.

I had several dates with highly successful beautiful business women and they all laughingly admit of flirting and leading coworkers or clients/customers on in order to get that sale, promotion or just get it ""their way"". Had a date where the female CEO said if the client is a man, she sends one of her hot employees, always. And i myself -of course- over the years first hand have seen women get all girly and sexy, start using their cute girly voice when they need a favor or whatever. Its so blatant and normal, everyone knows it.

Yet women flip the fuck out when a man tries to be flirty or tries to use sexuality in their favor. They act like its an  unthinkable immoral crime that needs to be punished. If you ask women if sexuality belongs in the workplace, they all say ABSOLUTELY NOT. Yet they use it every single fucking day. Hell women told me they dress sexier for clients when they want to get a deal/sale. They flirt, they drop sexual suggestions only to later shoot the man they led on down. This all would be fine...if they weren't hypocrites that literally try to cancle and destroy men who dare to flirt back or god forbid initiate a flirt.

Coworker or customer flirts with woman at work = Oh god look at that creepy piece of shit. He should be reported and fired, this doesn't belong in the workplace.

37,b04wtm,2019-03-12,MensRights,Lost my job because I was targeted for being a white male,"I'm a 33 year old white male, and I am a mental health counsellor. I worked on a team with 4 other females, all counsellors/social workers/etc. On that team was a 23 year old who made her opinions about men very clear. Back in August she presented my manager with a list of things that I had said that offended her. I had no idea I was saying anything that offended her. There was about 6 things on this list, and many of them were just me expressing a different opinion than her. It was certainly never my intention to offend anyone with these opinions, and they weren't racist or sexist or derogatory. I've shown this list to many people, including many women, some of whom said they disagreed with some of my opinions, but none said they were worth complaining about. What's worse is this individual took the things I said, and twisted them, either misquoting them or taking them completely out of context, to make me look a certain way. I don't think she did this intentionally, I do believe this is what she heard me say as my words went through her filter. 

She took it to the manager, who is a female and has also demonstrated having a negative bias towards men. For this reason, I was not offered the chance to tell my side of the story; I was ignored when pointing out that I didn't say these things the way she is saying I did. I was offended, and pointed out to my manager that other people on the team, including the woman who presented this list and my manager herself, have made comments that I could have complained about should I have wanted to. My manager has also commented on my appearance more than once, which is sexual harassment, and I reminded her of this (although I didn't put it that way). I stated that I felt this was incredibly hypocritical, but it didn't matter; I was sent to anti-racism anti-oppression training, one-on-one with a trainer chosen by my manager. I showed him the list, told him my side, and he said, in his professional opinion of doing this for 20+ years, that he felt I'm being singled out and I'm being sent to this training to be ""fixed"" so I'll go back to work, shut my mouth and be quiet. He believed this was a team issue being turned into a me issue, and I agreed. This was in September. In November we met with this trainer as a team. It was uncomfortable. I expressed my fear of sharing an opinion that someone disagrees with lest it be held against me at a later time. But we did the training, and things went back to normal. My working relationship with this young woman was never the same, but it was civil. 

Flash forward 3 months, when I am sitting in my office waiting for my first client of the day, and my manager and an hr rep entered my office and told me I am being let go because I ""don't fit in"" and that my ""views are better suited elsewhere."" It was out of nowhere. I had been so careful with everything I had said since August. I received no warning, no investigation, no opportunity to fight for my job. It was decided.

I have dedicated my life to helping others. I do not discriminate against anyone, quite the opposite in fact. I help individuals of all genders, sexual orientations, races, religions, ethnicities, ages and so on. I help many people who have been discriminated against, oppressed, or stigmatized. But I was on a team with a 23 year old female who only ever saw me as a white male, and she targeted me, and she was successful. She has had an impact on me financially, on my career, and a severe impact on my mental health. I hate her, and I hate my biased manager who handled the situation different than she would have if the roles were reversed. This is a scary time.

Edit: I should have mentioned I consulted an employment lawyer. He is a friend of a friend, so I trust him and his advice. He said that although I likely have a case of discrimination, he strongly suggested I don't take legal action on the basis of discrimination, due to the fact that I am straight, white and male. He said that win or lose the case, it would reflect bad on me, particularly in the field that I work in.

The list:
-age (she was the youngest on the team by 10 years. Myself, and the rest of the team, would occasionally playfully tease her about her age. I never once put her down because of it. At a team meeting she asked all of us to stop it, and I know I did. And yet, it still made the list) -he said that questions about power and privilege on interviews are useless (in fact, I said ""I didn't see the point"" but I was referring to one specific case, but that's a whole other story. But she generalized it, and that was not my intention or meaning nor my words) - mat leave (the women on the team were having a conversation about how the US was cutting parental leave time and were talking about how sexist it is. I said I don't think it's fair to call it sexist because, although it disproportionately affects women, it affects all genders who would take parental leave) -said he wanted another male on the team; ""there are too many of you and only one of me"" (at a team meeting we were talking about hiring a new person for the team, I suggested we consider hiring another male as some clients request male counsellors specifically and because I felt it might add some more diversity to the team. I was often shut down very quickly if the women on the team did not agree with my opinion.

######Credit: u/FelineQuinine

Notice how 93% of workplace fatalities are still men.  A fact that men apparently do not get compensated for.

~~The math is pretty simple, though not obvious at first:~~

~~$1 / ($1 + $0.77) = 0.56~~

I think this shows pretty clearly what the largest factor in the earnings gap is.

Of course the fact that men have to work longer hours than women is itself a problem. Paying for dates and bills for your girlfriend / wife isn't exactly cheap. Not to mention that many women look for men who earn more money, thus creating an incentive for men to sacrifice their work-life balance in order to earn more.

I guarantee most men would love to work fewer hours and spend more time at home but the spending and earning patterns of their partners don't often facilitate this.

This also contributes to poorer health outcomes for men and the fact that men die 5 years earlier than women on average.

**Edit:** Graph is fine, title is misleading.  The 77 cents per dollar thing is likely just a colloquialism at this point.

I’m not joining the club. 

I can’t take you seriously if the word entitlement isn’t paired with responsibility. Start explaining what you are responsible for. 

I don’t care if you wear a bra. Why is this still a thing ? Do what you want. 

I don’t need to hear anything related to your reproductive cycle, we are not a couple so why do you feel like sharing publicly. Sharing is not caring. Your body is your business. 

If you take the time to creat list and be thoughtful do it silently. Telling others about the emotional labor you endured takes away from any generosity you supposedly offered. 

If women are still too sexualized it’s because too many of your sisters are looking for  a short cut. Deal with them, not me. 

If a man shares a thoughts or a feeling let him finish it. Talking isn’t a competitive sport. Emotions are real and not icons in your chat app. Let a man express himself  once in a while. And listen once in a while. 

And lastly, if men are so bad why do you glom onto them as if they are owed to you. No man owes you anything, least of all a relationship if he isn’t ready for one. Or if you are not the one.

134,n0jarm,2021-04-28,MensRights,All female management and HR forced me out of the company after reporting harassment,"This happened three years ago at a small company and it still has been weighing on me. It was one of those ""we're one big family"" tech companies who prided itself on having beer in the fridge and a ""great culture"". 

The management structure above me was my lead (female), mid level manager (female), direct manager (female), and department head (male). The HR department was 3 people (all female). For what it's worth, I am also an ethnic minority and all the women in management were white women. 

Myself, a female colleague, and another male colleague were all up for a promotion. The only one that walked away with a promotion was my female colleague, despite myself and my male colleague being there far longer (I actually interviewed and made the call to hire the person who was promoted). The company had a formal list of criteria needed for a promotion, so I created a list with evidence for every bullet point and sent it to my manager. She refused to even glance at it and told me my accomplishments were not relevant. Weeks later I pleaded with her to go over this document and discuss my career goals. She flipped out on me, called me all kinds of names, and then stormed off. 

I went to the head of the department and explained what had happened. He was shocked at the behavior and had no idea what was going on in the department. He scheduled a meeting with the three of us and she tried to lay into me again, but instead her boss chewed her out for unprofessional behavior. He then saw my list of accomplishments and decided I was definitely in line for a promotion and I was promoted not long after, along with my male colleague. I thought it was over. Boy was I wrong.

A few months later the department head left the company and was replaced by a female department head (so the entire management structure was female). My boss held a grudge and it was open season on me now. But this time she stepped over the line and harassed me over email with direct language about a disability I have. This is blatantly illegal so I went to HR. 

They immediately defended her and tried to gaslight me. Everything I said they tried to counter, until I presented them with the harassment in writing. I stood firm and knew my rights and they backed down. What transpired after that was 6 months of retaliation (I spoke to a lawyer and he said there's not much you can do until they fire you). 

Constant belittling, talking bad about me to other coworkers, turning people against me. Every 1 on 1 meeting we had was recorded (something she never did to anyone else). Every time I pushed this up the all female chain of command it fell on deaf ears. Eventually I left the company, just like they wanted. My position was filled by my boss's female friend. I am told by someone that still works there she had been badmouthing me behind my back for over 2 years.

Keep in mind this is a company where other female employees openly said they discriminated against men. They host and sponsor feminist events. They openly say their pride themselves on hiring women. 

When I reported my manager for harassment, it was me against a clique that openly made it clear where they stand, and that stance was firmly against men.

I know my experience is nothing compared to the literal horror stories that have been posted here but I just felt I needed to get this whole thing off my chest.

So I started thinking about opening an anti-feminism online store some time ago. I hate all these feminist slogan T-shirts that are everywhere nowadays. I wasn't familiar with the screen printing process but I figured I'd use the service of companies which handle that for you. And so I went for it. Boy, I was in for a treat.

After I'd created the shirt designs, I started looking for a screen printing company. I didn't expect there to be so many options to choose from, so I spent some time researching. There were two or three companies that kind of dominated the industry but they charged more than the rest just because they had more bells and whistles. 

This put me off as I couldn't afford to pay for unnecessary stuff. My first choice was a smaller company that I hoped would offer more of a personalized service. So I created my account, uploaded my designs and continued the work on my online store. However, the next day I was notified my designs were apparently in violation of this site's rules and qualified as offensive. I re-read their policy and while I did not agree that my designs [(here's a few examples)](http://imgur.com/a/mRjzb#1) were in any way abusive or offensive, I decided to let it go and use another service. I figured any arguments at that point would be meaningless.

Now here's where the real fun starts. After going through the entire process again - filling out forms, uploading designs etc. - I received a termination email of sorts from the second company too! This time it wasn't even some pre-written template. It was sent to me directly by the owner of the service, basically telling me to go to hell because of my 'ridiculous' views.

[Screenshot.](http://imgur.com/a/mRjzb#0)

A proud 'fefminist'? She must've been so mad that she started mistyping words and stuff, lmao. Acting all outraged by the fact that people are selling men's rights apparel. Because that's reserved for poor oppressed feminists only, right? But who's the oppressed one really? Again, my designs were in no way abusive!

Her condescending tone admittedly pissed me off, though the fact that she came off as an illiterate moron kind of amused me at the same time. It was frustrating mostly because I had to start all over several times but I tried not to get worked up about it and now I'm close to finishing my project with another company.

Everything I thought about feminism was true. It isn't about gender equality at all.

For the record, I have not mentioned any company names because I realize how passionate this community is. I don't want to feel guilty in case any companies/websites receive some sort of backlash due to my comments. Sure, I think they might deserve it to a certain extent but I also don't wish to affect their source of income even if their handling of the situation was questionable.

EDIT: To the guys who think I should post the companies' names: I appreciate your opinion, but it's not happening for the following reasons:

1) I DID submit personal details to both services. Some people have already called me a coward but I've had personal dealings with raving feminists before and I do not wish to go through all the bullshit again. Especially online. I don't have the time and I don't need the drama. If you feel I'm letting you down, sorry.

2) Whatever I've shared here, they will simply deny, so what's the point? It's their word against mine, except that it's also their company.

3) The companies are small enough that I can almost guarantee you won't be unfortunate enough to stumble upon their services unless you were very, very specific. If you're looking to get an online tee business going, don't make the mistakes I made and just go to a major company.

As far as the shirts go: as I mentioned in the original post, I'd considered working with one of the big screen printing companies to finish my store but after reading through the comments and doing some additional research, I'm going with an on demand fulfillment service. It's more convenient and I hope it won't take too long because I'm going on vacation soon.

It gets even worse.

Women complains that man keeping it professional at work makes her and other female coworkers feel uncomfortable","The other day I was bored and started doomscrolling on Reddit when I found this post on r/relationship_advice 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/10yx39j/a\_colleague\_at\_work\_27m\_of\_1\_year\_refuses\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10yx39j/a_colleague_at_work_27m_of_1_year_refuses_to/)

Essentially the post is about how some dude in the office (27M) won’t speak to OP (24F) and the other women at the office. He won’t talk with them about anything other than work with the girls, but is friends with the guys. However, he is cordial and will exchange some basic pleasantries (have a good day etc). In other words, he is being a normal coworker and OP doesn’t like that.

Now here’s the twist. OP said that one of the girls is considering go to HR about this because she is saying its creating a hostile work environment. This is the part that really pissed me off. Now I acknowledge that maybe the majority of women aren't like this, don't generalize blah blah blah I get it. However, it's not that every woman will, but that any woman can. This is the exact same situation as the google manager in a thread that got posted a while back where the guy got fired for not responding to a female coworker's advances. So the idea that this is an impossible scenario is simply false.

There is simply no winning anymore. Now if you follow the Pence rule, you can be punished for that to.   Act friendly with a woman and ask her out or show interest, and you get punished or fired for harassment. Okay. Men adapt. Now, you act professional with a woman, and her and her friends get upset that this is a hostile work environment and want to report this to HR. If a man does A he gets in trouble. If he does B he gets in trouble. If he reverses course and does Z or Y he gets in trouble as well. If he says f the system it's all BS and goes MGTOW, then he gets labelled incel, misogynist, sexist.

It is promising however that pretty much everyone in the thread called OP out for her total BS, but the simple fact that a group of women would even think to do this is just insane. I suspect (this is just my opinion) that the man is attractive, she showed interest, he says no thanks let's talk about work, and she takes it personally and builds a *hostile work environment* in her mind because she can't fathom that someone doesn't want to be best buddies with her *at work* and just wants to be professional. More attention-seeking bullshit. Nobody is entitled to friendship to anyone, but somehow this is too much to comprehend for some people. Imagine being so fragile that someone not being your best friend makes you feel uncomfortable. It honestly seems to me that she and the other girls at the office are harassing him. Rules for thee but not for me. I shoot you for no reason, but I am the victim.

Imagine if a group of guys went to HR and said, ""we feel upset that a female coworker at the office won't talk with us"". They would be annihilated. This is just complete delusion.

If everyone is to be paid the same, tests should be gender neutral. This would also account for genders other than male or female that people would like to be identified.

Physical fitness test should be cater to the job, not the gender. Military is a profession, not a welfare program.

This webpage, although a little outdated, gives a brief outline of the scoring standards for fitness tests of all US military services. ([https://mybaseguide.com/military-fitness-tests/](https://mybaseguide.com/military-fitness-tests/))

The one for the Army is a little outdated. The former test, APFT, was gender discriminatory. The new test, ACFT was initially supposed to be gender neutral. Then they changed it to where the scoring would be gender neutral, but females would get more promotion points for the same score. Then they changed one component of the test, from the leg tuck to the plank, and also made the scoring gender discriminatory. The most recent scoring for the test is ([https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/acft/ACFT\_scoring\_scales\_220323.pdf](https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/acft/ACFT_scoring_scales_220323.pdf)) .

I also hold the view that physical tests should also be AGE neutral. In the case of jobs or ranks that don't require high physical standards, make the physical tests less demanding ( a General doesn't need the same physical fitness as an infantryman/infantrywoman/infantryperson ).

FYI, the intelligence test for the US military is called the ASVAB, and is gender neutral.

For the argument that females bring skills other than physical fitness, if any such skill is important, it should be measured in a gender neutral way.

In case they need females for a specific task, a temporary limited exemption may be made (example: Cultural Support Teams that were useful in Muslim countries).  But a service wide exemption is unfair.

For the argument that females are generally less stronger that males and that should be accounted for: There is no reason to give special exceptions to any category. Why don't we categorize by height then? Why not by eye color, or hair color? What about gender makes it necessary to categorize by that?

I've discussed this idea with them, and none of them are advocates of women's rights like you read on the internet, or hear about radical feminists.

The feminists live in a world where they create this pseudo-oppression for themselves, and blame it on men.  Subsequently they feel the need to try and take rights away from men.  Equality for women is already here.  Feminists don't want equality, they want power.

&#x200B;

This LinkedIn study from 2019 used their internal data to examine differences between men and women when job searching. Among the key findings are the fact that men and women view a similar number of jobs though women apply to 20% fewer. A recruiter is 13% more likely to view a man's profile which she described as result of a problematic bias that must be corrected (even though they also found that recruiters will still contact both genders at equal rates).

However, the author (Maria Ignatova) makes no effort to hide her own bias (and sexism) by writing:

>The good news is that when women do apply to a job, they are 16% more likely than men to get hired. In fact, if the role is more senior than their current position, that number goes up to 18%.  
>  
>While this is an uplifting stat, it does show that women do a very thorough job at vetting roles — sometimes maybe too thorough. If women only apply when they feel extremely qualified, this could also indicate they are not pursuing stretch opportunities.

Linkedin is a mainstream website, not a fringe feminist blog. Yet blatant discrimination in hiring practices is celebrated as ""good news"" and as ""uplifting stat(s)"". This doesn't lead to equality, it's just another piece of evidence that equality isn't the actual goal.

Her analysis is also very weak and uses the usual strategy of reframing all issues so that women are the real victims. I think a more plausible hypothesis for why men apply to 20% more jobs is because if we are getting rejected more often then we need to submit more applications to increase our chances of finding work. Of course I would submit fewer if I was getting offers at 16-18% higher rate.

For most of us, this is just seeing statistics that support what we already knew is happening. The worst part is just being gaslit, and told this is ""equality"" and if we have a problem with it we are misogynist or examples of ""toxic masculinity"".

I live on the property of a private boat club, the property is gated, fenced, and has no trespassing signs all over. I live here to keep non-members out of the property as we are located on the water in a large park. 

Tonight I come home from work and do my walk around the property, as I do everyday, and I came across to young women sunbathing on one of the docks. I asked if they were members, they said no, and asked the to politely leave because this is private property. That's when they started to call me a perv, they can do what thay want, on and on. I am a very level headed person and let them rant and I calmly assed them to leave. They called 911 and screaming that some creepy old perv was harassing them. 

After a few minutes the police show up. Two female police. One goes and talks to the girls, the other talks to me. I explain to here that I live here and it is my job as caretaker to keep people from trespassing on the property. All the while the girls are getting all emotional with the other officer using words like creepy, they felt threatened, rape, the whole 9 yards. The 2 officers talk alone, then come over and cuff me risk me, take my wallet, phone, and keys, then seat me in the back of my car while they check my background and a warren search. All the while the two sunbathing girls are all giddy about me being in cuffs and taking my pic and text/posting like crazy. 

After about 15 minutes they take me out of the car and cuffs, and tell me I am free to go. (Go where? I fucking live here!) They then ask the girls, who are pissed that I was uncuffed, if they wanted to file a report against me, but they would have to leave the property. 

So for doing my job, on private property where I live, I end up in handcuffs for being considered ""creepy"" by doing my job. 

The officers never asked me if I wanted to file charges against them for trespassing.....of course. 

Update #1: I woke up this morning and my just venting on here blew up. I've replied to a few comments. I spoke to the board members of the club and we agree that in the future I should just call the non emergency number for the police and to record it. I also contacted a member who is a retired from the state supreme court and she told me ""that is utter bullshit"" as to how I was detained and she is putting a call into the police chief. I appreciate all the support, thank you!

Update #2: I recieved a phone call from the police departments internal affairs division today, they took a statement from me and are going to look into how the officers handled the call. I should hear something in a few weeks. I got the names of of the two girls who were tresspassing. So far I have not found any pics of me cuffed in the back of the car. 
  

Update #3, It has been over a month since I filed my complaint over be handcuffed, detained, questioned, and background checked. So this afternoon was low at work and I called the CPD internal affairs division to find out the status of my complaint against the officers. Well over 45 minutes being put on, on and off hold, I was told that there is no record of the report. I have the report number and they can't seem to find it.

is a very proud feminist. I am the only male in the class. This is a small college so she is teaching the entire program. The man bashing was getting out of hand and I had enough. So I wrote her this email regarding some of my issues in the class:

Hello R\*\*\*,

I am not happy in your classes. I feel that it is the duty of the instructor to present the material as unbiased as possible, and as a proud feminist you do not do that. These issues are not new, I have been feeling this way for a long time. However, it was on Wednesday of last week that I reached my breaking point. In my twenties I may have identified as a feminist, but I’ve grown since. I do not support the feminist ideology. I believe in equal rights, but “woke feminism” is a joke at best, and very dangerous at its worst. I realize that you are very passionate about your feminist beliefs, but I am not, and I do not want to hear it in the classroom any longer. I have requested several times to transfer to another class however B\*\*\*\*\*n is not responding to my emails. I can no longer sit quietly on this. Until they can find another class for me to join, I will be joining your lectures, but I will do minimal participation. I will not answer questions, and my camera will be off. Topics such as mansplaining, manspreading and the pay gap are non-issues. Mansplaining is a feminist tactic to silence men, manspreading is due to biology, the pay gap is due to the difference choices that men and women make. To pay someone differently for the same job with the same qualifications is illegal and every time they look for it in the West, they repeatedly find men as the underpaid gender, if it exists at all. Just look at what happened with women’s soccer in the US and the BBC in the UK. There is no Patriarchy, just a hierarchy based upon competence, with the most competent rising to the top. And that is just the tip of the iceberg.

Feminism is an ideology based upon victimhood and I will not be a part of that belief system.

It is because I like and respect you that I am writing this email. If it was not for that, I would not have returned.

One last point, men make up 95% of war casualties. The ones that do survive are traumatized, disfigured and never the same. To say that women and children are the biggest victims of war, was deeply offensive. If one considers all people as equals and you can still regard women and children as the biggest victims of war, something is very wrong with your reasoning. Most of those men that died; died protecting our borders so we can be safe and enjoy our lives in peace. Do not discredit their sacrifices. None of them wanted to die, but that was the cost of our freedom.

Sincerely,

My professor's reply was sent through Bongo. Our classes are all online. I didn't realize that Bongo does not automatically save private messages. The gist of her reply was that she apologized for making me feel uncomfortable in class and she wants to talk with me face to face about my issues with the class. I actually have a good relationship with the professor. I do have the support of all the students in the classroom. The day of the incident where she was particularly man bashing I commented that there was ""too much man hating going on"". The rest of the class either apologized or came to my defense. I really like my classmates. I then went completely silent for the rest of the week and did not join her class. 

In class I've been referred to as ""one of the good ones"" which I find particularly patronizing. I actually do like my professor and we do have some good debates. I am the only one to challenge her opinions in class and she respects that.

212,tcyo1p,2022-03-13,MensRights,"Australian report by feminist organisation claims support for men's rights is a ""significant barrier to gender equality""","This report summarises a survey of Australians with regards to attitudes towards gender equality and was conducted by a feminist organisation which is, as they all are, solely focused on things like getting more female CEOs and more women elected to political office.

There is some good news in the report and the feminists must have burned in anger at having to write it. For example:

>**Men have been forgotten in the struggle for gender equality**  
>  
>Our survey reveals a worrying statistic in this regard: nearly half of all male respondents “agreed or strongly agreed” with the statement that “gender equality strategies in the workplace do not take men into account”. If we disaggregate the data by generation, we find that while millennial and builder males were most likely to report feelings of being left out, all generations exhibited similar sentiments. Millennial males were also significantly more likely (48 per cent) to “agree/strongly agree” with the statement that “Men and boys are increasingly excluded from measures to improve gender equality”, followed by Gen Z males at 44 per cent. Gender equality measures are not the only interventions that are perceived by men to deepen, rather than fix existing inequalities. The highly contested concept of freedom of speech also reveals significant gendered differences, with men far more likely to say that political correctness benefits women in the workplace.

This section is surprisingly revealing of feminist motivations. I'm surprised they would include this in a public report:

>**Male moderates are champions of men’s rights**  
>  
>The moderate perspective combines an egalitarian set of views around gender equality in the workplace and at home with rising concern over what they understand as the growing impact of political correctness in Australian society, as well as a strong desire to see men’s rights equally represented in public discussion of equality issues. Given that 62 per cent of Australians align with the moderate position and its value system, this represents a significant barrier to gender equality.

Got that?

Feminists think that concerns for men's rights and a desire to see men treated equally to women are an obstacle to feminists achieving the goals that they dishonestly label ""equality"".

Other stats cited include:

* 41% of Australian men believe that political correctness gives women an advantage in the workplace
* 46% of Australian men believe that gender equality measures do not take men into account
* 42% of Australian men believe that men and boys are increasingly excluded from measures to improve gender equality

The feminist authors fear that these popular and growing attitudes could result in a ""backlash"" against feminist initiatives and ""backsliding"" away from the goals which they're pursuing.

Of course, any time that feminists are unhappy or even hysterical it is good news for men and for progress towards true equality. I see this report as quite positive.

SO WHY AM I NOT INCLUDED IN THAT? Legitimately it's like tear jerking to read fantastic policies that could uplift the material conditions of people... be specifically, explicitly and exclusively not welcome to you specifically due to nebulous concepts such as white privilege.

228,110i701,2023-02-12,stupidpol,Why the internet's learn-to-code obsession is baseless,"I understand this is a bit niche, but if you spend enough time around the internet, particularly reddit, you'll find loads of people claiming to work in the information technology/software/computers space, either as developers or ancillary occupations. If you fall into the right mainstream circles, such as career advice forums, they're completely inundated with an obsession for information technology, finance, blue collar trades, and a smattering of other careers. Anecdotally, it seems the job market in western society is becoming increasingly concentrated.

This career advice pushing youth towards tech is frequently accompanied by unsubstantiated claims of a ""shortage"" of human capital within the tech sector (despite admitting that there is also a large amount of job rationing, which is obvious cognitive dissonance). They cite examples of many mega-cap companies being borne from the tech sector, and that digitization is increasing, therefore developers will always be well-paid and in demand, i.e. it's a good career choice. 

Before I continue, please let me make three things clear:

1. General purpose computing/technology is incredibly powerful, and yes, there are large macroeconomic forces driving its continued adoption in all sorts of industries,

2. I do believe that information technology has brought many benefits to humanities and, for all its ills, has also alleviated a degree of human suffering, and

3. If you need to learn a trade, learning to make software is a decent choice. It is also accessible and personally rewarding.

That said, I recently listened to [this podcast episode,](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3NTusQGtqIE1Sop2EoJd9F?si=0cca9c5ffe564e4f) (Revolutions 10.3 - The Three Pillars of Marxism) in which Mike Duncan (the host) discusses, among other things, the division of labor, and how it serves to alienate workers from the products of labor, and recognize their value as human capital.

Oddly, the first chapter of [The Wealth of Nations](https://youtu.be/7pFD7xcKb1U) by Adam Smith also talks extensively about the benefits of the division of labor, by allowing for workers specification and comparative advantage. Everyone agrees that the division of labor can increase productivity and pushes down labor costs.

Anyways, to tie this all together:

Reddit's learn-to-code fetishism is already outdated, if it ever applied at all. I've worked in the tech industry for some time now and the division of labor has reached a point where most software developers, in addition to being at the base of the power structure of these companies, the bitch boys that do most of the work while a handful of MBAs make all the money, are effectively alienated from the products they produce. While it can be done (example: PUBG), it is increasingly difficult for small or one man dev teams to consistently compete with major industry players. **The software industry, while still relatively well-paid for the time being, is set on a course to become the factory floor of the 21st century.** More concerningly, software is setting trends for a highly fractured, insecure employment market moving forward. **White collar workers, who were previously able to rideout economic meltdowns in developed economies, like the US in the 1980s, will find themselves pushed into the labor class from the PMC class.** Pumping the brakes on the learn-to-code train, or at least creating class consciousness in this PMC->prole class, would be extremely beneficial to developed economies.

> The traditional and vulgarized type of the intellectual is given by the Man of Letters, the philosopher, and the artist. Therefore, journalists, who claim to be men of letters, philosophers, artists, also regard themselves as the ""true"" intellectuals. In the modern world, technical education, closely bound to industrial labour, even at the most primitive and unqualified level, must form the basis of the new type of intellectual. . . . The mode of being of the new intellectual can no longer consist of eloquence, which is an exterior and momentary mover of feelings and passions, but in active participation in practical life, as constructor [and] organizer, as ""permanent persuader"", not just simple orator.

Both at woke companies.,"I graduated last spring, got a stem degree because “tHaTs wHeRe tHe fUtUrE iS”, relocated to a city seven hours away and then got laid off with over 500 others only four months later because they decided all our departments were too expensive and they could hire the same number of visa workers for a third less. The same day they posted about how excited they were that “the majority of our leadership positions are now held by women” on all their accounts.

Fast forward to now, I managed to get another job, still with a Fortune 500 unfortunately, had to relocate a second time. It’s a large industrial company, yesterday on a quarterly earnings call the CFO explains leadership is happy Biden won because, and I quote “now that Trumps tariffs are gone we can start moving some of the more expensive production we have here to our more economical regions, and with restrictions on visas now gone we can bring in much more (cheap) talent”. Visas regularly impact my field first and my manager said don’t be surprised if layoffs of domestic workers take place. But while the CFO giddily talks about outsourcing thousands of jobs and bringing in immigrant workers to fill the ones they can’t, every social media page was bragging about how the executive leadership is now minorities and the new chief counsel is a black woman.

I apologize for the long rant, but I am so exhausted by the corporate class fucking over American workers, normally forming actually real diverse teams of background, education, religion, etc, and just shipping in homogenous groups of workers because then they can give middle management extra bonuses.

246,u4gnwj,2022-04-15,stupidpol,Idpol in the service industry,"I've been lurking here for a while and thought you guys might like to hear about something that happened to me recently. If you want, please share your own stories about how you've seen idpol used as an excuse to treat service workers like shit.

I'm 26 and have been working in restaurants since I was 18. If you've worked service, you know that shit customers transcend all politics and identity markers. It is a myth that white women are the only Karens. A black lady with an IN THIS HOUSE, WE BELIEVE sign is just as likely to ruin your night as a guy who looks like he owns 3 giant trucks.

I worked at a self consciously liberal restaurant that prides itself on giving us a living wage. It is not a socialist utopia but it's much better than most places and we get about 20-30 applications for every job we post.

Part of the restaurant's vibe is that we don't use Uber Eats or Door Dash or any of that shit because they treat their employees like shit. But since we're not web developers that means that if a customer wants to make a carryout order or place reservations they have to actually pick up a phone and call us.

We were very busy last weekend, like we normally are. Two younger women (maybe 22-23) come in and ask for a table. I tell them we might be able to get them seated at the bar. They say they can't do that because it's too crowded. I'm thinking ""well this whole place is crowded,"" but whatever, I said it would be 30-45 minutes before they got a table. They looked pissed off, but that's normal when people are told they have to wait. They took a seat.

Maybe ten minutes later another couple comes in. They had a reservation and so I took them to their table right away. When I get back to the host stand, one of the girls who was waiting was sobbing. Not crying, but visibly heaving and shaking like she just found out someone had died. 

I'm not a monster so I went over and asked what was wrong and if we could help. That's when I noticed the other girl was filming me with her phone. Normally we tell people to stop right away but I basically froze. 

Then the other girl started screaming so loud the entire place got quiet. She said I had discriminated against them. She said I the restaurant was biphobic. I was panicking because this is the best job I've ever had and I had no idea what she was talking about. I said something like ""How would I know you're bi?"" 

I don't remember exactly what she said but she was mad that I had seated the ""cis couple"" before them. I explained that they had reservations and, now that I knew what going on was bullshit, I got a little mad and told them that if they wanted to get seated right away they should have made reservations. She said she tried but our ""shitty ass website"" (which is an accurate description) didn't let her. I explained how you have to call, and she said she can't call strangers because of her anxiety and that along with being biphobic we were also ableist.

By this point the manager came out and angrily told them to get the fuck out. He's a big dude and they didn't fight him. But they did send the video to the owner the next day demanding to know my name and all of my social media and told him they'd never come back if I wasn't fired. He told them to fuck off, and so far I haven't seen the video on social media so thank god for that.",charmingyoungman05,t2_jbxais75,0.98,520,130
249,za63z4,2022-12-02,stupidpol,"The Railroad Strike would present a critical juncture in the history of the nation -- let alone labor -- if they go ahead and do it illegally, and they should.","I wouldn't blame the workers if they don't do this or just decide to resign en masse (there are already unprecedented resignations in the industry). People have families. The security state is far more advanced than it ever was in the later 19th/early 20th century. They *will* attack.

Yet, there is simply no avoiding the fact that illegal strikes and a lot of dirty play (let's say, for example, rail workers sabotage lines) are necessary. Power isn't going to just give up anything, not a single thing. It is naive in the extreme to think otherwise, such as to be historically illiterate.

They'd likely need even broader public support, however, and the support of many other unions as well. Breaking the picket line needs to be a serious offense shamed and punished in the way same way it once was over 100 years ago.

I try to discuss this with middle-class liberals I know, the same types who King would have written about in jail. While they profess to care for the poor and support labor, the fact is that you can't both support rail workers and support Democrats.

Democrats don't ever get anything done not because they're blocked, but because they don't want to and are generally openly anti-labor. If the only time you promote policies that would help working-class people (such as this or the failed student loan forgiveness) is when it's very predictable it will fail rather than when you have the power or opportunity, you're gaslighting voters.

To continue supporting or defending Biden when he is attacking workers like this is to self-identify as an elitist with no love or care for the poor. These are the same liberals who continue to speak of Reagan's evils from decades ago; Biden here is mimicking Reagan's treatment of the air traffic control strikers, a monumental moment in modern American political history that left us all poorer.

'Demonstrate a baseline consistency in values,' I'll suggest to them, but since Biden has been elected, liberals haven't seemed to have the courage to so much as attempt a feeble answer to the abuses of their sports team. That Biden is a cruel, petty corporate sycophant was obvious throughout his political history, yet people who ostensibly care about the poor continue to offer their support even as he and the party continue to viciously hurt families.

It has to be illegal. It has to come at a cost. There is just no other way anymore. Labor needs to get its balls back, and we collectively have to unplug from what Terrance McKenna once called 'shit-brained thinking' generated by an electronic \[corporate\] media that today has become so ubiquitous as to see people marching themselves into the slaughter house:

*""We have to stop consuming our culture. We have to create culture. Don't watch TV. Don't read magazines. Don't even listen to NPR. Create your own roadshow.""*

Labor has to 'create its own roadshow' or this country is simply doomed. Part of that will have to include unplugging from liberal media, liberal credetialism, liberal essentialism, moralism, and 'values,' grabbing at the power labor has with little to no regard for the 'laws' written by a class of businessmen and lawyers who can only be described as genocidal (note that by 'liberal,' I include 'neoliberalism' in my meaning, which in my view encompasses most of the country's 'conservative' and centrist politics).

I know that for many members of this sub, this is preaching to the choir. Basic materialist analysis. But historical moments like this impress upon us all the urgency of action in the face of unconscionable evil.

I agree that the barriers are absolutely tremendous, that we are dealing with a new kind of digital oppression, but since the alternative is increasing death and destitution, there is no choice but to try and find a way.

During the course of a single hour, various speakers and audience members made the following claims, all of which were met with uniform affirmation:

* All surgeries and medical procedures trace their roots to anti-black eugenics
* Doctors are trained to believe that black people are a different species
* There exists a nation-wide network of white kidnappers who abduct ""hundreds of thousands"" of black American children each year
* Before colonization ""all of Africa"" shared a single, unified culture and there were no wars
* Before colonization, Africans had no understanding of personal property or forms of currency (ironically, this line used to be popular with Stormfront posters and apartheid apologists)

This list doesn't even include more popular insane arguments, like that the average lifespan of a trans woman is 35 or that all policing started with slave patrols.

I don't know exactly when it was determined that terms like ""prostitute,"" ""stripper,"" ""camgirl,"" ""porn star"" were demeaning to their subjects and must be replaced by the catch-all euphemism ""sex worker,"" but a consequence of the shift has been the distortion of any conversation involving any or all of those jobs.

It seems to me there's a difference in kind between, say, receiving a one-time payment from a stranger in exchange for penetrative sex and receiving payment from cloud-mediated strangers in exchange for nude photos of oneself (a similar distinction exists between ""impoverished runaway under the thumb of organized crime"" and ""adventurous grad student in NYC who gets to pick and choose""), but it's hard to have a nuanced discussion about any of it when it's all made fungible under the ""sex worker"" classification.

Like anyone with a set of eyeballs and over the age of 30, I have been tracking the evolution of the family as presented to television audiences. 

It is well known that for a very long time “media”in general  lagged behind reality in this regard. The entire planet was white and straight with clearly defined cookie cutter roles. This began to change in in the 70s and then accelerated dramatically as we exited the 80s. 

In the 90s and 2000s I would posit that the universe as reflected on television was pretty close to mirroring the actual diversity of at least the United States. I mean this in regard to representation on a statistical basis. Obviously diffferent products have different target demographics. This is not what I am referencing. 

I think that it should be a non-controversial observation to point out that this is no longer reality and has not been for a time. There is an over representation of just about everything. I won’t get into the “why” behind this as it isn’t germane to this particular discussion.   

I have said all this to say that I just watched a commercial that revolved around Christmas dinner and  have finally reached the point of incredulity. In a nuclear family + spouses (young children strangely missing) we had the following eating dinner together at the table:

Mom: beautiful Hispanic woman

For those of you industry and non industry friends following this story. I unfortunately have some first hand insight. :(


My thoughts are regret that I didn't say something earlier when I worked for this production company -Thomasville Pictures- in Feburary as a Thomasville Local. When I and multiple department heads including the prop master expressed shock for safety issues and poor planning concerning the very basics of set safety and common sense to multiple producers and were dismissed or just outright taken off the department head meeting schedule (no pay) or off the days shoot entirely.


1. This was totally avoidable. There are safety protocols in place, which is why this tragedy is so rare. Non industry but Thomasville friends... think Union Job.


2. I worked for this production company #ThomasvillePictures as a SAG Aftra stunt coordinator this year. I raised safety concerns during my employment. That was my job. I was not asked to be a part of their future projects. I had to educate producers on blanks, Class C explosives licence for SPFX department head, and numerous other concerns from car hits to any other type of crap you could think of. They had no idea what they were doing. I wouldn't let them around a horse none the less a gun. They dont know how to make the movies they are making.

3. This was a real gun and real bullet on set. Unforgivable.


4. The gun was taken for target practice by the propmasters daughter before filming. Ridiculous.


5. The gun was not checked on set. Insane.


6. The producers hired non union crew to film that day when their crew walked out for safety concerns the day before. That's when filming should have stopped.


7. There is a difference between a prop master and an armorer for a reason. They know better. Because I told them in Feburary.


8. The producers are responsible and ultimately negligent for hiring non union workers and not checking their work. Manslaughter.


9. Alec Baldwin is a union actor and a producer on the film Rust. Hes one of the bosses.


10. Thomasville Pictures is an unsafe production company. They cut corners and didnt hire union professionals. Thomasville let's them do everything for free. They got someone killed and should never be allowed to make movies again.


11. The prop master of the film One Way walked off of set for safety concers. Just like this movie. Foreshadowing 
How many people need to walk off a movie set or say they feel unsafe before a producer will listen?


Send your thoughts and prayers to the families of Halyna Hutchins and Joel Souza not the producers of this film. It's not an accident. Its negligence. They dont know what they are doing. Everyone should claim responsibility for their incompetence instead of filming a western when they dont even know basic set or weapon safety. The best outcome is that these producers aren't allowed to make anymore movies and send every $ they saved being cheap to the child of Halyna Hutchins.""",Leandover,t2_bdsc9,0.99,211,111

Especially on social media, reddit including, you can go to any left wing socialist spaces and find little to no information regarding policy proposals, current events (outside of outrage mongering), or discussion of theory. It's all progressive activism and reactionary tantrums with zero substance. I just fail to see the connecting line between an industry co-opted by capitalist billionaires around a community of historically disenfranchised people now sitting in a position of highest privilege culturally is at all relevant to left wing ideology, or in any way conducive to the betterment of people's lives.

I can understand the historical context of LGBT activism aligning with left wing ideals as a means of fighting the evangelical right of the 20th century, but nowadays it really seems like nobody gives a shit about poor working class people completely left out to dry. In fact, a majority of the time, I see self proclaimed leftists actively scorning the uneducated, working class labor force in America especially, usually while browsing twitter as they work their 25 hour week from a cushy stay-at-home coding job.

Enough of my personal opinions though, can you explain where the disconnect comes from? I doubt it needs to be said, but I don't have anything against these communities or, more specifically, individuals belonging to these communities. It just seems like a big waste of time and a way for those in power to keep us distracted from affecting actual change for the betterment of the people without. What are we fighting for, exactly?

328,vwt1na,2022-07-11,stupidpol,[longpost][effort] The US education system is on the brink of total collapse and we're all completely screwed.,"I've been keeping up with what's going on in education because \~children are the future~ and holy shit, we're in deep trouble. The system is currently being assaulted from multiple angles, and while COVID is a major factor in its dysfunction, it's really more of an accelerant for trends that have been ongoing for years. Here's a completely unscientific and non-comprehensive breakdown of why our future generations are going to be non-functional:

#**The Society**

We all know how little trust US culture has in education, so no point in spilling more pixels on it

#**The Parents**  
This section is going to be mostly anecdotal because crawling through parenting publications makes my eyes bleed, but I've been watching this shit go on for years so whatever. Even beyond factors like SES and family structure (for the sake of brevity I won't get into factors largely beyond parents' control), there's a vast body of evidence pointing to the fact that how parents parent has a large effect on what their children turn into. Research consistently demonstrates that children of parents with authoritative [parenting styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting_styles) [have the best outcomes](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407520960818), [including in academic achievement](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10834-015-9444-5), while children of parents with permissive and neglectful parenting styles consistently underperform. It is perhaps these parents that demonstrate the  [involvement and high expectations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1747938X18301027) in their children's education that are also linked to success. 

Ok here's where it gets anecdotal. In my completely unscientific observation, parenting trends have shifted to become extremely permissive (see: [attachment parenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_parenting) which gets completely fucking bonkers once you scratch past the surface). Although it's good that it's no longer acceptable to beat children, it seems to have become normal for parents to attempt to shy away from even mild forms of discipline and thus fail to correct problematic behaviors. Without authoritative (even authoritarian would be better) parents providing their children with structure through a system that mixes reward to enforce good behavior and punishment to extinguish bad behavior, they'll be ill-equipped for the classroom.

But there's something even more pernicious happening than granola parenting- parents are exposing their children to long periods of screen time from a very early age. This poses a serious, serious problem; in [early childhood](https://academic.oup.com/pch/article/11/9/571/2648303?login=true), people's brains rapidly adapt to the environment they're being brought up into -- for example, aboriginal australians develop very strong spatial cognition to survive terrain with few landmarks. Parents who give their children regular access to youtube kids and tiktok are literally, unironically giving their brains permission to permanently adapt to a world of rapidly-changing, oversaturated, narrative-free stimuli. Even the most structured parenting can't overcome that.

#**The School Boards**    
School board positions across the country are typically filled with elected or politician-appointed members that pander to what voters or politicians want in order to obtain and keep their jobs. Despite the fact that BOE appointees don't have to have any understanding of how education works, they hold immense power over the school districts they oversee. Like publicly-traded companies, school boards show their stakeholders (voters) that they're successful through quantitative metrics like operation costs and graduation rates, which, like publicly-traded companies, often leads them to do things to boost these short-term metrics at the expense of meaningful long-term goals. Examples of common and extremely destructive policies commonly put into place to cook the books are 'avoid Fs at all costs' (i.e. shuffling kids along until they graduate barely literate), 'avoid suspensions or expulsions at all costs' (more warm bodies = more funding), and 'create an inclusive environment' (i.e. eliminate SPED resources to save money). 

Of course, they are also increasingly expected to achieve ideological wins that at best do nothing to improve education quality. With education having become ground zero for COVID and culture wars, the true value of schooling to many voters and BOEs across the country (a low-cost babysitting service that hands out good grades and diplomas and doesn't teach anything that challenges what area parents are trying to indoctrinate their kids into) has been laid bare.  

# **The Administrators**

Over the past couple decades, the education system has shifted into a 'the customer is always right' service model. As with school boards, admins are concerned with boosting their quant metrics so that their schools appear to be 'good'. Their preoccupation with numbers like graduation rates, in addition to their fear of angry parents, has made behaviors like [grade inflation](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED598893), [shuffling unprepared kids through the system](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-functionally-illiterate-students-allowed-to-graduate-from-high-school) instead of holding them back until they learn the material (which makes catching up increasingly harder to the point where we end up with high schoolers ([and college students](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/12/16/graduated-not-literate)) who are [functionally illiterate](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2020/10/27/reading-level-math-test-scores-high-school-seniors/3746305001/)) and [refusing to discipline](https://www.live5news.com/2022/01/07/charleston-county-school-district-sued-over-workplace-safety/) disruptive students (who [hinder learning outcomes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775715000059) for the rest of the class).   

Like fresh-faced middle-managers, school administrators are often on the look-out for feel-good trends they can adopt (or pay lip-service to) to demonstrate to parents and teachers that their schools are on the bleeding edge of developments in education theory -- but without making tough, expensive, or unpopular changes that might actually improve student outcomes. In fact, the ways in which these concepts are implemented tend to conveniently cut costs (e.g. special ed staff) or improve metrics (e.g. disciplinary actions) while passing additional burden onto the teachers and tanking education quality for students. A historical example that is now deeply-entrenched within education systems internationally is [mainstreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstreaming_\(education\)), which likely [harms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775721000406) [student performance](https://www.eui.eu/Documents/DepartmentsCentres/Economics/Seminarsevents/Balestra.pdf). A more recent example is [restorative justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice); [extremely hard to implement correctly in the classroom](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-019-01013-2), these programs often amount to admins [allowing students to engage in disruptive or even violent behavior consequence-free](https://isthmus.com/news/cover-story/rotten-year/), with nary a hint of 'restoration' or 'justice' involved.

The burden of executing administrative and school board vision lies almost entirely on the backs of teachers. Faced with feral kids who are often so far behind that they're literally incapable of understanding class material, a directive to prevent kids from failing at all costs, and [job](https://core.ac.uk/reader/345094950) [creep](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/213926/1/2021_EI_Research_StatusOfTeachers_ENG_FINAL.pdf), the role of the teacher shifts from teaching to meeting the ever-changing whims of parents and superiors. But at least administrators ~~force them to suffer through team building exercise-tier bullshit~~ generously invest in their future through [professional development](https://hechingerreport.org/new-report-reveals-that-teacher-professional-development-is-costly-and-ineffective/)!

#**The Teachers**

Faced with disrespectful and even hostile parents, unsupportive admins, stingy and politically-motivated school boards, and hellraising students, teaching is no longer a viable career path. Contrary to the common wisdom that 'those who can't do, teach', a high proportion of teachers -- particularly highly-needed specialists -- enter the field from [other backgrounds](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-teacher-shortage-is-real-large-and-growing-and-worse-than-we-thought-the-first-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/) because they want to help our youngest citizens thrive. If teachers can no longer teach, the profession is treated with disrespect, and licensing requirements (particularly for those much-needed specialists) are [extremely time-consuming and costly](https://www.alleducationschools.com/teacher-certification/)...who's going to want to be a teacher?

You may have noticed that most of the links in this longpost are pre-pandemic. Even back then, [attrition rates and teacher shortages](https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/) were so high that schools in some areas [were hiring teachers from the Philippines](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/schools-in-illinois-florida-arizona-and-colorado-hiring-teachers-from-philippines-to-fight-staff-shortages) to fill in the gaps. With COVID and culture war bullshit to contend with, teachers are now [starting to quit and retire en masse](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/04/teachers-quitting-jobs-covid-record-numbers), and teaching program enrollment [has declined](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/10/28/teacher-education-programs-continue-suffer-death-thousand-cuts) to the point where those positions can't conceivably be filled.

#The kids

They're reportedly quite often little shits who are incapable of engaging in activities that require critical thinking, creative thinking, or attention, but given how much adults are failing them, who's to blame?

#**Predictions for the future**

The deterioration of the public education system (+ parenting) is quite possibly one of the biggest risks to the future of the country. Some predictions for the next decade and beyond:

* **Upward class mobility will be next to impossible for US natives**: Children who aren't placed in high-quality private schools won't have the skills necessary to obtain a college degree. The secondary education system may be faced with relaxing its standards to shuffle people through (which has been happening, albeit at a much slower pace than K-12), thus further devaluing US bachelor's degrees and leading companies that can afford to be discriminating to require more proof of skill (i.e. low- and unpaid internships) before investing in young workers.
* **More immigration will be necessary to maintain economic output in key sectors**: Because we won't produce enough skilled workers ourselves, we'll need to import more skilled workers from developing countries to work in sectors that require both a degree and talent.
* **Young adults won't be able to engage in critical thinking or reading**: This is already a problem that the country faces due to poor-quality parenting and poor liberal arts education, but it'll intensify, which has implications not only for how they think about politics but things like susceptibility to scams.
* **Young adults won't be equipped with the ability to engage in long-term planning**: The aforementioned poor-quality parenting and poor liberal arts education will leave young adults unequipped with long-term planning skills and the ability to delay gratification, leading to an increasing adoption of exploitative gig work and financial illiteracy. This is already happening among zoomers
* **A vicious gutting cycle**: As is the case with other social programs, the deterioration of the public education system will provide conservatives with justification to further destroy the system because why invest in it if it's not working? This is likely part of the strategy for some of the recent state attempts to relax qualification standards.",snallygaster,t2_4vggm,0.95,751,335

367,hfhdty,2020-06-25,stupidpol,I have a theory as to why rural working class people identify more with capitalism than with socialism.,"I lived in a small banana town for a year and a half. I ended up having many conversations about our local welfare distribution center, the character of the people who needed it, and so-on. 

Every day you'd see roughly two or three waves of employees go to work. You'd see the 5am shift, which is when the farm labourers, council workers, and just about anyone surrounding the agricultural industry begin to start their work. 

Then there was the 8am shift, which is when the cafes, banks, shops, schools, and any other indoors, air-conditioned business began to open.

Then there were the casual workers and the unemployed, which generally hung around town during the day without doing anything in particular. 

So if we look at the labour theory of value, exploitation is a dollar earned by an owner of the means of production was a dollar not paid to the worker. When the 5am starters would finish their shift in the afternoon, they'd leave work, go past the shops, buy some cigarettes and some alcohol to relax and they'd see the unemployed hanging around in the parks.

Of course everybody knew that the unemployed were getting benefits, and some were getting extra money to have their students attend a certain number of school days. While the farm workers would see the people who own the farm right alongside them; they drove tractors, fixed leaking pipes, and were workers themselves that happened to own property. While the unemployed owned nothing, and did nothing, and were rewarded with a wage as well. 

So these conservative laborers saw themselves in distinct categories - people who work hard (labourers and business owners) - people who work easy jobs (bankers, baristas) and people who didn't work at all, but still being paid.  Those are the lines that they divide themselves along.

The people who are on unemployment benefits are seen as the rent-seekers that we accuse the bourgeoisie as being. When I defended the unemployment payments and people who didn't want to work, I tried to remind them of the people who earned millions, if not billions of dollars in profit in a given year. There's a limit to how much someone can work, but not a limit to how much they can be paid. 

""Well, it's because they're smart enough to figure out how to make that money in the first place.""

I think they'd be ripe for the picking to be converted to socialists if they were exposed to more examples of the wealthy class exploiting the workers and living off the labour of others on several orders of magnitude more than welfare recipients. But I just thought it was interesting how this worked, and I got to see the other side of it.",Feynmanprinciple,t2_6mk97j7y,0.94,206,141
370,xkgzsu,2022-09-21,stupidpol,I am rationing diabetes prescriptions because my idpol obsessed company doesn't provide insurance for the first 4 months of employment.,"My company has a three month ""probationary period"" before new hires get benefits. Effectively that means four months because I started mid month, and it's taken weeks to get my insurance plan set up. I have spent the past four months using my stockpile of insulin pump supplies that I had saved up for an emergency like unemployment. Now that I finally have insurance, it has taken weeks to get the supply company to process my insurance and send me my prescriptions that I literally don't know how to live without. When I run out in four days, I will have to switch to shots, which I have not used since I was a child. I also don't have a prescription for long-acting insulin (you don't need it if you are wearing a pump), and I can't get one because I can't get into an endocrinologist in the town I moved to *until March*. If this company can't get their shit together and mail me my supplies ASAP, I have no idea what I will do.

The irony is that there is a diversity and inclusion officer *on the executive team*. The only person more powerful is the CEO. I wrote a long complaint about this issue to her, explaining that if I had not been able to save a backlog of supplies, I would have spent $5,000 on prescriptions over the last three months. This is clearly a diversity and inclusion issue since it only effects people with chronic illness or disabilities, and is a much more material issue than the normal language policing, but since it would cost the company money, they won't do anything about it. She just forwarded my complaint on to HR, who sent me an email letting me know that the three month probationary period ""is legal."" Great, that makes me feel better.

 UPDATE

Thank you everyone for your advice. I  finally got the company to process my insurance and overnight me my  supplies. It turns out they were trying to contact the wrong insurance  company.

Obviously the three month  policy isn't directly responsible for this, but it is responsible for  me almost running out of supplies because I couldn't afford them  out-of-pocket.",TurkeyFisher,t2_wf6ym,0.97,618,145

2,177hc7o,2023-10-14,MensRights,White men are actively discriminated against in the job market right now,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm a 32 year old white male in the tech industry. Specifically PM work. I was let go in the mass layoffs months ago by a major tech company that all of you probably know of. I have been in multiple interview rounds with good companies and I have never seen the market this bad for white men ever in my adult career.

Just to preface without sounding like gloating, I have a good resume with solid experience from desirable companies. I've had a number of interviews, and for the positions I want, most hiring managers/majority of panel interviewers have been women, either white or minorities. And oddly enough, every single time I reach the final stages of the interview process and I find myself interviewing with one of these women in a position of power, I get a swift rejection email.

I am cordial, well spoken and friendly. I received two offers from interviews, with the hiring managers/majority of panel members being men but unfortunately they are not companies I am very interested in.

**Two alarming trends I have noticed in tech are that being a white man is an instant negative for most companies**, especially if you find yourself in front of a panel of women or a hiring manager who is a woman. Women are also being promoted to these HM positions in much less time than their male counterparts.

**The other is underqualified women are getting these jobs that white men are competing for at increasing rates.** I checked back for the roles I was rejected for that have been filled and, unsurprisingly, all but one of them were filled by women with less experience than I have.

Just wanted to let other men (white men specifically) that are struggling know that you aren't alone. You don't meet the quotas that these companies have and you are playing against a stacked deck. This is the worst I have ever seen it, and I can only assume it will get worse. I have spoken with close friends and they are experiencing the same thing.

7,6uumes,2017-08-20,MensRights,Fuck office politics: newly arrived female coworker is in difficulty with her work and is attacking my reputation behind my back. WTF???,"The reason I post here is because many of the things this coworker does she can get away with it because she's a woman, and she's blatantly using female shaming tactics (people may not agree with the fact these are female tactics, but I think they are), *in the workplace*, to get her way...

She had a task: do her job and learn ho to do new things. Me (and others) supported her. After a few months I no longer had the obligation to support her and I realized she was slacking on purpose (facebook, amazon, chats, etc, instead of working). She... didn't like that. Because she had decided *not* to learn anything, when push came to shove and she needed to deliver, she went mad and started using the only coin at her disposal to fight the situation: social group, gossip, men-hating.

She started attacking me behind my back, trying to ruin my reputation. Her reasoning was that our boss was pressuring her to deliver, she didn't know how to do the job (spent months without applying herself) and because I was capable of doing it, *I had to drop everything for her*.

To quote her (a coworker showed me this):

- ""why doesn't Demian do it instead of me? He's the only one who knows how to do it anyway..."".
- ""I'm stuck with this, the *client* is an asshole, it's not clear what I have to do... of course it would be a lot easier if Demian supported me, but he never helps me...""
- ""this job is shit, can't do it... talk to me about your weekend :)""
- ""I asked X to give me a hand, I'm waiting for him. I watched this cool movie last night...""

Again and again, complaints in private to her friend (one of the PMs) in order to get someone to tell me to do the job *for her*. Never mentioning how she was told, when hired, that *she needed to learn this stuff*! Only implying how she's willing to do the job but my lack of support is blocking her (false and shameless accusation)...

She decided by herself that team work meant she was excempted from every responsibility. This is an example of a chat conversation:

- SHE: demian, you are not busy, right? :)
- ME: I'm busy, sorry.
- SHE: eh... you are doing research... can't you help me with this?
- ME: sorry, but I can't help you. Try to take it slowly and face one problem at a time, you'll get there.
- SHE: but I need someone to show me how it's done...
- ME: and I sent you lots of material months ago, I can't do the job for you..

She grabbed the last message and send it to four different women and a guy so they could support her in bashing me.

I had to protect myself after that. I intervened with certain coworkers and made sure my version was known. After a few days, she made so much noise and her work was so behind that my boss asked me my opinion on her and her work. 

Because of what she did (the chat convo was just one occurrence of her gossip), I sunk her in front of my boss. I spent almost 8 months without saying anything negative about a coworker (her!) in order to avoid putting her in a difficult spot, and what does she does?

She targets me because I don't go over mountains for her (where does the entitlement come from lol????) and decides to fuck with my reputation, just because she was lazy and had to choose between admitting her lack of knowledge to my bosses (damage to her image) or use social games to blame *me* instead (damage to *my* image)...

-------

Right now, I was promoted and next month I'll be in charge of her work. At the moment, she latched onto another coworker, constantly ""asking"" him how to do things, constantly ""asking"" him to look up stuff for her by saying ""she doesn't know how to do the job..."", and implying he has to because of ""team work""...

While the guy looks for stuff up, she opens her chat or facebook and starts doing random stuff or talking with her friends, waiting for him. And the spineless guy refuses to say ""no"" to her, is depressed and overloaded of work all day, and earns even less than she does...

And by the way, whenever the guy can't cope with it anymore and snaps at her, she starts gossiping behind his back telling everyone how this guy is having his ""ladies days""...

The three of us were on the same role inside the company, but unlike us, who focused on the job, she focused on her relationship with the others. At first I thought this wouldn't be an issue because we are all different, until she started using that ""support group"" she formed to backup her up on her lack of skills and all her BS...

Most men are complacent, sexless and one unemployed month away from bankruptcy. But these men are invisible to the modern woman.

No. He thinks ""I will go to work so my family can have warm meals today""

Every time I have this sort of discussion with someone I take a look around me and usually end up poiting at a working class man and this often shuts up the other person for good.

--------------

There is evidence of a growing number of men, who avoid women in the workplace, avoid being one on one, avoid mentoring women. This hurts women. 

https://nypost.com/2019/05/17/men-are-afraid-to-mentor-women-after-metoo-and-it-hurts-us-all-study/

I read a number of articles on that topic. Another example:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/pragyaagarwaleurope/2019/02/18/in-the-era-of-metoo-are-men-scared-of-mentoring-women/

There is a common pattern. Authors ignore and dismiss concerns of men, they give their own explanations of the experiences, feelings and motives of these men, in condescending and scolding manner and shift the topic to empowering women, defeating bias against women and improving career opportunities for women. So basically men should shut up, stop whining and do their best to help women advance. I'd say, it is basically womansplaining.

I know, that feminism is about women's issues, not about troubles of men. That's fair enough, I totally accept this approach. So let's assume these papers are supposed to fix the problem for women, defeat the backlash against metoo. However, let's see what kind of message does it deliver to these men, who are afraid of women at the workplace? 

Men aren't listened to. Their concerns and point of view are ignored. Men aren't entitled to be treated with dignity and feeling of security. Men are an instrument for the advance of  women... 

So if a man is afraid of women, he receives a message that his fears are completely valid.

\- no touching besides introductory handshakes

\- I NEVER comment on their looks, this applies for both positive and negative comments. I don't even do it when they are not around.

\- I never talk about dating or sex with/around them.

There, its that simple. I followed these rules since I started working and had 0 problems or complaints so far.

In my eyes the not following these rules is a risk not worth taking, especially for unattractive guys like myself.

I've heard my female coworkers calling guys creeps for merely attempting what I would judge to be ""corporate friendly"" and politically correct flirting. It only takes one willing to escalate things beyond gossip to ruin your livelihood.

My immediate boss was a pushy woman who did not understand the concept of boundaries. For example, she made telephone calls at all hours. I immediately make friends and one of the people I got very friendly with was a woman - we totally had no romantic interest in each other - and she acted more like a drinking buddy.

For some reason my boss did not like to see this friendship. For example every day, I had lunch with my female friend. But my boss warned both me and her that we were spending too much time together and I needed to spend time with people who were more knowledgeable in the work we were doing.

My boss started to call me over to her office on the pretense of explaining something or asking about progress on some project I was working on but she started flirting a lot and this involved her putting her hand on my thigh, near my crotch. Her language was also vulgar and amongst other things she made 'jokes' like asking me what size shoes I wore because according to her penis size is related to shoe size.

I sent her an email, copied in to our male, gay manager, outlining her behaviour and why I thought it was inappropriate.

I was horrified when I was fired but doubly so when she reported me to the police for lying about her and tarnishing her reputation! Incredibly the police are taking action against me.

""[Emotional labor](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/emotional-labor-in-the-workplace/202004/emotional-labor-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not) is the regulation of one’s feelings at one’s job."" Although, as acknowledged by the article linked, the meaning has been stretched to mean, ""[Women planning things.](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/)""

Both cases of ""emotional labour"" (and all other cases that include its stretched definition) have one thing in common: an abusive woman.

Picture this: You're a husband who works a job, and are trying to help around the house. Good for you, right? Except, before anything else, you'll be [berated](https://www.katykatikate.com/the-blog/2019/5/7/so-you-want-to-help-around-the-house) for not being a perfect mind-reading magician and doing so earlier. 

Then comes the fun part: Nothing you do will satisfy her. You'll be scolded and called ""incompetent"" for getting the tiniest of details wrong. You're not good enough, and you never will be. Not unless you read her mind perfectly, because she can't bother explaining things to you; she shouldn't have to.

Any confidence you had in yourself is gone, and you stop doing those things you wanted to; you always get them wrong, anyways. This is the real kicker: Now you'll be blamed for not doing enough. You're now a lazy bum, a manchild, a mama's boy. You depend on her for everything, and she can't take it, so she takes it out on you. ""I don't have to ask you to help! You should know already!"". That's the part that gets you. ""You should know already."" You should already know what she needs help doing. You should already be doing the thing. You should already know exactly how to do the thing, to the last detail. You should already know all that, and the only reason you don't is because you're not good enough.

But oh no, you're not the victim in all this; she is, because she's doing the ""emotional labour"". Stop thinking your feelings are valid; they're just a manifestation of your ""fragile male ego"" that ""needs constant appeasing"". She doesn't need to caress your ego.

in full disclosure, i'm a white male, in a creative industry that is being regulated and run by media companies with a heavy woke agenda. i've been working my way up the ladder for 15 + years now and i'm constantly seeing job offer listings with the heading ""(BIPOC) preferred."" make no mistake about it, media companies have an agenda to hire diversity. AKA, anybody but WHITE MALES.

women and people of color are being hired with no experience and being promoted up the chain overnight, something i've been working years to achieve. Further, the older white male bosses, know they're in the cross hairs and can be cancelled any minute and are terrified they are going to lose their rarified high paying job, and are as one boss told me ""making me hire"" diverse candidates, over ability, loyalty and experience.

It's not only the corporate media initiatives on the hiring side, but it's also the content - the content is all about women issues, with trans subject matter. So if you have netflix, hulu, disney, etc. you must notice that all your content is starring women and about women's issues and LBGQT subjects, etc.

Nevermind that Top Gun - an arguably patriotic, male, testosterone, action movie has done billions of dollars in GLOBAL revenue for these same companies.

You'll notice the jobs i'm speaking of are not -- plumbers, construction, electrical, truck driving, HVAC -- fields that women have no interest in, that require specialized skill and intensive labor. These are creative jobs where the only SKILL you have to have is be able to feel and relate as a woman or diverse person of color. Experience, skill be damned. The question USED TO BE ""what experience do you have?"" now the question is ""what gender and ethnicity are you?""

Further, my bosses on my last shows were ALL WOMEN (making million dollar salaries). so the notion that women are being subjugated and oppressed and dont have any mobility or opportunities, is patently false.

if i'm my own critic? hey it's social darwinism.  the times are changing, bud!  and get used to it, pal! The patriarchy is over!

but it's a tough pill to swallow. And I am angry and fed up. i'm just a guy who works his ass off and is being pushed to the back of the line because of my gender and skin color.

Women use their sexuality in work and work related settings ALL THE TIME. When they want a favor from a coworker, when they need help, when they are looking for a raise or promotion, when they are trying to get a new client/customer.

I had several dates with highly successful beautiful business women and they all laughingly admit of flirting and leading coworkers or clients/customers on in order to get that sale, promotion or just get it ""their way"". Had a date where the female CEO said if the client is a man, she sends one of her hot employees, always. And i myself -of course- over the years first hand have seen women get all girly and sexy, start using their cute girly voice when they need a favor or whatever. Its so blatant and normal, everyone knows it.

Yet women flip the fuck out when a man tries to be flirty or tries to use sexuality in their favor. They act like its an  unthinkable immoral crime that needs to be punished. If you ask women if sexuality belongs in the workplace, they all say ABSOLUTELY NOT. Yet they use it every single fucking day. Hell women told me they dress sexier for clients when they want to get a deal/sale. They flirt, they drop sexual suggestions only to later shoot the man they led on down. This all would be fine...if they weren't hypocrites that literally try to cancle and destroy men who dare to flirt back or god forbid initiate a flirt.

Coworker or customer flirts with woman at work = Oh god look at that creepy piece of shit. He should be reported and fired, this doesn't belong in the workplace.

I worked on a team with 4 other females, all counsellors/social workers/etc. On that team was a 23 year old who made her opinions about men very clear. Back in August she presented my manager with a list of things that I had said that offended her. I had no idea I was saying anything that offended her. There was about 6 things on this list, and many of them were just me expressing a different opinion than her. It was certainly never my intention to offend anyone with these opinions, and they weren't racist or sexist or derogatory. I've shown this list to many people, including many women, some of whom said they disagreed with some of my opinions, but none said they were worth complaining about. What's worse is this individual took the things I said, and twisted them, either misquoting them or taking them completely out of context, to make me look a certain way. I don't think she did this intentionally, I do believe this is what she heard me say as my words went through her filter. 

She took it to the manager, who is a female and has also demonstrated having a negative bias towards men. For this reason, I was not offered the chance to tell my side of the story; I was ignored when pointing out that I didn't say these things the way she is saying I did. I was offended, and pointed out to my manager that other people on the team, including the woman who presented this list and my manager herself, have made comments that I could have complained about should I have wanted to. My manager has also commented on my appearance more than once, which is sexual harassment, and I reminded her of this (although I didn't put it that way). I stated that I felt this was incredibly hypocritical, but it didn't matter; I was sent to anti-racism anti-oppression training, one-on-one with a trainer chosen by my manager. I showed him the list, told him my side, and he said, in his professional opinion of doing this for 20+ years, that he felt I'm being singled out and I'm being sent to this training to be ""fixed"" so I'll go back to work, shut my mouth and be quiet. He believed this was a team issue being turned into a me issue, and I agreed. This was in September. In November we met with this trainer as a team. It was uncomfortable. I expressed my fear of sharing an opinion that someone disagrees with lest it be held against me at a later time. But we did the training, and things went back to normal. My working relationship with this young woman was never the same, but it was civil. 

Flash forward 3 months, when I am sitting in my office waiting for my first client of the day, and my manager and an hr rep entered my office and told me I am being let go because I ""don't fit in"" and that my ""views are better suited elsewhere."" It was out of nowhere. I had been so careful with everything I had said since August. I received no warning, no investigation, no opportunity to fight for my job. It was decided.

I have dedicated my life to helping others. I do not discriminate against anyone, quite the opposite in fact. I help individuals of all genders, sexual orientations, races, religions, ethnicities, ages and so on. I help many people who have been discriminated against, oppressed, or stigmatized. But I was on a team with a 23 year old female who only ever saw me as a white male, and she targeted me, and she was successful. She has had an impact on me financially, on my career, and a severe impact on my mental health. I hate her, and I hate my biased manager who handled the situation different than she would have if the roles were reversed. This is a scary time.

Edit: I should have mentioned I consulted an employment lawyer. He is a friend of a friend, so I trust him and his advice. He said that although I likely have a case of discrimination, he strongly suggested I don't take legal action on the basis of discrimination, due to the fact that I am straight, white and male. He said that win or lose the case, it would reflect bad on me, particularly in the field that I work in.

The list:
-age (she was the youngest on the team by 10 years. Myself, and the rest of the team, would occasionally playfully tease her about her age. I never once put her down because of it. At a team meeting she asked all of us to stop it, and I know I did. And yet, it still made the list) -he said that questions about power and privilege on interviews are useless (in fact, I said ""I didn't see the point"" but I was referring to one specific case, but that's a whole other story. But she generalized it, and that was not my intention or meaning nor my words) - mat leave (the women on the team were having a conversation about how the US was cutting parental leave time and were talking about how sexist it is. I said I don't think it's fair to call it sexist because, although it disproportionately affects women, it affects all genders who would take parental leave) -said he wanted another male on the team; ""there are too many of you and only one of me"" (at a team meeting we were talking about hiring a new person for the team, I suggested we consider hiring another male as some clients request male counsellors specifically and because I felt it might add some more diversity to the team. I was often shut down very quickly if the women on the team did not agree with my opinion. I certainly did not say the words she put in quotation marks) -you look nice (said to her ONE TIME in the year I worked with her before she gave this list, because she got dressed up for a presentation and I was just trying to be nice. I didn't think anything of it. I certainly wasn't hitting on her or flirting with her, and again, it was a one time occurence)
-he is aggressive when his point is not agreed with and does not take into account other people's feelings (in fact, I would often be shown aggression from the females on my team. When I suggested hiring another male, the 23 year old snapped at me ""you can't say that!!"" and she clearly did not take into account my feelings. But of course that doesn't go both ways)",Jzurb,t2_vip53,0.95,3039,500

######Credit: u/FelineQuinine

Notice how 93% of workplace fatalities are still men.  A fact that men apparently do not get compensated for.

~~The math is pretty simple, though not obvious at first:~~

~~$1 / ($1 + $0.77) = 0.56~~

I think this shows pretty clearly what the largest factor in the earnings gap is.

Of course the fact that men have to work longer hours than women is itself a problem. Paying for dates and bills for your girlfriend / wife isn't exactly cheap. Not to mention that many women look for men who earn more money, thus creating an incentive for men to sacrifice their work-life balance in order to earn more.

I guarantee most men would love to work fewer hours and spend more time at home but the spending and earning patterns of their partners don't often facilitate this.

This also contributes to poorer health outcomes for men and the fact that men die 5 years earlier than women on average.

**Edit:** Graph is fine, title is misleading.  The 77 cents per dollar thing is likely just a colloquialism at this point.  The graph itself is showing total hours worked for all workers, part time and full time combined.

I’m not joining the club. 

I can’t take you seriously if the word entitlement isn’t paired with responsibility. Start explaining what you are responsible for. 

I don’t care if you wear a bra. Why is this still a thing ? Do what you want. 

I don’t need to hear anything related to your reproductive cycle, we are not a couple so why do you feel like sharing publicly. Sharing is not caring. Your body is your business. 

If you take the time to creat list and be thoughtful do it silently. Telling others about the emotional labor you endured takes away from any generosity you supposedly offered. 

If women are still too sexualized it’s because too many of your sisters are looking for  a short cut. Deal with them, not me. 

If a man shares a thoughts or a feeling let him finish it. Talking isn’t a competitive sport. Emotions are real and not icons in your chat app. Let a man express himself  once in a while. And listen once in a while. 

And lastly, if men are so bad why do you glom onto them as if they are owed to you. No man owes you anything, least of all a relationship if he isn’t ready for one. Or if you are not the one.

134,n0jarm,2021-04-28,MensRights,All female management and HR forced me out of the company after reporting harassment,"This happened three years ago at a small company and it still has been weighing on me. It was one of those ""we're one big family"" tech companies who prided itself on having beer in the fridge and a ""great culture"". 

The management structure above me was my lead (female), mid level manager (female), direct manager (female), and department head (male). The HR department was 3 people (all female). For what it's worth, I am also an ethnic minority and all the women in management were white women. 

Myself, a female colleague, and another male colleague were all up for a promotion. The only one that walked away with a promotion was my female colleague, despite myself and my male colleague being there far longer (I actually interviewed and made the call to hire the person who was promoted). The company had a formal list of criteria needed for a promotion, so I created a list with evidence for every bullet point and sent it to my manager. She refused to even glance at it and told me my accomplishments were not relevant. Weeks later I pleaded with her to go over this document and discuss my career goals. She flipped out on me, called me all kinds of names, and then stormed off. 

I went to the head of the department and explained what had happened. He was shocked at the behavior and had no idea what was going on in the department. He scheduled a meeting with the three of us and she tried to lay into me again, but instead her boss chewed her out for unprofessional behavior. He then saw my list of accomplishments and decided I was definitely in line for a promotion and I was promoted not long after, along with my male colleague. I thought it was over. Boy was I wrong.

A few months later the department head left the company and was replaced by a female department head (so the entire management structure was female). My boss held a grudge and it was open season on me now. But this time she stepped over the line and harassed me over email with direct language about a disability I have. This is blatantly illegal so I went to HR. 

They immediately defended her and tried to gaslight me. Everything I said they tried to counter, until I presented them with the harassment in writing. I stood firm and knew my rights and they backed down. What transpired after that was 6 months of retaliation (I spoke to a lawyer and he said there's not much you can do until they fire you). 

Constant belittling, talking bad about me to other coworkers, turning people against me. Every 1 on 1 meeting we had was recorded (something she never did to anyone else). Every time I pushed this up the all female chain of command it fell on deaf ears. Eventually I left the company, just like they wanted. My position was filled by my boss's female friend. I am told by someone that still works there she had been badmouthing me behind my back for over 2 years.

Keep in mind this is a company where other female employees openly said they discriminated against men. They host and sponsor feminist events. They openly say their pride themselves on hiring women. 

When I reported my manager for harassment, it was me against a clique that openly made it clear where they stand, and that stance was firmly against men.

I know my experience is nothing compared to the literal horror stories that have been posted here but I just felt I needed to get this whole thing off my chest.

So I started thinking about opening an anti-feminism online store some time ago. I hate all these feminist slogan T-shirts that are everywhere nowadays. I wasn't familiar with the screen printing process but I figured I'd use the service of companies which handle that for you. And so I went for it. Boy, I was in for a treat.

After I'd created the shirt designs, I started looking for a screen printing company. I didn't expect there to be so many options to choose from, so I spent some time researching. There were two or three companies that kind of dominated the industry but they charged more than the rest just because they had more bells and whistles. 

This put me off as I couldn't afford to pay for unnecessary stuff. My first choice was a smaller company that I hoped would offer more of a personalized service. So I created my account, uploaded my designs and continued the work on my online store. However, the next day I was notified my designs were apparently in violation of this site's rules and qualified as offensive. I re-read their policy and while I did not agree that my designs [(here's a few examples)](http://imgur.com/a/mRjzb#1) were in any way abusive or offensive, I decided to let it go and use another service. I figured any arguments at that point would be meaningless.

Now here's where the real fun starts. After going through the entire process again - filling out forms, uploading designs etc. - I received a termination email of sorts from the second company too! This time it wasn't even some pre-written template. It was sent to me directly by the owner of the service, basically telling me to go to hell because of my 'ridiculous' views.

A proud 'fefminist'? She must've been so mad that she started mistyping words and stuff, lmao. Acting all outraged by the fact that people are selling men's rights apparel. Because that's reserved for poor oppressed feminists only, right? But who's the oppressed one really? Again, my designs were in no way abusive!

Her condescending tone admittedly pissed me off, though the fact that she came off as an illiterate moron kind of amused me at the same time. It was frustrating mostly because I had to start all over several times but I tried not to get worked up about it and now I'm close to finishing my project with another company.

Everything I thought about feminism was true. It isn't about gender equality at all.

For the record, I have not mentioned any company names because I realize how passionate this community is. I don't want to feel guilty in case any companies/websites receive some sort of backlash due to my comments. Sure, I think they might deserve it to a certain extent but I also don't wish to affect their source of income even if their handling of the situation was questionable.

EDIT: To the guys who think I should post the companies' names: I appreciate your opinion, but it's not happening for the following reasons:

1) I DID submit personal details to both services. Some people have already called me a coward but I've had personal dealings with raving feminists before and I do not wish to go through all the bullshit again. Especially online. I don't have the time and I don't need the drama. If you feel I'm letting you down, sorry.

2) Whatever I've shared here, they will simply deny, so what's the point? It's their word against mine, except that it's also their company.

3) The companies are small enough that I can almost guarantee you won't be unfortunate enough to stumble upon their services unless you were very, very specific. If you're looking to get an online tee business going, don't make the mistakes I made and just go to a major company.

As far as the shirts go: as I mentioned in the original post, I'd considered working with one of the big screen printing companies to finish my store but after reading through the comments and doing some additional research, I'm going with an on demand fulfillment service. It's more convenient and I hope it won't take too long because I'm going on vacation soon. But more importantly, the process is completely automated so I won't have to deal with any more morons online. It costs more but I probably won't make much money either way, so fuck it. This way at least I'm saving some time.",crop-me-out,t2_nv6lw,0.95,784,281

Women complains that man keeping it professional at work makes her and other female coworkers feel uncomfortable","The other day I was bored and started doomscrolling on Reddit when I found this post on r/relationship_advice 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/10yx39j/a\_colleague\_at\_work\_27m\_of\_1\_year\_refuses\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10yx39j/a_colleague_at_work_27m_of_1_year_refuses_to/)

Essentially the post is about how some dude in the office (27M) won’t speak to OP (24F) and the other women at the office. He won’t talk with them about anything other than work with the girls, but is friends with the guys. However, he is cordial and will exchange some basic pleasantries (have a good day etc). In other words, he is being a normal coworker and OP doesn’t like that.

Now here’s the twist. OP said that one of the girls is considering go to HR about this because she is saying its creating a hostile work environment. This is the part that really pissed me off. Now I acknowledge that maybe the majority of women aren't like this, don't generalize blah blah blah I get it. However, it's not that every woman will, but that any woman can. This is the exact same situation as the google manager in a thread that got posted a while back where the guy got fired for not responding to a female coworker's advances. So the idea that this is an impossible scenario is simply false.

There is simply no winning anymore. Now if you follow the Pence rule, you can be punished for that to.   Act friendly with a woman and ask her out or show interest, and you get punished or fired for harassment. Okay. Men adapt. Now, you act professional with a woman, and her and her friends get upset that this is a hostile work environment and want to report this to HR. If a man does A he gets in trouble. If he does B he gets in trouble. If he reverses course and does Z or Y he gets in trouble as well. If he says f the system it's all BS and goes MGTOW, then he gets labelled incel, misogynist, sexist.

It is promising however that pretty much everyone in the thread called OP out for her total BS, but the simple fact that a group of women would even think to do this is just insane. I suspect (this is just my opinion) that the man is attractive, she showed interest, he says no thanks let's talk about work, and she takes it personally and builds a *hostile work environment* in her mind because she can't fathom that someone doesn't want to be best buddies with her *at work* and just wants to be professional. More attention-seeking bullshit. Nobody is entitled to friendship to anyone, but somehow this is too much to comprehend for some people. Imagine being so fragile that someone not being your best friend makes you feel uncomfortable. It honestly seems to me that she and the other girls at the office are harassing him. Rules for thee but not for me. I shoot you for no reason, but I am the victim.

Imagine if a group of guys went to HR and said, ""we feel upset that a female coworker at the office won't talk with us"". They would be annihilated. This is just complete delusion.

They should be either paid more than females, or require the same physical standards.","Doesn't the slogan ""Equal pay for equal work"" apply here?

If everyone is to be paid the same, tests should be gender neutral. This would also account for genders other than male or female that people would like to be identified.

Physical fitness test should be cater to the job, not the gender. Military is a profession, not a welfare program.

This webpage, although a little outdated, gives a brief outline of the scoring standards for fitness tests of all US military services. ([https://mybaseguide.com/military-fitness-tests/](https://mybaseguide.com/military-fitness-tests/))

The one for the Army is a little outdated. The former test, APFT, was gender discriminatory. The new test, ACFT was initially supposed to be gender neutral. Then they changed it to where the scoring would be gender neutral, but females would get more promotion points for the same score. Then they changed one component of the test, from the leg tuck to the plank, and also made the scoring gender discriminatory. The most recent scoring for the test is ([https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/acft/ACFT\_scoring\_scales\_220323.pdf](https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/acft/ACFT_scoring_scales_220323.pdf)) .

I also hold the view that physical tests should also be AGE neutral. In the case of jobs or ranks that don't require high physical standards, make the physical tests less demanding ( a General doesn't need the same physical fitness as an infantryman/infantrywoman/infantryperson ).

FYI, the intelligence test for the US military is called the ASVAB, and is gender neutral.

For the argument that females bring skills other than physical fitness, if any such skill is important, it should be measured in a gender neutral way.

In case they need females for a specific task, a temporary limited exemption may be made (example: Cultural Support Teams that were useful in Muslim countries).  But a service wide exemption is unfair.

For the argument that females are generally less stronger that males and that should be accounted for: There is no reason to give special exceptions to any category. Why don't we categorize by height then? Why not by eye color, or hair color? What about gender makes it necessary to categorize by that? Also, combat is gender neutral.",jacare_o,t2_14fj8j,0.85,1960,307

Here's the interesting point she brings up.  She works in a primarily male dominated profession, law enforcement.  She's an investigator for the state police in the state we live in, and she's damn good at her job too.  One time while discussing the idea of feminism, she told me this.  

>I work in a very male dominated job, and so do a few of my female co-workers.  I've discussed this idea with them, and none of them are advocates of women's rights like you read on the internet, or hear about radical feminists.  The problem with the women's rights movement is this, most of those radical feminists, are in jobs where they don't really have to deal with real life.  They're in professions like college professors, secretaries, stupid shit like that. 

>A lot of people say that business is a man's world, but where I work, it's truly a man's world.  I could count the amount of women who work where I work on one hand.  A lot of these feminists don't live or work in a man's world.  If they were to, they would see that the men don't treat them any differently than they treat each other.  There's no special rules for harassment, because we all harass each other, we all play jokes on each other, we all call each other names, it happens.  The feminists live in a world where they create this pseudo-oppression for themselves, and blame it on men.  Subsequently they feel the need to try and take rights away from men.  Equality for women is already here.  Feminists don't want equality, they want power.

&#x200B;

This LinkedIn study from 2019 used their internal data to examine differences between men and women when job searching. Among the key findings are the fact that men and women view a similar number of jobs though women apply to 20% fewer. A recruiter is 13% more likely to view a man's profile which she described as result of a problematic bias that must be corrected (even though they also found that recruiters will still contact both genders at equal rates).

However, the author (Maria Ignatova) makes no effort to hide her own bias (and sexism) by writing:

>The good news is that when women do apply to a job, they are 16% more likely than men to get hired. In fact, if the role is more senior than their current position, that number goes up to 18%.  
>  
>While this is an uplifting stat, it does show that women do a very thorough job at vetting roles — sometimes maybe too thorough. If women only apply when they feel extremely qualified, this could also indicate they are not pursuing stretch opportunities.

Linkedin is a mainstream website, not a fringe feminist blog. Yet blatant discrimination in hiring practices is celebrated as ""good news"" and as ""uplifting stat(s)"". This doesn't lead to equality, it's just another piece of evidence that equality isn't the actual goal.

Her analysis is also very weak and uses the usual strategy of reframing all issues so that women are the real victims. I think a more plausible hypothesis for why men apply to 20% more jobs is because if we are getting rejected more often then we need to submit more applications to increase our chances of finding work. Of course I would submit fewer if I was getting offers at 16-18% higher rate.

For most of us, this is just seeing statistics that support what we already knew is happening. The worst part is just being gaslit, and told this is ""equality"" and if we have a problem with it we are misogynist or examples of ""toxic masculinity"".

I live on the property of a private boat club, the property is gated, fenced, and has no trespassing signs all over. I live here to keep non-members out of the property as we are located on the water in a large park. 

Tonight I come home from work and do my walk around the property, as I do everyday, and I came across to young women sunbathing on one of the docks. I asked if they were members, they said no, and asked the to politely leave because this is private property. That's when they started to call me a perv, they can do what thay want, on and on. I am a very level headed person and let them rant and I calmly assed them to leave. They called 911 and screaming that some creepy old perv was harassing them. 

After a few minutes the police show up. Two female police. One goes and talks to the girls, the other talks to me. I explain to here that I live here and it is my job as caretaker to keep people from trespassing on the property. All the while the girls are getting all emotional with the other officer using words like creepy, they felt threatened, rape, the whole 9 yards. The 2 officers talk alone, then come over and cuff me risk me, take my wallet, phone, and keys, then seat me in the back of my car while they check my background and a warren search. All the while the two sunbathing girls are all giddy about me being in cuffs and taking my pic and text/posting like crazy. 

After about 15 minutes they take me out of the car and cuffs, and tell me I am free to go. (Go where? I fucking live here!) They then ask the girls, who are pissed that I was uncuffed, if they wanted to file a report against me, but they would have to leave the property. 

So for doing my job, on private property where I live, I end up in handcuffs for being considered ""creepy"" by doing my job. 

The officers never asked me if I wanted to file charges against them for trespassing.....of course. 

Update #1: I woke up this morning and my just venting on here blew up. I've replied to a few comments. I spoke to the board members of the club and we agree that in the future I should just call the non emergency number for the police and to record it. I also contacted a member who is a retired from the state supreme court and she told me ""that is utter bullshit"" as to how I was detained and she is putting a call into the police chief. I appreciate all the support, thank you!

Update #2: I recieved a phone call from the police departments internal affairs division today, they took a statement from me and are going to look into how the officers handled the call. I should hear something in a few weeks. I got the names of of the two girls who were tresspassing. So far I have not found any pics of me cuffed in the back of the car. 
  

Update #3, It has been over a month since I filed my complaint over be handcuffed, detained, questioned, and background checked. So this afternoon was low at work and I called the CPD internal affairs division to find out the status of my complaint against the officers. Well over 45 minutes being put on, on and off hold, I was told that there is no record of the report. I have the report number and they can't seem to find it.

is a very proud feminist. I am the only male in the class. This is a small college so she is teaching the entire program. The man bashing was getting out of hand and I had enough. So I wrote her this email regarding some of my issues in the class:

Hello R\*\*\*,

I am not happy in your classes. I feel that it is the duty of the instructor to present the material as unbiased as possible, and as a proud feminist you do not do that. These issues are not new, I have been feeling this way for a long time. However, it was on Wednesday of last week that I reached my breaking point. In my twenties I may have identified as a feminist, but I’ve grown since. I do not support the feminist ideology. I believe in equal rights, but “woke feminism” is a joke at best, and very dangerous at its worst. I realize that you are very passionate about your feminist beliefs, but I am not, and I do not want to hear it in the classroom any longer. I have requested several times to transfer to another class however B\*\*\*\*\*n is not responding to my emails. I can no longer sit quietly on this. Until they can find another class for me to join, I will be joining your lectures, but I will do minimal participation. I will not answer questions, and my camera will be off. Topics such as mansplaining, manspreading and the pay gap are non-issues. Mansplaining is a feminist tactic to silence men, manspreading is due to biology, the pay gap is due to the difference choices that men and women make. To pay someone differently for the same job with the same qualifications is illegal and every time they look for it in the West, they repeatedly find men as the underpaid gender, if it exists at all. Just look at what happened with women’s soccer in the US and the BBC in the UK. There is no Patriarchy, just a hierarchy based upon competence, with the most competent rising to the top. And that is just the tip of the iceberg.

Feminism is an ideology based upon victimhood and I will not be a part of that belief system.

It is because I like and respect you that I am writing this email. If it was not for that, I would not have returned.

One last point, men make up 95% of war casualties. The ones that do survive are traumatized, disfigured and never the same. To say that women and children are the biggest victims of war, was deeply offensive. If one considers all people as equals and you can still regard women and children as the biggest victims of war, something is very wrong with your reasoning. Most of those men that died; died protecting our borders so we can be safe and enjoy our lives in peace. Do not discredit their sacrifices. None of them wanted to die, but that was the cost of our freedom.

Sincerely,

Update:

My professor's reply was sent through Bongo. Our classes are all online. I didn't realize that Bongo does not automatically save private messages. The gist of her reply was that she apologized for making me feel uncomfortable in class and she wants to talk with me face to face about my issues with the class. I actually have a good relationship with the professor. I do have the support of all the students in the classroom. The day of the incident where she was particularly man bashing I commented that there was ""too much man hating going on"". The rest of the class either apologized or came to my defense. I really like my classmates. I then went completely silent for the rest of the week and did not join her class. 

In class I've been referred to as ""one of the good ones"" which I find particularly patronizing. I actually do like my professor and we do have some good debates. I am the only one to challenge her opinions in class and she respects that.
I'm not worried about her retaliating, there have been so many complaints about her and she is constantly flirting with myself and others. Everything is recorded.

212,tcyo1p,2022-03-13,MensRights,"Australian report by feminist organisation claims support for men's rights is a ""significant barrier to gender equality""","This report summarises a survey of Australians with regards to attitudes towards gender equality and was conducted by a feminist organisation which is, as they all are, solely focused on things like getting more female CEOs and more women elected to political office.

There is some good news in the report and the feminists must have burned in anger at having to write it. For example:

>**Men have been forgotten in the struggle for gender equality**  
>  
>Our survey reveals a worrying statistic in this regard: nearly half of all male respondents “agreed or strongly agreed” with the statement that “gender equality strategies in the workplace do not take men into account”. If we disaggregate the data by generation, we find that while millennial and builder males were most likely to report feelings of being left out, all generations exhibited similar sentiments. Millennial males were also significantly more likely (48 per cent) to “agree/strongly agree” with the statement that “Men and boys are increasingly excluded from measures to improve gender equality”, followed by Gen Z males at 44 per cent. Gender equality measures are not the only interventions that are perceived by men to deepen, rather than fix existing inequalities. The highly contested concept of freedom of speech also reveals significant gendered differences, with men far more likely to say that political correctness benefits women in the workplace.

This section is surprisingly revealing of feminist motivations. I'm surprised they would include this in a public report:

>**Male moderates are champions of men’s rights**  
>  
>The moderate perspective combines an egalitarian set of views around gender equality in the workplace and at home with rising concern over what they understand as the growing impact of political correctness in Australian society, as well as a strong desire to see men’s rights equally represented in public discussion of equality issues. Given that 62 per cent of Australians align with the moderate position and its value system, this represents a significant barrier to gender equality.

Got that?

Feminists think that concerns for men's rights and a desire to see men treated equally to women are an obstacle to feminists achieving the goals that they dishonestly label ""equality"".

Other stats cited include:

* 41% of Australian men believe that political correctness gives women an advantage in the workplace
* 46% of Australian men believe that gender equality measures do not take men into account
* 42% of Australian men believe that men and boys are increasingly excluded from measures to improve gender equality

The feminist authors fear that these popular and growing attitudes could result in a ""backlash"" against feminist initiatives and ""backsliding"" away from the goals which they're pursuing.

Of course, any time that feminists are unhappy or even hysterical it is good news for men and for progress towards true equality. I see this report as quite positive.

228,110i701,2023-02-12,stupidpol,Why the internet's learn-to-code obsession is baseless,"I understand this is a bit niche, but if you spend enough time around the internet, particularly reddit, you'll find loads of people claiming to work in the information technology/software/computers space, either as developers or ancillary occupations. If you fall into the right mainstream circles, such as career advice forums, they're completely inundated with an obsession for information technology, finance, blue collar trades, and a smattering of other careers. Anecdotally, it seems the job market in western society is becoming increasingly concentrated.

This career advice pushing youth towards tech is frequently accompanied by unsubstantiated claims of a ""shortage"" of human capital within the tech sector (despite admitting that there is also a large amount of job rationing, which is obvious cognitive dissonance). They cite examples of many mega-cap companies being borne from the tech sector, and that digitization is increasing, therefore developers will always be well-paid and in demand, i.e. it's a good career choice. 

Before I continue, please let me make three things clear:

1. General purpose computing/technology is incredibly powerful, and yes, there are large macroeconomic forces driving its continued adoption in all sorts of industries,

2. I do believe that information technology has brought many benefits to humanities and, for all its ills, has also alleviated a degree of human suffering, and

3. If you need to learn a trade, learning to make software is a decent choice. It is also accessible and personally rewarding.

That said, I recently listened to [this podcast episode,](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3NTusQGtqIE1Sop2EoJd9F?si=0cca9c5ffe564e4f) (Revolutions 10.3 - The Three Pillars of Marxism) in which Mike Duncan (the host) discusses, among other things, the division of labor, and how it serves to alienate workers from the products of labor, and recognize their value as human capital.

Oddly, the first chapter of [The Wealth of Nations](https://youtu.be/7pFD7xcKb1U) by Adam Smith also talks extensively about the benefits of the division of labor, by allowing for workers specification and comparative advantage. Everyone agrees that the division of labor can increase productivity and pushes down labor costs.

Anyways, to tie this all together:

Reddit's learn-to-code fetishism is already outdated, if it ever applied at all. I've worked in the tech industry for some time now and the division of labor has reached a point where most software developers, in addition to being at the base of the power structure of these companies, the bitch boys that do most of the work while a handful of MBAs make all the money, are effectively alienated from the products they produce. While it can be done (example: PUBG), it is increasingly difficult for small or one man dev teams to consistently compete with major industry players. **The software industry, while still relatively well-paid for the time being, is set on a course to become the factory floor of the 21st century.** More concerningly, software is setting trends for a highly fractured, insecure employment market moving forward. **White collar workers, who were previously able to rideout economic meltdowns in developed economies, like the US in the 1980s, will find themselves pushed into the labor class from the PMC class.** Pumping the brakes on the learn-to-code train, or at least creating class consciousness in this PMC->prole class, would be extremely beneficial to developed economies.

> The traditional and vulgarized type of the intellectual is given by the Man of Letters, the philosopher, and the artist. Therefore, journalists, who claim to be men of letters, philosophers, artists, also regard themselves as the ""true"" intellectuals. In the modern world, technical education, closely bound to industrial labour, even at the most primitive and unqualified level, must form the basis of the new type of intellectual. . . . The mode of being of the new intellectual can no longer consist of eloquence, which is an exterior and momentary mover of feelings and passions, but in active participation in practical life, as constructor [and] organizer, as ""permanent persuader"", not just simple orator.

Both at woke companies.,"I graduated last spring, got a stem degree because “tHaTs wHeRe tHe fUtUrE iS”, relocated to a city seven hours away and then got laid off with over 500 others only four months later because they decided all our departments were too expensive and they could hire the same number of visa workers for a third less. The same day they posted about how excited they were that “the majority of our leadership positions are now held by women” on all their accounts.

Fast forward to now, I managed to get another job, still with a Fortune 500 unfortunately, had to relocate a second time. It’s a large industrial company, yesterday on a quarterly earnings call the CFO explains leadership is happy Biden won because, and I quote “now that Trumps tariffs are gone we can start moving some of the more expensive production we have here to our more economical regions, and with restrictions on visas now gone we can bring in much more (cheap) talent”. Visas regularly impact my field first and my manager said don’t be surprised if layoffs of domestic workers take place. But while the CFO giddily talks about outsourcing thousands of jobs and bringing in immigrant workers to fill the ones they can’t, every social media page was bragging about how the executive leadership is now minorities and the new chief counsel is a black woman.

I apologize for the long rant, but I am so exhausted by the corporate class fucking over American workers, normally forming actually real diverse teams of background, education, religion, etc, and just shipping in homogenous groups of workers because then they can give middle management extra bonuses.

246,u4gnwj,2022-04-15,stupidpol,Idpol in the service industry,"I've been lurking here for a while and thought you guys might like to hear about something that happened to me recently. If you want, please share your own stories about how you've seen idpol used as an excuse to treat service workers like shit.

I'm 26 and have been working in restaurants since I was 18. If you've worked service, you know that shit customers transcend all politics and identity markers. It is a myth that white women are the only Karens. A black lady with an IN THIS HOUSE, WE BELIEVE sign is just as likely to ruin your night as a guy who looks like he owns 3 giant trucks.

I worked at a self consciously liberal restaurant that prides itself on giving us a living wage. It is not a socialist utopia but it's much better than most places and we get about 20-30 applications for every job we post.

Part of the restaurant's vibe is that we don't use Uber Eats or Door Dash or any of that shit because they treat their employees like shit. But since we're not web developers that means that if a customer wants to make a carryout order or place reservations they have to actually pick up a phone and call us.

We were very busy last weekend, like we normally are. Two younger women (maybe 22-23) come in and ask for a table. I tell them we might be able to get them seated at the bar. They say they can't do that because it's too crowded. I'm thinking ""well this whole place is crowded,"" but whatever, I said it would be 30-45 minutes before they got a table. They looked pissed off, but that's normal when people are told they have to wait. They took a seat.

Maybe ten minutes later another couple comes in. They had a reservation and so I took them to their table right away. When I get back to the host stand, one of the girls who was waiting was sobbing. Not crying, but visibly heaving and shaking like she just found out someone had died. 

I'm not a monster so I went over and asked what was wrong and if we could help. That's when I noticed the other girl was filming me with her phone. Normally we tell people to stop right away but I basically froze. 

Then the other girl started screaming so loud the entire place got quiet. She said I had discriminated against them. She said I the restaurant was biphobic. I was panicking because this is the best job I've ever had and I had no idea what she was talking about. I said something like ""How would I know you're bi?"" 

I don't remember exactly what she said but she was mad that I had seated the ""cis couple"" before them. I explained that they had reservations and, now that I knew what going on was bullshit, I got a little mad and told them that if they wanted to get seated right away they should have made reservations. She said she tried but our ""shitty ass website"" (which is an accurate description) didn't let her. I explained how you have to call, and she said she can't call strangers because of her anxiety and that along with being biphobic we were also ableist.

By this point the manager came out and angrily told them to get the fuck out. He's a big dude and they didn't fight him. But they did send the video to the owner the next day demanding to know my name and all of my social media and told him they'd never come back if I wasn't fired. He told them to fuck off, and so far I haven't seen the video on social media so thank god for that.",charmingyoungman05,t2_jbxais75,0.98,520,130
249,za63z4,2022-12-02,stupidpol,"The Railroad Strike would present a critical juncture in the history of the nation -- let alone labor -- if they go ahead and do it illegally, and they should.","I wouldn't blame the workers if they don't do this or just decide to resign en masse (there are already unprecedented resignations in the industry). People have families. The security state is far more advanced than it ever was in the later 19th/early 20th century. They *will* attack.

Yet, there is simply no avoiding the fact that illegal strikes and a lot of dirty play (let's say, for example, rail workers sabotage lines) are necessary. Power isn't going to just give up anything, not a single thing. It is naive in the extreme to think otherwise, such as to be historically illiterate.

They'd likely need even broader public support, however, and the support of many other unions as well. Breaking the picket line needs to be a serious offense shamed and punished in the way same way it once was over 100 years ago.

I try to discuss this with middle-class liberals I know, the same types who King would have written about in jail. While they profess to care for the poor and support labor, the fact is that you can't both support rail workers and support Democrats.

Democrats don't ever get anything done not because they're blocked, but because they don't want to and are generally openly anti-labor. If the only time you promote policies that would help working-class people (such as this or the failed student loan forgiveness) is when it's very predictable it will fail rather than when you have the power or opportunity, you're gaslighting voters.

To continue supporting or defending Biden when he is attacking workers like this is to self-identify as an elitist with no love or care for the poor. These are the same liberals who continue to speak of Reagan's evils from decades ago; Biden here is mimicking Reagan's treatment of the air traffic control strikers, a monumental moment in modern American political history that left us all poorer.

'Demonstrate a baseline consistency in values,' I'll suggest to them, but since Biden has been elected, liberals haven't seemed to have the courage to so much as attempt a feeble answer to the abuses of their sports team. That Biden is a cruel, petty corporate sycophant was obvious throughout his political history, yet people who ostensibly care about the poor continue to offer their support even as he and the party continue to viciously hurt families.

It has to be illegal. It has to come at a cost. There is just no other way anymore. Labor needs to get its balls back, and we collectively have to unplug from what Terrance McKenna once called 'shit-brained thinking' generated by an electronic \[corporate\] media that today has become so ubiquitous as to see people marching themselves into the slaughter house:

*""We have to stop consuming our culture. We have to create culture. Don't watch TV. Don't read magazines. Don't even listen to NPR. Create your own roadshow.""*

Labor has to 'create its own roadshow' or this country is simply doomed. Part of that will have to include unplugging from liberal media, liberal credetialism, liberal essentialism, moralism, and 'values,' grabbing at the power labor has with little to no regard for the 'laws' written by a class of businessmen and lawyers who can only be described as genocidal (note that by 'liberal,' I include 'neoliberalism' in my meaning, which in my view encompasses most of the country's 'conservative' and centrist politics).

I know that for many members of this sub, this is preaching to the choir. Basic materialist analysis. But historical moments like this impress upon us all the urgency of action in the face of unconscionable evil.

I agree that the barriers are absolutely tremendous, that we are dealing with a new kind of digital oppression, but since the alternative is increasing death and destitution, there is no choice but to try and find a way.

During the course of a single hour, various speakers and audience members made the following claims, all of which were met with uniform affirmation:

* All surgeries and medical procedures trace their roots to anti-black eugenics
* Doctors are trained to believe that black people are a different species
* There exists a nation-wide network of white kidnappers who abduct ""hundreds of thousands"" of black American children each year
* Before colonization ""all of Africa"" shared a single, unified culture and there were no wars
* Before colonization, Africans had no understanding of personal property or forms of currency (ironically, this line used to be popular with Stormfront posters and apartheid apologists)

I don't know exactly when it was determined that terms like ""prostitute,"" ""stripper,"" ""camgirl,"" ""porn star"" were demeaning to their subjects and must be replaced by the catch-all euphemism ""sex worker,"" but a consequence of the shift has been the distortion of any conversation involving any or all of those jobs. Person A could say something like ""sex work is inherently harmful, etc."" and be speaking with prostitution and hardcore pornography in mind; Person B could reply ""well my friend is a sex worker and she's doing very well for herself"" and be talking about someone who pole dances or gets naked on camera.  It seems to me there's a difference in kind between, say, receiving a one-time payment from a stranger in exchange for penetrative sex and receiving payment from cloud-mediated strangers in exchange for nude photos of oneself (a similar distinction exists between ""impoverished runaway under the thumb of organized crime"" and ""adventurous grad student in NYC who gets to pick and choose""), but it's hard to have a nuanced discussion about any of it when it's all made fungible under the ""sex worker"" classification.

I mean this in regard to representation on a statistical basis. Obviously diffferent products have different target demographics. This is not what I am referencing. 

I think that it should be a non-controversial observation to point out that this is no longer reality and has not been for a time. There is an over representation of just about everything. I won’t get into the “why” behind this as it isn’t germane to this particular discussion.   

I have said all this to say that I just watched a commercial that revolved around Christmas dinner and  have finally reached the point of incredulity. In a nuclear family + spouses (young children strangely missing) we had the following eating dinner together at the table: 

Dad: typical balding overweight tv dad (tm)
Mom: beautiful Hispanic woman 
The other six family members were white woman, black man, white man, Asian woman, middle eastern man. One obviously homosexual couple and who knows about the rest. 

These were not friends or office mates. The ad made it clear that this was a family on two occasions. 

The question(s) I have is/are:  

- Does anyone in the real world believe that this family exists (out of super outlier multi-racial adopters of purposely multi-racial orphans?  

- Is this the level of pandering that national brands believe they must engage in to avoid reprisals?

- Are we nearing a tipping point on this sort of thing? Is the projection of this level of statistically skewed nonsense beginning rub up against our indwelt perception?

- Can it get any more ridiculous? If so how?",trufus_for_youfus,t2_fyesd,0.96,314,165
282,qeagoc,2021-10-23,stupidpol,"Statement from Ryan Carr who worked on Rust before shooting about cost-cutting, union busting and other practices leading to death of Halyna Hutchins","This is a public post on his FB. He seems to be a long standing stuntman and uses the social media handle @theninjaclub. I should clarify that I think he worked for the production company on a previous project, so it's not completely clear how much of the following statement is referring to his experiences with the previous project, and how much with Rust.

""
For those of you industry and non industry friends following this story. I unfortunately have some first hand insight. :(


My thoughts are regret that I didn't say something earlier when I worked for this production company -Thomasville Pictures- in Feburary as a Thomasville Local. When I and multiple department heads including the prop master expressed shock for safety issues and poor planning concerning the very basics of set safety and common sense to multiple producers and were dismissed or just outright taken off the department head meeting schedule (no pay) or off the days shoot entirely.


1. This was totally avoidable. There are safety protocols in place, which is why this tragedy is so rare. Non industry but Thomasville friends... think Union Job.


2. I worked for this production company #ThomasvillePictures as a SAG Aftra stunt coordinator this year. I raised safety concerns during my employment. That was my job. I was not asked to be a part of their future projects. I had to educate producers on blanks, Class C explosives licence for SPFX department head, and numerous other concerns from car hits to any other type of crap you could think of. They had no idea what they were doing. I wouldn't let them around a horse none the less a gun. They dont know how to make the movies they are making.

3. This was a real gun and real bullet on set. Unforgivable.


4. The gun was taken for target practice by the propmasters daughter before filming. Ridiculous.


5. The gun was not checked on set. Insane.


6. The producers hired non union crew to film that day when their crew walked out for safety concerns the day before. That's when filming should have stopped.


7. There is a difference between a prop master and an armorer for a reason. They know better. Because I told them in Feburary.


8. The producers are responsible and ultimately negligent for hiring non union workers and not checking their work. Manslaughter.


9. Alec Baldwin is a union actor and a producer on the film Rust. Hes one of the bosses.


10. Thomasville Pictures is an unsafe production company. They cut corners and didnt hire union professionals. Thomasville let's them do everything for free. They got someone killed and should never be allowed to make movies again.


11. The prop master of the film One Way walked off of set for safety concers. Just like this movie. Foreshadowing 
How many people need to walk off a movie set or say they feel unsafe before a producer will listen?


Send your thoughts and prayers to the families of Halyna Hutchins and Joel Souza not the producers of this film. It's not an accident. Its negligence. They dont know what they are doing. Everyone should claim responsibility for their incompetence instead of filming a western when they dont even know basic set or weapon safety. The best outcome is that these producers aren't allowed to make anymore movies and send every $ they saved being cheap to the child of Halyna Hutchins.""",Leandover,t2_bdsc9,0.99,211,111

Especially on social media, reddit including, you can go to any left wing socialist spaces and find little to no information regarding policy proposals, current events (outside of outrage mongering), or discussion of theory. It's all progressive activism and reactionary tantrums with zero substance. I just fail to see the connecting line between an industry co-opted by capitalist billionaires around a community of historically disenfranchised people now sitting in a position of highest privilege culturally is at all relevant to left wing ideology, or in any way conducive to the betterment of people's lives.

I can understand the historical context of LGBT activism aligning with left wing ideals as a means of fighting the evangelical right of the 20th century, but nowadays it really seems like nobody gives a shit about poor working class people completely left out to dry. In fact, a majority of the time, I see self proclaimed leftists actively scorning the uneducated, working class labor force in America especially, usually while browsing twitter as they work their 25 hour week from a cushy stay-at-home coding job.

Enough of my personal opinions though, can you explain where the disconnect comes from? I doubt it needs to be said, but I don't have anything against these communities or, more specifically, individuals belonging to these communities. It just seems like a big waste of time and a way for those in power to keep us distracted from affecting actual change for the betterment of the people without. What are we fighting for, exactly?

328,vwt1na,2022-07-11,stupidpol,[longpost][effort] The US education system is on the brink of total collapse and we're all completely screwed.,"I've been keeping up with what's going on in education because \~children are the future~ and holy shit, we're in deep trouble. The system is currently being assaulted from multiple angles, and while COVID is a major factor in its dysfunction, it's really more of an accelerant for trends that have been ongoing for years. Here's a completely unscientific and non-comprehensive breakdown of why our future generations are going to be non-functional:

#**The Society**

We all know how little trust US culture has in education, so no point in spilling more pixels on it

#**The Parents**  
This section is going to be mostly anecdotal because crawling through parenting publications makes my eyes bleed, but I've been watching this shit go on for years so whatever. Even beyond factors like SES and family structure (for the sake of brevity I won't get into factors largely beyond parents' control), there's a vast body of evidence pointing to the fact that how parents parent has a large effect on what their children turn into. Research consistently demonstrates that children of parents with authoritative [parenting styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting_styles) [have the best outcomes](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407520960818), [including in academic achievement](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10834-015-9444-5), while children of parents with permissive and neglectful parenting styles consistently underperform. It is perhaps these parents that demonstrate the  [involvement and high expectations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1747938X18301027) in their children's education that are also linked to success. 

Ok here's where it gets anecdotal. In my completely unscientific observation, parenting trends have shifted to become extremely permissive (see: [attachment parenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_parenting) which gets completely fucking bonkers once you scratch past the surface). Although it's good that it's no longer acceptable to beat children, it seems to have become normal for parents to attempt to shy away from even mild forms of discipline and thus fail to correct problematic behaviors. Without authoritative (even authoritarian would be better) parents providing their children with structure through a system that mixes reward to enforce good behavior and punishment to extinguish bad behavior, they'll be ill-equipped for the classroom.

But there's something even more pernicious happening than granola parenting- parents are exposing their children to long periods of screen time from a very early age. This poses a serious, serious problem; in [early childhood](https://academic.oup.com/pch/article/11/9/571/2648303?login=true), people's brains rapidly adapt to the environment they're being brought up into -- for example, aboriginal australians develop very strong spatial cognition to survive terrain with few landmarks. Parents who give their children regular access to youtube kids and tiktok are literally, unironically giving their brains permission to permanently adapt to a world of rapidly-changing, oversaturated, narrative-free stimuli. Even the most structured parenting can't overcome that.

#**The School Boards**    
School board positions across the country are typically filled with elected or politician-appointed members that pander to what voters or politicians want in order to obtain and keep their jobs. Despite the fact that BOE appointees don't have to have any understanding of how education works, they hold immense power over the school districts they oversee. Like publicly-traded companies, school boards show their stakeholders (voters) that they're successful through quantitative metrics like operation costs and graduation rates, which, like publicly-traded companies, often leads them to do things to boost these short-term metrics at the expense of meaningful long-term goals. Examples of common and extremely destructive policies commonly put into place to cook the books are 'avoid Fs at all costs' (i.e. shuffling kids along until they graduate barely literate), 'avoid suspensions or expulsions at all costs' (more warm bodies = more funding), and 'create an inclusive environment' (i.e. eliminate SPED resources to save money). 

Of course, they are also increasingly expected to achieve ideological wins that at best do nothing to improve education quality. With education having become ground zero for COVID and culture wars, the true value of schooling to many voters and BOEs across the country (a low-cost babysitting service that hands out good grades and diplomas and doesn't teach anything that challenges what area parents are trying to indoctrinate their kids into) has been laid bare.  

# **The Administrators**

Over the past couple decades, the education system has shifted into a 'the customer is always right' service model. As with school boards, admins are concerned with boosting their quant metrics so that their schools appear to be 'good'. Their preoccupation with numbers like graduation rates, in addition to their fear of angry parents, has made behaviors like [grade inflation](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED598893), [shuffling unprepared kids through the system](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-functionally-illiterate-students-allowed-to-graduate-from-high-school) instead of holding them back until they learn the material (which makes catching up increasingly harder to the point where we end up with high schoolers ([and college students](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/12/16/graduated-not-literate)) who are [functionally illiterate](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2020/10/27/reading-level-math-test-scores-high-school-seniors/3746305001/)) and [refusing to discipline](https://www.live5news.com/2022/01/07/charleston-county-school-district-sued-over-workplace-safety/) disruptive students (who [hinder learning outcomes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775715000059) for the rest of the class).   

Like fresh-faced middle-managers, school administrators are often on the look-out for feel-good trends they can adopt (or pay lip-service to) to demonstrate to parents and teachers that their schools are on the bleeding edge of developments in education theory -- but without making tough, expensive, or unpopular changes that might actually improve student outcomes. In fact, the ways in which these concepts are implemented tend to conveniently cut costs (e.g. special ed staff) or improve metrics (e.g. disciplinary actions) while passing additional burden onto the teachers and tanking education quality for students. A historical example that is now deeply-entrenched within education systems internationally is [mainstreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstreaming_\(education\)), which likely [harms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775721000406) [student performance](https://www.eui.eu/Documents/DepartmentsCentres/Economics/Seminarsevents/Balestra.pdf). A more recent example is [restorative justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice); [extremely hard to implement correctly in the classroom](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-019-01013-2), these programs often amount to admins [allowing students to engage in disruptive or even violent behavior consequence-free](https://isthmus.com/news/cover-story/rotten-year/), with nary a hint of 'restoration' or 'justice' involved.

The burden of executing administrative and school board vision lies almost entirely on the backs of teachers. Faced with feral kids who are often so far behind that they're literally incapable of understanding class material, a directive to prevent kids from failing at all costs, and [job](https://core.ac.uk/reader/345094950) [creep](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/213926/1/2021_EI_Research_StatusOfTeachers_ENG_FINAL.pdf), the role of the teacher shifts from teaching to meeting the ever-changing whims of parents and superiors. But at least administrators ~~force them to suffer through team building exercise-tier bullshit~~ generously invest in their future through [professional development](https://hechingerreport.org/new-report-reveals-that-teacher-professional-development-is-costly-and-ineffective/)!

#**The Teachers**

Faced with disrespectful and even hostile parents, unsupportive admins, stingy and politically-motivated school boards, and hellraising students, teaching is no longer a viable career path. Contrary to the common wisdom that 'those who can't do, teach', a high proportion of teachers -- particularly highly-needed specialists -- enter the field from [other backgrounds](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-teacher-shortage-is-real-large-and-growing-and-worse-than-we-thought-the-first-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/) because they want to help our youngest citizens thrive. If teachers can no longer teach, the profession is treated with disrespect, and licensing requirements (particularly for those much-needed specialists) are [extremely time-consuming and costly](https://www.alleducationschools.com/teacher-certification/)...who's going to want to be a teacher?

You may have noticed that most of the links in this longpost are pre-pandemic. Even back then, [attrition rates and teacher shortages](https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/) were so high that schools in some areas [were hiring teachers from the Philippines](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/schools-in-illinois-florida-arizona-and-colorado-hiring-teachers-from-philippines-to-fight-staff-shortages) to fill in the gaps. With COVID and culture war bullshit to contend with, teachers are now [starting to quit and retire en masse](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/04/teachers-quitting-jobs-covid-record-numbers), and teaching program enrollment [has declined](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/10/28/teacher-education-programs-continue-suffer-death-thousand-cuts) to the point where those positions can't conceivably be filled.

#The kids

They're reportedly quite often little shits who are incapable of engaging in activities that require critical thinking, creative thinking, or attention, but given how much adults are failing them, who's to blame?

#**Predictions for the future**

The deterioration of the public education system (+ parenting) is quite possibly one of the biggest risks to the future of the country. Some predictions for the next decade and beyond:

* **Upward class mobility will be next to impossible for US natives**: Children who aren't placed in high-quality private schools won't have the skills necessary to obtain a college degree. The secondary education system may be faced with relaxing its standards to shuffle people through (which has been happening, albeit at a much slower pace than K-12), thus further devaluing US bachelor's degrees and leading companies that can afford to be discriminating to require more proof of skill (i.e. low- and unpaid internships) before investing in young workers.
* **More immigration will be necessary to maintain economic output in key sectors**: Because we won't produce enough skilled workers ourselves, we'll need to import more skilled workers from developing countries to work in sectors that require both a degree and talent.
* **Young adults won't be able to engage in critical thinking or reading**: This is already a problem that the country faces due to poor-quality parenting and poor liberal arts education, but it'll intensify, which has implications not only for how they think about politics but things like susceptibility to scams.
* **Young adults won't be equipped with the ability to engage in long-term planning**: The aforementioned poor-quality parenting and poor liberal arts education will leave young adults unequipped with long-term planning skills and the ability to delay gratification, leading to an increasing adoption of exploitative gig work and financial illiteracy. This is already happening among zoomers
* **A vicious gutting cycle**: As is the case with other social programs, the deterioration of the public education system will provide conservatives with justification to further destroy the system because why invest in it if it's not working? This is likely part of the strategy for some of the recent state attempts to relax qualification standards.",snallygaster,t2_4vggm,0.95,751,335

367,hfhdty,2020-06-25,stupidpol,I have a theory as to why rural working class people identify more with capitalism than with socialism.,"I lived in a small banana town for a year and a half. I ended up having many conversations about our local welfare distribution center, the character of the people who needed it, and so-on. 

Every day you'd see roughly two or three waves of employees go to work. You'd see the 5am shift, which is when the farm labourers, council workers, and just about anyone surrounding the agricultural industry begin to start their work. 

Then there was the 8am shift, which is when the cafes, banks, shops, schools, and any other indoors, air-conditioned business began to open.

Then there were the casual workers and the unemployed, which generally hung around town during the day without doing anything in particular. 

So if we look at the labour theory of value, exploitation is a dollar earned by an owner of the means of production was a dollar not paid to the worker. When the 5am starters would finish their shift in the afternoon, they'd leave work, go past the shops, buy some cigarettes and some alcohol to relax and they'd see the unemployed hanging around in the parks.

Of course everybody knew that the unemployed were getting benefits, and some were getting extra money to have their students attend a certain number of school days. While the farm workers would see the people who own the farm right alongside them; they drove tractors, fixed leaking pipes, and were workers themselves that happened to own property. While the unemployed owned nothing, and did nothing, and were rewarded with a wage as well. 

So these conservative laborers saw themselves in distinct categories - people who work hard (labourers and business owners) - people who work easy jobs (bankers, baristas) and people who didn't work at all, but still being paid.  Those are the lines that they divide themselves along.

The people who are on unemployment benefits are seen as the rent-seekers that we accuse the bourgeoisie as being. When I defended the unemployment payments and people who didn't want to work, I tried to remind them of the people who earned millions, if not billions of dollars in profit in a given year. There's a limit to how much someone can work, but not a limit to how much they can be paid. 

""Well, it's because they're smart enough to figure out how to make that money in the first place.""

I think they'd be ripe for the picking to be converted to socialists if they were exposed to more examples of the wealthy class exploiting the workers and living off the labour of others on several orders of magnitude more than welfare recipients.

Effectively that means four months because I started mid month, and it's taken weeks to get my insurance plan set up.

Now that I finally have insurance, it has taken weeks to get the supply company to process my insurance and send me my prescriptions that I literally don't know how to live without. When I run out in four days, I will have to switch to shots, which I have not used since I was a child. I also don't have a prescription for long-acting insulin (you don't need it if you are wearing a pump), and I can't get one because I can't get into an endocrinologist in the town I moved to *until March*.

I wrote a long complaint about this issue to her, explaining that if I had not been able to save a backlog of supplies, I would have spent $5,000 on prescriptions over the last three months. This is clearly a diversity and inclusion issue since it only effects people with chronic illness or disabilities, and is a much more material issue than the normal language policing, but since it would cost the company money, they won't do anything about it. She just forwarded my complaint on to HR, who sent me an email letting me know that the three month probationary period ""is legal."" Great, that makes me feel better.

 UPDATE

Thank you everyone for your advice. I  finally got the company to process my insurance and overnight me my  supplies. It turns out they were trying to contact the wrong insurance  company.

Obviously the three month  policy isn't directly responsible for this, but it is responsible for  me almost running out of supplies because I couldn't afford them  out-of-pocket.",TurkeyFisher,t2_wf6ym,0.97,618,145

You can ask me anything about regulatory toxicology, the science behind most environmental and occupational exposure scenarios.","[ACS AMA](http://imgur.com/hoKm4RT)

Hi Reddit! My name is Hans Plugge and I am a toxicologist with over 35 years’ experience working on contract both for government, including USEPA, as well as private industry.  Currently I work at 3E Company in their Bethesda, Maryland office, focusing on regulatory toxicology. During most of my career I have specialized in hazard and risk assessment of complex environmental scenarios. Recently I have done a fair amount of work in so-called green toxicology, the art and science of assessing chemicals as to their “greenness”.


Previous government contract experience ranged from review of nasal carcinogens, particulate matter and teratogens to ecotoxicological impacts from drilling muds. Non-federal government/ industry experience ranged from city government (municipal sludge disposal) to state governments (monitoring lab and Superfund activities) to commercial real estate (sick building syndrome, site re-development and asbestos remediation) to (big) data analysis and QC.  At 3E Company, my industry work includes developing GreenScore, hazard assessment software for Green Toxicology, developing and maintaining over a hundred databases of (eco)toxicological data as well as consultations with industry.


I have a B.Sc. in Chemistry from the University of Amsterdam, Netherlands and Master’s degrees in Environmental Biochemistry from the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada and in Toxicology from the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston. I have been with 3E Company for 3 years, prior to that I was a private consultant for 30 years.


Again I am Hans Plugge, a Senior Toxicologist with 3E Company in Bethesda, MD.  You can ask me anything about regulatory toxicology, the science behind environmental and occupational exposure scenarios.

Deciding then to come to the US, I had to decide first between an academic or industrial track. Choosing the latter, I joined ExxonMobil Corporate Research in New Jersey, where I was fortunate to be able to work on inorganic materials for a range of interesting applications, including ceramics, catalysts, zeolites, and oxide superconductors. I got interested in computer simulation and was then recruited by Biosym Technologies, a molecular simulation software company in San Diego. I had various executive roles, including Chief Scientific Officer, as the company was acquired by Corning, merged with Molecular Simulation, and was acquired by Pharmacopeia (now [Biovia DS](http://accelrys.com/)). I then became more interested in start-up and early phase companies, co-founding [FreedomVoice Systems](https://www.freedomvoice.com/), [hte AG](http://www.hte-company.com/en), fqubed, Integrated Discovery Sciences, Bio4Front and, in 2011, Tioga Research.


I also serve as an [ACS Expert](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/experts/john-newsam.html) an AAAS Fellow and a RSC Fellow; I enjoy teaching entrepreneurship to undergraduates at UCSD and discussing with local middle- and high-schoolers interested in chemistry.

**Edit** Thanks for the great AMA. I have to get back to work but will keep answering your questions throughout the day!

**Edit#2** Thanks for the continued interest! I am going out for a beer but will answer your questions when I get back - they may get more interesting after that . . .

**Edit#3** Answers to FAQs:

- What do I think about asteroid mining?

Asteroids like Bennu represent natural resources of near-Earth space, in the form of water, organics, and precious metals. There is potential for substantial economic development in follow-on exploration of these objects. Water and organics are useful for life support and rocket fuel and therefore would support a space-faring economy. The current business model for asteroid mining relies on a steady customer base for resources such as water and organic compounds in space. Such a venture may be feasible if international interest in space exploration continues to increase. Another angle on asteroid mining is to extract precious metals like platinum and return them to Earth. I calculate that a 10-meter asteroid is worth ~$10-million, with $9M in iron, nickel, and cobalt and $1M worth of platinum. Given that OSIRIS-REx costs $1-billion, we have long way to go before this business plan closes. What we really need to do is bring down the cost of accessing space. 


There are a couple of companies that are interested in asteroid mining and they are looking for talented people. If you are interested, they are hiring.

- What are the chances of finding a harmful bacteria/virus in the sample?

We consider this to be a very low probability event. We don’t expect any microorganisms on Bennu. It is too small and the radiation doses would kill anything living on the asteroid in a very short time. We had to prove this as part of our Planetary Protection rating – which is Unrestricted Earth Return - meaning that we do not have to take any special precautions to avoid contaminating the Earth with extraterrestrial life. Instead, we hope to find organic molecules that may have led to the origin of life on Earth. We will focus on measuring the organic molecular inventory of the samples but don’t have any plans for biological assays. We will keep the sample under nitrogen purge to avoid contaminating it with terrestrial microbes.

- How do I get a job in planetary science or working on a spacecraft mission?

I  describe my initial steps in my [Journey to the Asteroid Frontier - Part 1](http://dslauretta.com/2013/12/06/my-journey-to-the-asteroid-frontier-part-1/) in one of my blog posts with a follow on in [Part 2](http://dslauretta.com/2013/12/17/my-journey-to-the-asteroid-frontier-part-2/). I was introduced to planetary science as an undergraduate at the University of Arizona when I received a NASA Undergraduate Research Space Grant to work on the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. The idea of communicating with an alien civilization across the vast expanse of space inspired me to pursue a career in planetary science. I focus on the formation of planets and the origin of life to understand the likelihood of alien life arising and evolving elsewhere in our universe.

As for young people wanting to get into this line of work - study hard and do well in school. Graduate high school and go to college. Find people with similar interests. Start with the basics – math and physics, then work your way up from there. Planetary science is multidisciplinary and requires knowledge of math, physics, chemistry, geology, biology, etc. Once in college, he should try to get a job in a research lab. Talk to scientists and engineers that are working on projects that interest and find ways to volunteer in their labs. Undergraduate research opportunities are key to getting needed experience for a job in the aerospace industry or for getting into a good graduate school. Be persistent, arrange for tours of local labs, and make it clear that you are interested and motivated to pursue a career in this field. Once you get the job, do it well and show initiative to move up to more responsibility.

I am optimistic about the future of space exploration for several reasons. First, despite budget cuts in recent years, the United States has a great space program with many exciting missions in the future including Mars 2020, the Europa Clipper, and, of course, OSIRIS-REx. In addition, other national space agencies are ramping up their programs including India, China, Russia, and the Europeans. Finally, I think we are starting to see some serious interest from industry in commercial development of space. If these companies take off then planetary scientists will be in high demand.

- What powers and propels OSIRIS-REx towards Bennu and how fast does it travel?

We have two solar arrays to provide power to the spacecraft. We have two Li-ion batteries to store power for periods when we are not in direct sunlight (such as during launch and sampling). The guidance system includes many components including star trackers, sun sensors, a laser range-finder, and on-board image processing capabilities. 
I describe the journey to Bennu, including details on the speeds involved in my blog post [How to Get to Bennu and Back](http://dslauretta.com/2013/11/27/how-to-get-to-bennu-and-back/). We will leave Earth with a hyperbolic escape velocity of 5.4 km/s (over 12,000 mph) on an Atlas V rocket. We will sneak up on Bennu with a relative approach velocity of 20 cm/s (~0.45 mph). When we return to Earth the sample return capsule will hit the top of the atmosphere with a speed of 12.4 km/s (27,738 mph). 

- How much sample will we collect, what do we hope to find in the asteroid sample and how will we analyze it?

The baseline science requirement is 60 grams (about 2 ounces) of asteroid regolith. However, we also have to be able to measure the amount of sample collected before we stow the sample collector in the return capsule. We measure the moment of inertia of the spacecraft both before and after sample acquisition. It turns out that this technique has a measurement uncertainty of 90 grams (3-sigma). Therefore, our sample collector (TAGSAM) is required to pick up 150 grams of material. Under optimum conditions, TAGSAM can pick up two kilograms of material. We have the capability to attempt sample collection three times. However, we hope to get enough sample on the first attempt. The second two are backup options in case the first attempt does not pick up enough material. 

The primary objective of OSIRIS-REx is to return pristine carbonaceous material from the early Solar System. Spectral analysis of Bennu suggests that it is similar on composition to the very rare CI and CM carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. These rocks are rich in organic compounds and water-bearing minerals like clays. We hope to find organic molecules that may have led to the origin of life on Earth and inform the likelihood that life may have originated elsewhere in our solar system. The team’s sample analysis objectives are distributed among five broad categories, based on analytical techniques. These are: mineralogy & petrology, elemental & isotopic composition, organic chemistry, spectral properties, and thermal properties. We use a wide variety of techniques including NanoSIMS, transmission electron microscopy, electron microprobe analysis, mass spectroscopy, gas and liquid chromatography, synchrotron particle accelerators, thermal conductivity analyzers, and laboratory spectrometers.

We are computer scientists and ethicists who are examining the societal, ethical, and labor market implications of increasing automation due to artificial intelligence. 
	

Autonomous robots, self-driving cars, drones, and facial recognition devices already are affecting people’s careers, ambitions, privacy, and experiences. With machines becoming more intelligent, many people question whether the world is ethically prepared for the change.  Extreme risks such as killer robots are a concern, but even more so are the issues around fitting autonomous systems into our society.


We’re seeing an impact from artificial intelligence on the labor market.  You hear about the Google Car—there are millions of people who make a living from driving like bus drivers and taxi drivers. What kind of jobs are going to replace them?

124,43tyhb,2016-02-02,science,"American Chemical Society AMA: Hi! I’m Alex Tullo of Chemical & Engineering News, here to discuss the effect of the DowDuPont merger on the chemical industry. AMA!","Happy Groundhog Day! 

My name is Alex Tullo. I am a senior correspondent with the Northeast News Bureau at Chemical & Engineering News. I have been reporting on the chemical industry for C&EN since 1999.  I have headed C&EN’s coverage of DuPont’s merger with Dow Chemical since this deal was [unveiled in December](http://cen.acs.org/articles/93/i49/Introducing-DowDuPont.html) and have had particular focus on the impact this deal will have on research.
This merger surprised the chemical world. Both companies together, when the merger was announced, combined for a market capitalization of $130 billion. No previous chemical deal had ever even topped $20 billion in value. The new DowDuPont will generate an estimated $83 billion in annual sales, second only among chemical makers to BASF. 


This company won’t last for long. In about two years after its formation, management plans to break DowDuPont apart into three firms. One company will combine Dow’s and DuPont’s complementary businesses in seeds and crop protection chemicals. Another, likely headquartered in Midland, Mich., like Dow, will focus on plastics and other materials. A third, specialty products company, will be based in Wilmington, Del., like DuPont, and will have a portfolio of electronic materials and other value-added products.


The merger has already [had an impact on research](http://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i4/DuPont-Shrunk-Central-Research-Unit.html). Last month, DuPont shut down its famous Central R&D unit and is rolling it up into a much smaller organization called “Science and Innovation.”  Observers saw this as a culmination of a trend at big corporations away from exploratory research in chemistry and towards more business oriented discovery.

I will host a webinar on this topic on Feb. 11 @ 2 p.m. with Bill Nugent, a former DuPont researcher and a visiting scholar at Ohio State. http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/acs-webinars/business-entrepreneurship/research.html

The sweep has now expanded to 40 public scientists.  I was the first scientist to fully comply, releasing hundreds of emails comprising >5000 pages.

Until recently, few people believed the field of artificial intelligence (AI) existed outside of science fiction. Today, AI-based technology pervades our work and personal lives, and companies large and small are pouring money into new AI research labs. The present success of AI did not, however, come out of nowhere. The applications we are seeing now are the direct outcome of 50 years of steady academic, government, and industry research.


We are private industry leaders in AI research and development, and we want to discuss how AI has moved from the lab to the everyday world, whether the field has finally escaped its past boom and bust cycles, and what we can expect from AI in the coming years.

I am currently CSO of Collaborative Drug Discovery, CEO of Phoenix Nest, CEO of Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, Inc and CSO of the Hereditary Neuropathy Foundation and I am on the Editorial Board of Pharmaceutical Research.  I am a graduate (MSc, PhD, DSc) of the University of Aberdeen. I have spent 20 years working in the USA, first as a postdoc at Eli Lilly, then as a senior scientist at Pfizer and Lilly before joining smaller start-up companies. I then went on to co-found and found two rare and neglected disease companies.

My background is in clinical pharmacology, with an interest in understanding drug-drug reactions and toxicology. I quickly moved from doing bench work to learning how to use computational approaches to make predictions that could help drug discovery.

Over the years I have collaborated with different academics and companies to build models that help predict how compounds bind to enzymes, transporters, ion channels and receptors. As the datasets have grown I have applied different machine learning approaches.

My work in the last 8 years has brought me into working on neglected diseases like tuberculosis and rare diseases such as Sanfilippo syndrome and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Again collaborations are central to what I do. Virtually everything I work on is funded by a grant whether from the NIH, EU or others so even though I am not working in a university I am constantly working on small business or other grants.

Most recently my work has led to projects and collaborations on the Ebola and Zika viruses. All of this has been published openly and I am an advocate of open access publishing as well as using social media to publicize science. I believe it’s important for scientists to use tools like Twitter to tell the world about their work, conferences they are attending and publications.

In a nutshell, we like to pursue problems whose solution can have a rapid impact in areas that are important to modern society such as the invention of new pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, or materials. 


Our general philosophy to making complex molecules in the laboratory has been summarized in multiple locations but suffice it to say we are aiming for syntheses that are as close to “ideal” as possible. With regards to inventing methodologies we like to focus on tangible and practical ways of forging bonds that are meaningful to as many folks as possible. In that regard, we are most enthusiastic about solving specific unmet needs in reactivity that have a high likelihood of being “translational”. Finally, we like to collaborate as much as possible with industry as the fastest return on tax payer money happens when fundamental science and real-world problems come face to face.

I work to reduce bycatch in U.S. ocean fisheries to ensure that our fisheries remain sustainable and that protected species are given their best chance to recover. What is bycatch and why does it matter? Find out here – Ask Me Anything!,"Hello Reddit! 

I'm Lee Benaka (Fishery Management Specialist, NOAA Fisheries Office of Science and Technology). While U.S. fisheries are among the world’s most sustainable, bycatch is a complex, global issue that threatens the sustainability and resiliency of our fishing communities, economies, and ocean ecosystems. NOAA Fisheries works hard to minimize bycatch in U.S. fisheries, ensuring our fisheries remain sustainable and protected species are given their best chance to recover. 

Bycatch occurs when fishermen catch and discard animals that they do not want, cannot sell, or are not allowed to keep. Discarded catch represents loss of opportunity for fishermen and too frequently, loss of marine life, which can impact vulnerable ecosystems and slow the rebuilding process for overfished stocks or place protected species at further risk. NOAA Fisheries works with fishermen, scientists, and managers to mitigate the negative effects of bycatch by developing innovative fishing gear and tracking bycatch through regular data collection. 

Bycatch is an issue that impacts the overall health of our oceans and the sustainability of our seafood industry. If you want to learn more about bycatch and how it can be reduced, this is your chance.  I'll be back at 10 am EST (7 am PST, 3 pm UTC) to answer your questions, Ask me anything!

246,177hc7o,2023-10-14,MensRights,White men are actively discriminated against in the job market right now,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm a 32 year old white male in the tech industry. Specifically PM work. I was let go in the mass layoffs months ago by a major tech company that all of you probably know of. I have been in multiple interview rounds with good companies and I have never seen the market this bad for white men ever in my adult career.

Just to preface without sounding like gloating, I have a good resume with solid experience from desirable companies. I've had a number of interviews, and for the positions I want, most hiring managers/majority of panel interviewers have been women, either white or minorities. And oddly enough, every single time I reach the final stages of the interview process and I find myself interviewing with one of these women in a position of power, I get a swift rejection email.

I am cordial, well spoken and friendly. I received two offers from interviews, with the hiring managers/majority of panel members being men but unfortunately they are not companies I am very interested in.

**Two alarming trends I have noticed in tech are that being a white man is an instant negative for most companies**, especially if you find yourself in front of a panel of women or a hiring manager who is a woman. Women are also being promoted to these HM positions in much less time than their male counterparts.

**The other is underqualified women are getting these jobs that white men are competing for at increasing rates.** I checked back for the roles I was rejected for that have been filled and, unsurprisingly, all but one of them were filled by women with less experience than I have.

Just wanted to let other men (white men specifically) that are struggling know that you aren't alone. You don't meet the quotas that these companies have and you are playing against a stacked deck. This is the worst I have ever seen it, and I can only assume it will get worse. I have spoken with close friends and they are experiencing the same thing.

White men are being discriminated against in the job market and nobody wants to talk about it.",EntranceSafe96,t2_lq98byj35,0.91,819,201

251,6uumes,2017-08-20,MensRights,Fuck office politics: newly arrived female coworker is in difficulty with her work and is attacking my reputation behind my back. WTF???,"The reason I post here is because many of the things this coworker does she can get away with it because she's a woman, and she's blatantly using female shaming tactics (people may not agree with the fact these are female tactics, but I think they are), *in the workplace*, to get her way...

She had a task: do her job and learn ho to do new things. Me (and others) supported her. After a few months I no longer had the obligation to support her and I realized she was slacking on purpose (facebook, amazon, chats, etc, instead of working). She... didn't like that. Because she had decided *not* to learn anything, when push came to shove and she needed to deliver, she went mad and started using the only coin at her disposal to fight the situation: social group, gossip, men-hating.

She started attacking me behind my back, trying to ruin my reputation. Her reasoning was that our boss was pressuring her to deliver, she didn't know how to do the job (spent months without applying herself) and because I was capable of doing it, *I had to drop everything for her*.

To quote her (a coworker showed me this):

- ""why doesn't Demian do it instead of me? He's the only one who knows how to do it anyway..."".
- ""I'm stuck with this, the *client* is an asshole, it's not clear what I have to do... of course it would be a lot easier if Demian supported me, but he never helps me...""
- ""this job is shit, can't do it... talk to me about your weekend :)""
- ""I asked X to give me a hand, I'm waiting for him. I watched this cool movie last night...""

Again and again, complaints in private to her friend (one of the PMs) in order to get someone to tell me to do the job *for her*. Never mentioning how she was told, when hired, that *she needed to learn this stuff*! Only implying how she's willing to do the job but my lack of support is blocking her (false and shameless accusation)...

She decided by herself that team work meant she was excempted from every responsibility. This is an example of a chat conversation:

- SHE: demian, you are not busy, right? :)
- ME: I'm busy, sorry.
- SHE: eh... you are doing research... can't you help me with this?
- ME: sorry, but I can't help you. Try to take it slowly and face one problem at a time, you'll get there.
- SHE: but I need someone to show me how it's done...
- ME: and I sent you lots of material months ago, I can't do the job for you..

She grabbed the last message and send it to four different women and a guy so they could support her in bashing me.

I had to protect myself after that. I intervened with certain coworkers and made sure my version was known. After a few days, she made so much noise and her work was so behind that my boss asked me my opinion on her and her work. 

Because of what she did (the chat convo was just one occurrence of her gossip), I sunk her in front of my boss. I spent almost 8 months without saying anything negative about a coworker (her!) in order to avoid putting her in a difficult spot, and what does she does?

She targets me because I don't go over mountains for her (where does the entitlement come from lol????) and decides to fuck with my reputation, just because she was lazy and had to choose between admitting her lack of knowledge to my bosses (damage to her image) or use social games to blame *me* instead (damage to *my* image)...

-------

Right now, I was promoted and next month I'll be in charge of her work. At the moment, she latched onto another coworker, constantly ""asking"" him how to do things, constantly ""asking"" him to look up stuff for her by saying ""she doesn't know how to do the job..."", and implying he has to because of ""team work""...

While the guy looks for stuff up, she opens her chat or facebook and starts doing random stuff or talking with her friends, waiting for him. And the spineless guy refuses to say ""no"" to her, is depressed and overloaded of work all day, and earns even less than she does...

And by the way, whenever the guy can't cope with it anymore and snaps at her, she starts gossiping behind his back telling everyone how this guy is having his ""ladies days""...

The three of us were on the same role inside the company, but unlike us, who focused on the job, she focused on her relationship with the others. At first I thought this wouldn't be an issue because we are all different, until she started using that ""support group"" she formed to backup her up on her lack of skills and all her BS...

Fucking office politics. And fuck women who blatantly push to establish social bonds with other women and then use gossip to get their way against men who actually work and don't give a crap about this stuff...",demian78,t2_ax22xax,0.89,934,219

Feminists will die on the hill of men have all the power and opress women.

Most men are complacent, sexless and one unemployed month away from bankruptcy. But these men are invisible to the modern woman.

What about the working man? Does that man wake up at 6am in the morning to go pick up garbage, to fix the broken roads or to repair a few trucks think ""oh well i will go to work today for minimum wage so i can continue oppressing these women yay male power""
No. He thinks ""I will go to work so my family can have warm meals today""

Every time I have this sort of discussion with someone I take a look around me and usually end up poiting at a working class man and this often shuts up the other person for good.
Because deep down they understand the struggles the average man faces yet everyone is lost in feminist liberal propaganda so the line is very blurred.

--------------

There is evidence of a growing number of men, who avoid women in the workplace, avoid being one on one, avoid mentoring women. This hurts women. 

https://nypost.com/2019/05/17/men-are-afraid-to-mentor-women-after-metoo-and-it-hurts-us-all-study/

I read a number of articles on that topic. Another example:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/pragyaagarwaleurope/2019/02/18/in-the-era-of-metoo-are-men-scared-of-mentoring-women/

There is a common pattern. Authors ignore and dismiss concerns of men, they give their own explanations of the experiences, feelings and motives of these men, in condescending and scolding manner and shift the topic to empowering women, defeating bias against women and improving career opportunities for women. So basically men should shut up, stop whining and do their best to help women advance. I'd say, it is basically womansplaining.

I know, that feminism is about women's issues, not about troubles of men. That's fair enough, I totally accept this approach. So let's assume these papers are supposed to fix the problem for women, defeat the backlash against metoo. However, let's see what kind of message does it deliver to these men, who are afraid of women at the workplace? 

Men aren't listened to. Their concerns and point of view are ignored. Men aren't entitled to be treated with dignity and feeling of security. Men are an instrument for the advance of  women... 

So if a man is afraid of women, he receives a message that his fears are completely valid.

Edit:

So. How would you approach that problem (men silently ignoring women, because they are afraid)?",WanabeInflatable,t2_16k72e,0.97,1711,370

\- no touching besides introductory handshakes

\- I NEVER comment on their looks, this applies for both positive and negative comments. I don't even do it when they are not around.

\- I never talk about dating or sex with/around them.

There, its that simple. I followed these rules since I started working and had 0 problems or complaints so far.

In my eyes the not following these rules is a risk not worth taking, especially for unattractive guys like myself.

I've heard my female coworkers calling guys creeps for merely attempting what I would judge to be ""corporate friendly"" and politically correct flirting. It only takes one willing to escalate things beyond gossip to ruin your livelihood.

272,ppkfjn,2021-09-16,MensRights,I was sexually harassed by a woman at work. I reported her to her male superior and I was crucified.,"I was hired to work in a profession where more men are needed, simply because many women do not want to do some of the work involved.

My immediate boss was a pushy woman who did not understand the concept of boundaries. For example, she made telephone calls at all hours. I immediately make friends and one of the people I got very friendly with was a woman - we totally had no romantic interest in each other - and she acted more like a drinking buddy.

For some reason my boss did not like to see this friendship. For example every day, I had lunch with my female friend. But my boss warned both me and her that we were spending too much time together and I needed to spend time with people who were more knowledgeable in the work we were doing.

My boss started to call me over to her office on the pretense of explaining something or asking about progress on some project I was working on but she started flirting a lot and this involved her putting her hand on my thigh, near my crotch. Her language was also vulgar and amongst other things she made 'jokes' like asking me what size shoes I wore because according to her penis size is related to shoe size.

I sent her an email, copied in to our male, gay manager, outlining her behaviour and why I thought it was inappropriate.

I was horrified when I was fired but doubly so when she reported me to the police for lying about her and tarnishing her reputation! Incredibly the police are taking action against me.

Edit: Please understand that I cannot give more detailed information such as location etc. Others are asking me questions like what can the police do... etc. But I would rather not reply publicly as it might compromise my position and my future course of action. I thank you all for your support.

273,odi2ma,2021-07-04,MensRights,"""Emotional labour"" is the term women use when they emotionally abuse men.","After reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/lums86/woman_realizes_shes_been_accidentally_abusing_her/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), I started thinking about the all too common story of the husband who has no self-confidence left. Reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ocxwrc/why_are_so_many_women_unaware_of_the_emotional/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), however, really set me off to writing this post.

""[Emotional labor](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/emotional-labor-in-the-workplace/202004/emotional-labor-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not) is the regulation of one’s feelings at one’s job."" Although, as acknowledged by the article linked, the meaning has been stretched to mean, ""[Women planning things.](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/)""

Both cases of ""emotional labour"" (and all other cases that include its stretched definition) have one thing in common: an abusive woman.

Picture this: You're a husband who works a job, and are trying to help around the house. Good for you, right? Except, before anything else, you'll be [berated](https://www.katykatikate.com/the-blog/2019/5/7/so-you-want-to-help-around-the-house) for not being a perfect mind-reading magician and doing so earlier. 

Then comes the fun part: Nothing you do will satisfy her. You'll be scolded and called ""incompetent"" for getting the tiniest of details wrong. You're not good enough, and you never will be. Not unless you read her mind perfectly, because she can't bother explaining things to you; she shouldn't have to.

Any confidence you had in yourself is gone, and you stop doing those things you wanted to; you always get them wrong, anyways. This is the real kicker: Now you'll be blamed for not doing enough. You're now a lazy bum, a manchild, a mama's boy. You depend on her for everything, and she can't take it, so she takes it out on you. ""I don't have to ask you to help! You should know already!"". That's the part that gets you. ""You should know already."" You should already know what she needs help doing. You should already be doing the thing. You should already know exactly how to do the thing, to the last detail. You should already know all that, and the only reason you don't is because you're not good enough.

But oh no, you're not the victim in all this; she is, because she's doing the ""emotional labour"". Stop thinking your feelings are valid; they're just a manifestation of your ""fragile male ego"" that ""needs constant appeasing"". She doesn't need to caress your ego. You need to be the man she needs you to be, because you're not good enough.",Hey_itsmeguys,t2_a3edilh8,0.86,1725,314

in full disclosure, i'm a white male, in a creative industry that is being regulated and run by media companies with a heavy woke agenda. i've been working my way up the ladder for 15 + years now and i'm constantly seeing job offer listings with the heading ""(BIPOC) preferred."" make no mistake about it, media companies have an agenda to hire diversity. AKA, anybody but WHITE MALES.

women and people of color are being hired with no experience and being promoted up the chain overnight, something i've been working years to achieve. Further, the older white male bosses, know they're in the cross hairs and can be cancelled any minute and are terrified they are going to lose their rarified high paying job, and are as one boss told me ""making me hire"" diverse candidates, over ability, loyalty and experience.

It's not only the corporate media initiatives on the hiring side, but it's also the content - the content is all about women issues, with trans subject matter. So if you have netflix, hulu, disney, etc. you must notice that all your content is starring women and about women's issues and LBGQT subjects, etc.

Nevermind that Top Gun - an arguably patriotic, male, testosterone, action movie has done billions of dollars in GLOBAL revenue for these same companies.

You'll notice the jobs i'm speaking of are not -- plumbers, construction, electrical, truck driving, HVAC -- fields that women have no interest in, that require specialized skill and intensive labor. These are creative jobs where the only SKILL you have to have is be able to feel and relate as a woman or diverse person of color. Experience, skill be damned. The question USED TO BE ""what experience do you have?"" now the question is ""what gender and ethnicity are you?""

Further, my bosses on my last shows were ALL WOMEN (making million dollar salaries). so the notion that women are being subjugated and oppressed and dont have any mobility or opportunities, is patently false.

if i'm my own critic? hey it's social darwinism.  the times are changing, bud!  and get used to it, pal! The patriarchy is over!

but it's a tough pill to swallow. And I am angry and fed up. i'm just a guy who works his ass off and is being pushed to the back of the line because of my gender and skin color.

I'm not sure what to do. I feel like i have to leave my dream and go elsewhere. Become a grey man and disappear. But it's happening. and I'm not sure how to adapt. But I'm in boiling water now and i dont expect it to change.

277,11asgcb,2023-02-24,MensRights,Women need to be called out on their hypocritical use of sexuality in the workplace,"Why does nobody has the balls to call this out?!

Women use their sexuality in work and work related settings ALL THE TIME. When they want a favor from a coworker, when they need help, when they are looking for a raise or promotion, when they are trying to get a new client/customer.

I had several dates with highly successful beautiful business women and they all laughingly admit of flirting and leading coworkers or clients/customers on in order to get that sale, promotion or just get it ""their way"". Had a date where the female CEO said if the client is a man, she sends one of her hot employees, always. And i myself -of course- over the years first hand have seen women get all girly and sexy, start using their cute girly voice when they need a favor or whatever. Its so blatant and normal, everyone knows it.

Yet women flip the fuck out when a man tries to be flirty or tries to use sexuality in their favor. They act like its an  unthinkable immoral crime that needs to be punished. If you ask women if sexuality belongs in the workplace, they all say ABSOLUTELY NOT. Yet they use it every single fucking day. Hell women told me they dress sexier for clients when they want to get a deal/sale. They flirt, they drop sexual suggestions only to later shoot the man they led on down. This all would be fine...if they weren't hypocrites that literally try to cancle and destroy men who dare to flirt back or god forbid initiate a flirt.

Coworker or customer flirts with woman at work = Oh god look at that creepy piece of shit. He should be reported and fired, this doesn't belong in the workplace.

281,b04wtm,2019-03-12,MensRights,Lost my job because I was targeted for being a white male,"I'm a 33 year old white male, and I am a mental health counsellor. I worked on a team with 4 other females, all counsellors/social workers/etc. On that team was a 23 year old who made her opinions about men very clear. Back in August she presented my manager with a list of things that I had said that offended her. I had no idea I was saying anything that offended her. There was about 6 things on this list, and many of them were just me expressing a different opinion than her. It was certainly never my intention to offend anyone with these opinions, and they weren't racist or sexist or derogatory. I've shown this list to many people, including many women, some of whom said they disagreed with some of my opinions, but none said they were worth complaining about. What's worse is this individual took the things I said, and twisted them, either misquoting them or taking them completely out of context, to make me look a certain way. I don't think she did this intentionally, I do believe this is what she heard me say as my words went through her filter. 

She took it to the manager, who is a female and has also demonstrated having a negative bias towards men. For this reason, I was not offered the chance to tell my side of the story; I was ignored when pointing out that I didn't say these things the way she is saying I did. I was offended, and pointed out to my manager that other people on the team, including the woman who presented this list and my manager herself, have made comments that I could have complained about should I have wanted to. My manager has also commented on my appearance more than once, which is sexual harassment, and I reminded her of this (although I didn't put it that way). I stated that I felt this was incredibly hypocritical, but it didn't matter; I was sent to anti-racism anti-oppression training, one-on-one with a trainer chosen by my manager. I showed him the list, told him my side, and he said, in his professional opinion of doing this for 20+ years, that he felt I'm being singled out and I'm being sent to this training to be ""fixed"" so I'll go back to work, shut my mouth and be quiet. He believed this was a team issue being turned into a me issue, and I agreed. This was in September. In November we met with this trainer as a team. It was uncomfortable. I expressed my fear of sharing an opinion that someone disagrees with lest it be held against me at a later time. But we did the training, and things went back to normal. My working relationship with this young woman was never the same, but it was civil. 

Flash forward 3 months, when I am sitting in my office waiting for my first client of the day, and my manager and an hr rep entered my office and told me I am being let go because I ""don't fit in"" and that my ""views are better suited elsewhere."" It was out of nowhere. I had been so careful with everything I had said since August. I received no warning, no investigation, no opportunity to fight for my job. It was decided.

I have dedicated my life to helping others. I do not discriminate against anyone, quite the opposite in fact. I help individuals of all genders, sexual orientations, races, religions, ethnicities, ages and so on. I help many people who have been discriminated against, oppressed, or stigmatized. But I was on a team with a 23 year old female who only ever saw me as a white male, and she targeted me, and she was successful. She has had an impact on me financially, on my career, and a severe impact on my mental health. I hate her, and I hate my biased manager who handled the situation different than she would have if the roles were reversed. This is a scary time.

Edit: I should have mentioned I consulted an employment lawyer. He is a friend of a friend, so I trust him and his advice. He said that although I likely have a case of discrimination, he strongly suggested I don't take legal action on the basis of discrimination, due to the fact that I am straight, white and male. He said that win or lose the case, it would reflect bad on me, particularly in the field that I work in.

The list:
-age (she was the youngest on the team by 10 years. Myself, and the rest of the team, would occasionally playfully tease her about her age. I never once put her down because of it. At a team meeting she asked all of us to stop it, and I know I did. And yet, it still made the list) -he said that questions about power and privilege on interviews are useless (in fact, I said ""I didn't see the point"" but I was referring to one specific case, but that's a whole other story. But she generalized it, and that was not my intention or meaning nor my words) - mat leave (the women on the team were having a conversation about how the US was cutting parental leave time and were talking about how sexist it is. I said I don't think it's fair to call it sexist because, although it disproportionately affects women, it affects all genders who would take parental leave) -said he wanted another male on the team; ""there are too many of you and only one of me"" (at a team meeting we were talking about hiring a new person for the team, I suggested we consider hiring another male as some clients request male counsellors specifically and because I felt it might add some more diversity to the team. I was often shut down very quickly if the women on the team did not agree with my opinion. I certainly did not say the words she put in quotation marks) -you look nice (said to her ONE TIME in the year I worked with her before she gave this list, because she got dressed up for a presentation and I was just trying to be nice. I didn't think anything of it. I certainly wasn't hitting on her or flirting with her, and again, it was a one time occurence)
-he is aggressive when his point is not agreed with and does not take into account other people's feelings (in fact, I would often be shown aggression from the females on my team. When I suggested hiring another male, the 23 year old snapped at me ""you can't say that!!"" and she clearly did not take into account my feelings. But of course that doesn't go both ways)",Jzurb,t2_vip53,0.95,3035,500

######Credit: u/FelineQuinine

Notice how 93% of workplace fatalities are still men.  A fact that men apparently do not get compensated for.

~~The math is pretty simple, though not obvious at first:~~

~~$1 / ($1 + $0.77) = 0.56~~

I think this shows pretty clearly what the largest factor in the earnings gap is.

Of course the fact that men have to work longer hours than women is itself a problem. Paying for dates and bills for your girlfriend / wife isn't exactly cheap. Not to mention that many women look for men who earn more money, thus creating an incentive for men to sacrifice their work-life balance in order to earn more.

I guarantee most men would love to work fewer hours and spend more time at home but the spending and earning patterns of their partners don't often facilitate this.

This also contributes to poorer health outcomes for men and the fact that men die 5 years earlier than women on average.

**Edit:** Graph is fine, title is misleading.  The 77 cents per dollar thing is likely just a colloquialism at this point.  The graph itself is showing total hours worked for all workers, part time and full time combined.

I’m not joining the club. 

I can’t take you seriously if the word entitlement isn’t paired with responsibility. Start explaining what you are responsible for. 

I don’t care if you wear a bra. Why is this still a thing ? Do what you want. 

I don’t need to hear anything related to your reproductive cycle, we are not a couple so why do you feel like sharing publicly. Sharing is not caring. Your body is your business. 

If you take the time to creat list and be thoughtful do it silently. Telling others about the emotional labor you endured takes away from any generosity you supposedly offered. 

If women are still too sexualized it’s because too many of your sisters are looking for  a short cut. Deal with them, not me. 

If a man shares a thoughts or a feeling let him finish it. Talking isn’t a competitive sport. Emotions are real and not icons in your chat app. Let a man express himself  once in a while. And listen once in a while. 

And lastly, if men are so bad why do you glom onto them as if they are owed to you. No man owes you anything, least of all a relationship if he isn’t ready for one. Or if you are not the one.

377,n0jarm,2021-04-28,MensRights,All female management and HR forced me out of the company after reporting harassment,"This happened three years ago at a small company and it still has been weighing on me. It was one of those ""we're one big family"" tech companies who prided itself on having beer in the fridge and a ""great culture"". 

The management structure above me was my lead (female), mid level manager (female), direct manager (female), and department head (male). The HR department was 3 people (all female). For what it's worth, I am also an ethnic minority and all the women in management were white women. 

Myself, a female colleague, and another male colleague were all up for a promotion. The only one that walked away with a promotion was my female colleague, despite myself and my male colleague being there far longer (I actually interviewed and made the call to hire the person who was promoted). The company had a formal list of criteria needed for a promotion, so I created a list with evidence for every bullet point and sent it to my manager. She refused to even glance at it and told me my accomplishments were not relevant. Weeks later I pleaded with her to go over this document and discuss my career goals. She flipped out on me, called me all kinds of names, and then stormed off. 

I went to the head of the department and explained what had happened. He was shocked at the behavior and had no idea what was going on in the department. He scheduled a meeting with the three of us and she tried to lay into me again, but instead her boss chewed her out for unprofessional behavior. He then saw my list of accomplishments and decided I was definitely in line for a promotion and I was promoted not long after, along with my male colleague. I thought it was over. Boy was I wrong.

A few months later the department head left the company and was replaced by a female department head (so the entire management structure was female). My boss held a grudge and it was open season on me now. But this time she stepped over the line and harassed me over email with direct language about a disability I have. This is blatantly illegal so I went to HR. 

They immediately defended her and tried to gaslight me. Everything I said they tried to counter, until I presented them with the harassment in writing. I stood firm and knew my rights and they backed down. What transpired after that was 6 months of retaliation (I spoke to a lawyer and he said there's not much you can do until they fire you). 

Constant belittling, talking bad about me to other coworkers, turning people against me. Every 1 on 1 meeting we had was recorded (something she never did to anyone else). Every time I pushed this up the all female chain of command it fell on deaf ears. Eventually I left the company, just like they wanted. My position was filled by my boss's female friend. I am told by someone that still works there she had been badmouthing me behind my back for over 2 years.

Keep in mind this is a company where other female employees openly said they discriminated against men. They host and sponsor feminist events. They openly say their pride themselves on hiring women. 

When I reported my manager for harassment, it was me against a clique that openly made it clear where they stand, and that stance was firmly against men.

405,3gpv60,2015-08-12,MensRights,My men's rights tee designs were labeled 'offensive' by TWO screen printing companies in less than 24 hrs,"First of all, this is a throwaway account for privacy reasons and I'm sorry if it's against the rules. I know my experience is nothing compared to the literal horror stories that have been posted here but I just felt I needed to get this whole thing off my chest.

So I started thinking about opening an anti-feminism online store some time ago. I hate all these feminist slogan T-shirts that are everywhere nowadays. I wasn't familiar with the screen printing process but I figured I'd use the service of companies which handle that for you. And so I went for it. Boy, I was in for a treat.

After I'd created the shirt designs, I started looking for a screen printing company. I didn't expect there to be so many options to choose from, so I spent some time researching. There were two or three companies that kind of dominated the industry but they charged more than the rest just because they had more bells and whistles. 

This put me off as I couldn't afford to pay for unnecessary stuff. My first choice was a smaller company that I hoped would offer more of a personalized service. So I created my account, uploaded my designs and continued the work on my online store. However, the next day I was notified my designs were apparently in violation of this site's rules and qualified as offensive. I re-read their policy and while I did not agree that my designs [(here's a few examples)](http://imgur.com/a/mRjzb#1) were in any way abusive or offensive, I decided to let it go and use another service. I figured any arguments at that point would be meaningless.

Now here's where the real fun starts. After going through the entire process again - filling out forms, uploading designs etc. - I received a termination email of sorts from the second company too! This time it wasn't even some pre-written template. It was sent to me directly by the owner of the service, basically telling me to go to hell because of my 'ridiculous' views.

[Screenshot.](http://imgur.com/a/mRjzb#0)

A proud 'fefminist'? She must've been so mad that she started mistyping words and stuff, lmao. Acting all outraged by the fact that people are selling men's rights apparel. Because that's reserved for poor oppressed feminists only, right? But who's the oppressed one really? Again, my designs were in no way abusive!

Her condescending tone admittedly pissed me off, though the fact that she came off as an illiterate moron kind of amused me at the same time. It was frustrating mostly because I had to start all over several times but I tried not to get worked up about it and now I'm close to finishing my project with another company.

Everything I thought about feminism was true. It isn't about gender equality at all.

For the record, I have not mentioned any company names because I realize how passionate this community is. I don't want to feel guilty in case any companies/websites receive some sort of backlash due to my comments. Sure, I think they might deserve it to a certain extent but I also don't wish to affect their source of income even if their handling of the situation was questionable.

EDIT: To the guys who think I should post the companies' names: I appreciate your opinion, but it's not happening for the following reasons:

1) I DID submit personal details to both services. Some people have already called me a coward but I've had personal dealings with raving feminists before and I do not wish to go through all the bullshit again. Especially online. I don't have the time and I don't need the drama. If you feel I'm letting you down, sorry.

2) Whatever I've shared here, they will simply deny, so what's the point? It's their word against mine, except that it's also their company.

3) The companies are small enough that I can almost guarantee you won't be unfortunate enough to stumble upon their services unless you were very, very specific. If you're looking to get an online tee business going, don't make the mistakes I made and just go to a major company.

As far as the shirts go: as I mentioned in the original post, I'd considered working with one of the big screen printing companies to finish my store but after reading through the comments and doing some additional research, I'm going with an on demand fulfillment service. It's more convenient and I hope it won't take too long because I'm going on vacation soon. But more importantly, the process is completely automated so I won't have to deal with any more morons online. It costs more but I probably won't make much money either way, so fuck it. This way at least I'm saving some time.",crop-me-out,t2_nv6lw,0.95,787,281

Women complains that man keeping it professional at work makes her and other female coworkers feel uncomfortable","The other day I was bored and started doomscrolling on Reddit when I found this post on r/relationship_advice 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/10yx39j/a\_colleague\_at\_work\_27m\_of\_1\_year\_refuses\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10yx39j/a_colleague_at_work_27m_of_1_year_refuses_to/)

Essentially the post is about how some dude in the office (27M) won’t speak to OP (24F) and the other women at the office. He won’t talk with them about anything other than work with the girls, but is friends with the guys. However, he is cordial and will exchange some basic pleasantries (have a good day etc). In other words, he is being a normal coworker and OP doesn’t like that.

Now here’s the twist. OP said that one of the girls is considering go to HR about this because she is saying its creating a hostile work environment. This is the part that really pissed me off. Now I acknowledge that maybe the majority of women aren't like this, don't generalize blah blah blah I get it. However, it's not that every woman will, but that any woman can. This is the exact same situation as the google manager in a thread that got posted a while back where the guy got fired for not responding to a female coworker's advances. So the idea that this is an impossible scenario is simply false.

There is simply no winning anymore. Now if you follow the Pence rule, you can be punished for that to.   Act friendly with a woman and ask her out or show interest, and you get punished or fired for harassment. Okay. Men adapt. Now, you act professional with a woman, and her and her friends get upset that this is a hostile work environment and want to report this to HR. If a man does A he gets in trouble. If he does B he gets in trouble. If he reverses course and does Z or Y he gets in trouble as well. If he says f the system it's all BS and goes MGTOW, then he gets labelled incel, misogynist, sexist.

It is promising however that pretty much everyone in the thread called OP out for her total BS, but the simple fact that a group of women would even think to do this is just insane. I suspect (this is just my opinion) that the man is attractive, she showed interest, he says no thanks let's talk about work, and she takes it personally and builds a *hostile work environment* in her mind because she can't fathom that someone doesn't want to be best buddies with her *at work* and just wants to be professional. More attention-seeking bullshit. Nobody is entitled to friendship to anyone, but somehow this is too much to comprehend for some people. Imagine being so fragile that someone not being your best friend makes you feel uncomfortable. It honestly seems to me that she and the other girls at the office are harassing him. Rules for thee but not for me. I shoot you for no reason, but I am the victim.

Imagine if a group of guys went to HR and said, ""we feel upset that a female coworker at the office won't talk with us"". They would be annihilated. This is just complete delusion.

If everyone is to be paid the same, tests should be gender neutral. This would also account for genders other than male or female that people would like to be identified.

Physical fitness test should be cater to the job, not the gender. Military is a profession, not a welfare program.

This webpage, although a little outdated, gives a brief outline of the scoring standards for fitness tests of all US military services. ([https://mybaseguide.com/military-fitness-tests/](https://mybaseguide.com/military-fitness-tests/))

The one for the Army is a little outdated. The former test, APFT, was gender discriminatory. The new test, ACFT was initially supposed to be gender neutral. Then they changed it to where the scoring would be gender neutral, but females would get more promotion points for the same score. Then they changed one component of the test, from the leg tuck to the plank, and also made the scoring gender discriminatory. The most recent scoring for the test is ([https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/acft/ACFT\_scoring\_scales\_220323.pdf](https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/acft/ACFT_scoring_scales_220323.pdf)) .

I also hold the view that physical tests should also be AGE neutral. In the case of jobs or ranks that don't require high physical standards, make the physical tests less demanding ( a General doesn't need the same physical fitness as an infantryman/infantrywoman/infantryperson ).

FYI, the intelligence test for the US military is called the ASVAB, and is gender neutral.

For the argument that females bring skills other than physical fitness, if any such skill is important, it should be measured in a gender neutral way.

In case they need females for a specific task, a temporary limited exemption may be made (example: Cultural Support Teams that were useful in Muslim countries).  But a service wide exemption is unfair.

For the argument that females are generally less stronger that males and that should be accounted for: There is no reason to give special exceptions to any category. Why don't we categorize by height then? Why not by eye color, or hair color? What about gender makes it necessary to categorize by that? Also, combat is gender neutral.",jacare_o,t2_14fj8j,0.85,1961,307

>I work in a very male dominated job, and so do a few of my female co-workers.  I've discussed this idea with them, and none of them are advocates of women's rights like you read on the internet, or hear about radical feminists.

There's no special rules for harassment, because we all harass each other, we all play jokes on each other, we all call each other names, it happens.  The feminists live in a world where they create this pseudo-oppression for themselves, and blame it on men.  Subsequently they feel the need to try and take rights away from men.  Equality for women is already here.  Feminists don't want equality, they want power.

&#x200B;

This LinkedIn study from 2019 used their internal data to examine differences between men and women when job searching. Among the key findings are the fact that men and women view a similar number of jobs though women apply to 20% fewer. A recruiter is 13% more likely to view a man's profile which she described as result of a problematic bias that must be corrected (even though they also found that recruiters will still contact both genders at equal rates).

However, the author (Maria Ignatova) makes no effort to hide her own bias (and sexism) by writing:

>The good news is that when women do apply to a job, they are 16% more likely than men to get hired. In fact, if the role is more senior than their current position, that number goes up to 18%.  
>  
>While this is an uplifting stat, it does show that women do a very thorough job at vetting roles — sometimes maybe too thorough. If women only apply when they feel extremely qualified, this could also indicate they are not pursuing stretch opportunities.

Linkedin is a mainstream website, not a fringe feminist blog. Yet blatant discrimination in hiring practices is celebrated as ""good news"" and as ""uplifting stat(s)"". This doesn't lead to equality, it's just another piece of evidence that equality isn't the actual goal.

Her analysis is also very weak and uses the usual strategy of reframing all issues so that women are the real victims. I think a more plausible hypothesis for why men apply to 20% more jobs is because if we are getting rejected more often then we need to submit more applications to increase our chances of finding work. Of course I would submit fewer if I was getting offers at 16-18% higher rate.

For most of us, this is just seeing statistics that support what we already knew is happening. The worst part is just being gaslit, and told this is ""equality"" and if we have a problem with it we are misogynist or examples of ""toxic masculinity"".

I live on the property of a private boat club, the property is gated, fenced, and has no trespassing signs all over. I live here to keep non-members out of the property as we are located on the water in a large park. 

Tonight I come home from work and do my walk around the property, as I do everyday, and I came across to young women sunbathing on one of the docks. I asked if they were members, they said no, and asked the to politely leave because this is private property. That's when they started to call me a perv, they can do what thay want, on and on. I am a very level headed person and let them rant and I calmly assed them to leave. They called 911 and screaming that some creepy old perv was harassing them. 

After a few minutes the police show up. Two female police. One goes and talks to the girls, the other talks to me. I explain to here that I live here and it is my job as caretaker to keep people from trespassing on the property. All the while the girls are getting all emotional with the other officer using words like creepy, they felt threatened, rape, the whole 9 yards. The 2 officers talk alone, then come over and cuff me risk me, take my wallet, phone, and keys, then seat me in the back of my car while they check my background and a warren search. All the while the two sunbathing girls are all giddy about me being in cuffs and taking my pic and text/posting like crazy. 

After about 15 minutes they take me out of the car and cuffs, and tell me I am free to go. (Go where? I fucking live here!) They then ask the girls, who are pissed that I was uncuffed, if they wanted to file a report against me, but they would have to leave the property. 

So for doing my job, on private property where I live, I end up in handcuffs for being considered ""creepy"" by doing my job. 

The officers never asked me if I wanted to file charges against them for trespassing.....of course.

I spoke to the board members of the club and we agree that in the future I should just call the non emergency number for the police and to record it. I also contacted a member who is a retired from the state supreme court and she told me ""that is utter bullshit"" as to how I was detained and she is putting a call into the police chief.

So this afternoon was low at work and I called the CPD internal affairs division to find out the status of my complaint against the officers.

is a very proud feminist. I am the only male in the class. This is a small college so she is teaching the entire program. The man bashing was getting out of hand and I had enough. So I wrote her this email regarding some of my issues in the class:

Hello R\*\*\*,

I am not happy in your classes. I feel that it is the duty of the instructor to present the material as unbiased as possible, and as a proud feminist you do not do that. These issues are not new, I have been feeling this way for a long time. However, it was on Wednesday of last week that I reached my breaking point. In my twenties I may have identified as a feminist, but I’ve grown since. I do not support the feminist ideology. I believe in equal rights, but “woke feminism” is a joke at best, and very dangerous at its worst. I realize that you are very passionate about your feminist beliefs, but I am not, and I do not want to hear it in the classroom any longer. I have requested several times to transfer to another class however B\*\*\*\*\*n is not responding to my emails. I can no longer sit quietly on this. Until they can find another class for me to join, I will be joining your lectures, but I will do minimal participation. I will not answer questions, and my camera will be off. Topics such as mansplaining, manspreading and the pay gap are non-issues. Mansplaining is a feminist tactic to silence men, manspreading is due to biology, the pay gap is due to the difference choices that men and women make. To pay someone differently for the same job with the same qualifications is illegal and every time they look for it in the West, they repeatedly find men as the underpaid gender, if it exists at all. Just look at what happened with women’s soccer in the US and the BBC in the UK. There is no Patriarchy, just a hierarchy based upon competence, with the most competent rising to the top. And that is just the tip of the iceberg.

Feminism is an ideology based upon victimhood and I will not be a part of that belief system.

It is because I like and respect you that I am writing this email. If it was not for that, I would not have returned.

One last point, men make up 95% of war casualties. The ones that do survive are traumatized, disfigured and never the same. To say that women and children are the biggest victims of war, was deeply offensive. If one considers all people as equals and you can still regard women and children as the biggest victims of war, something is very wrong with your reasoning. Most of those men that died; died protecting our borders so we can be safe and enjoy our lives in peace. Do not discredit their sacrifices. None of them wanted to die, but that was the cost of our freedom.

Sincerely,

My professor's reply was sent through Bongo. Our classes are all online. I didn't realize that Bongo does not automatically save private messages. The gist of her reply was that she apologized for making me feel uncomfortable in class and she wants to talk with me face to face about my issues with the class. I actually have a good relationship with the professor. I do have the support of all the students in the classroom. The day of the incident where she was particularly man bashing I commented that there was ""too much man hating going on"". The rest of the class either apologized or came to my defense.

There is enough evidence that I could get her fired for sexual harassment. Everyone in the class is aware of how she is.

456,tcyo1p,2022-03-13,MensRights,"Australian report by feminist organisation claims support for men's rights is a ""significant barrier to gender equality""","This report summarises a survey of Australians with regards to attitudes towards gender equality and was conducted by a feminist organisation which is, as they all are, solely focused on things like getting more female CEOs and more women elected to political office.

There is some good news in the report and the feminists must have burned in anger at having to write it. For example:

>**Men have been forgotten in the struggle for gender equality**  
>  
>Our survey reveals a worrying statistic in this regard: nearly half of all male respondents “agreed or strongly agreed” with the statement that “gender equality strategies in the workplace do not take men into account”. If we disaggregate the data by generation, we find that while millennial and builder males were most likely to report feelings of being left out, all generations exhibited similar sentiments. Millennial males were also significantly more likely (48 per cent) to “agree/strongly agree” with the statement that “Men and boys are increasingly excluded from measures to improve gender equality”, followed by Gen Z males at 44 per cent. Gender equality measures are not the only interventions that are perceived by men to deepen, rather than fix existing inequalities. The highly contested concept of freedom of speech also reveals significant gendered differences, with men far more likely to say that political correctness benefits women in the workplace.

This section is surprisingly revealing of feminist motivations. I'm surprised they would include this in a public report:

>**Male moderates are champions of men’s rights**  
>  
>The moderate perspective combines an egalitarian set of views around gender equality in the workplace and at home with rising concern over what they understand as the growing impact of political correctness in Australian society, as well as a strong desire to see men’s rights equally represented in public discussion of equality issues. Given that 62 per cent of Australians align with the moderate position and its value system, this represents a significant barrier to gender equality.

Got that?

Feminists think that concerns for men's rights and a desire to see men treated equally to women are an obstacle to feminists achieving the goals that they dishonestly label ""equality"".

Other stats cited include:

* 41% of Australian men believe that political correctness gives women an advantage in the workplace
* 46% of Australian men believe that gender equality measures do not take men into account
* 42% of Australian men believe that men and boys are increasingly excluded from measures to improve gender equality

The feminist authors fear that these popular and growing attitudes could result in a ""backlash"" against feminist initiatives and ""backsliding"" away from the goals which they're pursuing.

Of course, any time that feminists are unhappy or even hysterical it is good news for men and for progress towards true equality. I see this report as quite positive.

I work in sales and spent the majority of yesterday walking through 10 floors of a large company for an assessment. By the end of the day, my feet felt uncomfortable, but I didn’t think much of it. Fast forward to today - as I was taking my shoes off to put them on the shoe rack, I noticed the ones I wore yesterday.

This stopped me in my tracks. Working in a male-dominated industry, I've felt pressure to conform to certain beauty standards, often at the expense of my own physical well-being. The walkthrough took 3 hours, accompanied by two men. There were moments when I walked in front of them, particularly while climbing flights of stairs, and it's hard to believe this went unnoticed. Where's the humanity?

More than that, I've often been put in situations where I've been expected to endure whatever bullshit I'm facing, not just at work but in life as a whole.

1.) Almost immediately after a car accident one morning, I had to Uber the rest of my way to work. I was already a little shaken up, but once we got to the office, the driver kept demanding my phone number and became increasingly hostile the more I would tell him “no”. 

2.) I took a commission-based sales job but only lasted one week. The reason? There were actually two. The first one being a guy getting in my face and attempting to grab the company tablet I had in my hands. He just laughed when he noticed I was scared. The other reason was because another guy had kept trying to touch me inappropriately. These two incidents were on the same day. I went back to the main office and resigned after the second one. Fun fact about this one, my significant other at the time actually got angry with me for quitting this job and we ended up getting into an argument. 

3.) A guy, presumably in his 50’s-60’s, accosted my friends and I in a mall parking lot, making explicit remarks towards us. We were only in middle school. 

I’m sure there are other stories I could share, or that have been completely removed from my memory.

A job is a job, and everyone deserves to be treated like a human, no matter what job they do.

Frequently, it's rape of a minor, and the fact that the only two options in this debate are ""all porn is vile evil mysoginistic exploitation"" and ""all porn is good porn and if you criticize the industry then you don't see sex workers as humans"" really bothers me.

Married women everywhere dream of men who take charge and make them feel loved because in real life they spend all day caring for their husbands and families. It’s not a popular genre among women because it represents real life, it’s because its a complete inversion of the way most heterosexual romances work.

491,y6g1ab,2022-10-17,Feminism,The Amouranth situation should change people's mind about sex work,"Throwaway because I have coworkers on my other account and I don't want this controversial opinion known in my work place.

&#x200B;

Let me preface this post by saying this : I believe that sex work is work, I believe that sex work should be decriminalized  because that is the only way to provide a safe environment for the sex workers, an environment in which they feel safe to report assault. However, I believe that sex work, like any other type of work under capitalism, is exploitative. But, there is an added layer of misogyny thrown in the middle. Most sex workers are women, most sollicitors are men, most pimps are men, and I don't think you can analyze this phenomenon outside of the patriarchal lens. Therefore, I can not, in good faith, repeat the slogan ""sex work is empowering"", I believe the vast majority of sex workers are abused, and I abhore the liberal feminist way of glamorizing sex work, especially to impressionable young teens.

&#x200B;

If you don't know who Amouranth is, she is one of the top twitch streamers and if i'm not mistaken, one of the earliest to start the Hot Tub streams. She also has an OF and has been making over a million dollars a month on both of these platforms. She is what many would refer to as an independent sex worker, she's not working with a porno production company, she is her own boss and has people working FOR her. Yesterday, she went live on twitch and revealead live and with proof, that she has been abused by her husband of 7 years, that HE was the one to force her to become The Amouranth that we all know today. She was even forced to keep their marriage a secret because it would ""damage the brand"" according to him, it was kept so secretive that not even people who have met her and streamed with her multiple times knew about it. Basically, she had been trafficked this whole time, while being used as an example of someone who willingly performs sex work, being evidence that sex work can be empowering.

&#x200B;

This situation was the final nail in the coffin for me, I have kept the possibility that a few sex workers may be doing this with no brainwashing and no coercion, but after everything that came out, I can not, in good faith, entertain this possibility. Amouranth had a documentary done on her in which she stated she was happy with what she was doing out of her own volition, so I can not help but wonder how many other sex workers who do it out of their own volition are lying about it. 

&#x200B;

Now, this isn't to say that we shouldn't believe them, or stop them from doing it, I am not even blaiming Amouranth for lying about this, and I absolutely unequivocally stand with her, she is a victim of abuse and deserves all the support she can get. My argument is about the bigger picture, feminists can not continue to defend sex work as a respectable arena for women, it is abusive, dehumanizing, and dangerous. Here, we had the case of a woman who seemed to be doing it all on her own, coupled with the statements of several former sex workers, the glamorization of places such as OF needs to end. We need an honest discussion around the topic, I understand that many believe that if we state how exploitative sex work can be, we're going to be contributing to the stigma and therefore danger that sex workers face, but I believe there is a way to stand up for sex workers, without dragging more gullible young victims into this dangerous job.",Ok-Target-349,t2_tfyd4f1h,0.94,873,164

541,18wnt0m,2024-01-02,Feminism,"Not all men, but all women","(I don't know how well I'm going to get my point across but I'll try) Every feminist discussion regarding male violence against women and girls is flooded with variations of this sentiment. The main fear of the ""not all men"" demographic is that every man would be punished for the deeds of a few, right? Some of them even assert that they are already being punished. That they are afraid to talk to women or work with them. 

But women have always been punished for the violence that men enact against us. Collectively. Here are two events that have happened in the past month:

[A state in India proposed to ban late-evening coaching classes. The ban applied specifically to female students](https://scroll.in/latest/1059678/wrong-at-many-levels-social-media-users-decry-up-ban-on-late-evening-coaching-for-women) It was revoked after criticism, thankfully. 

[Taliban puts abused women in jail to ""protect"" them](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67724424)

These are particularly egregious examples but how removed is this mindset from the rest of the world? These legal measures are directed specifically at women when it was far more logical to apply them to men.

When ""metoo"" gained popularity:  
- 21% of men said they would be reluctant to hire women for a job that would require close interaction (such as business travel)  
and  
- 19% of men said they would be reluctant to hire an attractive woman.  
[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/29/men-women-workplace-study-harassment-harvard-metoo) (BTW: Taking this into account, doesn't ""we are afraid to talk to women or work with them"" come off as a threat?)

Once we realised that women face sexual harassment and abuse, the response was to punish *them*. To restrict their careers.

I know I'm not saying anything new. Imagine curfews aimed only at men (or stricter for men). Men being slut shamed for drinking, partying with the opposite gender or for the way they dress. Imagine a country where men are the ones who are not allowed to work outside the home or go out without a female chaperone. But it's the other way around. Rules are always made for women to ""protect"" them. Every woman's career, social life and freedom in general is compromised. 

**Women are collectively punished for the deeds of men.** No law specifically targets men, like in the two articles I've shared above. No institutes are openly threatening to not hire men in response to a social movement.

So do the notallmen men think this is fair? Are they speaking out against this? Notallwomen too, right?",identitty_theft,t2_5lzmdyue,0.96,732,100

I stopped shaving my legs at the beginning of 2020. I have PCOS and thick hair so I have more leg hair than some men (my partner is one of them). 

I hate how women are seen as gross and disgusting for having natural hair which is there for a purpose. Women are pressured to shave their legs to appease society even if they hate doing it. I feel this myself. I am still too embarrassed to show my hairy legs in my home town. I'm a very well known face in my town due to the job I do (I hate this and am working on moving town and changing job). I can't bring myself to not care and not care about the gossip. I fear comments and judgement.

It is not normal in today's society for a female to have armpit and leg hair. It boggles my mind. It's nature and men can have it! From some googling it seems like fashion magazines told us we had to and society blindly followed until it was normal and weird for women to have hair. This brainwash happened so fast and has stayed so long. 

Female shaving serves absolutely no practical purpose other than to appease society. I notice it's so much easier to stay warm with hair legs, naturally because that's why it's there. I am saving so much money and time. I couldn't go back to shaving now. 

On the topic of attracting partners. Well purely from my experiance many men pretend they care but they really do not. I was single for a few years waiting for someone special but I had lots of casual sex. I was rejected on dating apps for my hairy legs less than 50% of the time. It seemed they were just happy to get some pussy. Many men would stroke my hairy legs after we had sex. Probably because it was a new experiance. I haven't had many female lovers but they really didn't care including on dating apps. 

I was always upfront about wanting casual sex and having hairy legs. Maybe this would have been different if seeking a relationship. 

My current male partner is bi. He said he doesn't care. He said he'd be a hypocrite if he liked men with body hair but not women. We live our happy hairy lives together. I love his hairy chest and back. He helps trim my pubes when they're very long because I can't see what I'm doing. I personally feel more hygienic with trimmed pubes. Gosh I hate it shaved though.

567,17mm64i,2023-11-03,Feminism,"A former sex-workers perspective on dark femininity, marrying for money/finding a ""provider""/finessing""/bimbofeminism etc","I just want to preface this by saying  that I have done sex-work ""light"". I used to work as a stripper and phone sex operator so I am in no way saying this to shame sex workers or the women I am talking about.

But something that really concerns me is the rise of *movements* that involve helping women to get *money* out of men or *manipulating* men (as written in the title) and how it has become mainstream and popularized to the younger generation.

While I don't  think its a bad thing for women to channel and share their wisdom, I am afraid that many don't realize that this kind of advice like ""how to get a rich husband"" uses techniques from sex-work and implicitly mainly IS for women that in some shape or form work in the sex industry. Even though the content creators  don't say that out loud.. So its not a way of life and many teenage girls will never work in the industry or even come close to be in those environments.

But now that that ""transactional mindset"" has become popularized I fear that many teenage girls will actively seek out a ""benefactor/provider"" or a ""sugar daddy"" thinking they will make easy money. What they don't realize is that by doing that they will  attract rapists and other very harmful men.

The kind of men that are willing to pay girls for their time or give expensive gifts have ALL bought prostitutes (I can PROMISE you that, especially the rich ones) and for me prostitution IS rape because you can't buy consent. These men are also *comfortable* with objectifying women and *like* that dynamic they are *used* to that dynamic.

What many of these content creators don't tell you is also the extent of what they had to do to get that money (and I get it because it's shameful and taboo). But for me I could NEVER go into early retirement  because  the money I made as a stripper was simply not enough. The elefant in the room is that the BIG money comes from doing prostitution and fulfilling weird fantasies and fetishes . Nothing is for free and the rhetoric that ""you can get a birkin bag for just being cute on a coffee date"" is simply unrealistic.

I have talked to many strippers that just wanted to work for a year but got sucked into the industry and ended up working for ten years and now, that's the only thing they can do and they are miserable. Not to talk about the trauma of being a sex-worker and how it fucks with your mind and perception of yourself.

I am just afraid that we are grooming a whole generation of young women that don't ""need"" to go into sex-work for lifelong trauma and objectification of themselves. As a stripper I never believed the bullshit the men were telling me about ""providing me a better life"" I got in and out before the industry had a chance to crush me. I would even argue that the strip club is far safer than seeking out this privately or on your own. Some of the men I saw other strippers give lap dances to were generally frightening and I can't imagen what they would have done if they were alone with these girls.

Please can someone confirm I'm not crazy - this is, in fact, blatant discrimination in the hiring process and blatant sexism? Right?

Luckily upper management was impressed with this young woman who was discriminated against and she got the job, despite this other woman actively discouraging them from doing so. But no matter what, the fact that she discriminated against her and that she also was so brazen as to admit that behavior casually to me (also a woman!) is disgusting.

For my part,  I told her it was discrimination, it was wrong to do that, men DO have feelings (but often feel afraid to express them bc of people like her), and women are all different and multifaceted people and cannot be lumped into one category of being ""too much drama"" and that's a hurtful and false characterization of women.

Women’s lack of education also weakens a society in times of an economic crisis or war.  So it seems irrational any way I look at it. What are the reasons? I understand that any sexist policies of the past were largely based on an irrational belief system, but some customs did have a logic to them, even if flawed. This, to me, just seems purely emotional.",nothingbetweenus2,t2_hlesexnog,0.95,464,110
642,1ajt193,2024-02-05,Feminism,Unpopular Opinion: Women (at least for a few years) NEED to be alone,"I was reading ""A room of one's own"" by Virginia Woolf where she basically argues that women need money and independence to write. It got me thinking about something that could be somewhat controversial which is that in order for a woman to meet her full potential she NEEDS TO BE ALONE. Like she needs to live alone. I'm not saying away from her parents, no man. I'm saying no roommates or anything. I feel like society grooms women to feel dependent on other people and counter intuitive.

When you're in a relationship you're going to be affected by that person. You literally can't help it, you are affected deeply by the people around you and your environment. I think women really need to figure shit out by themselves. We also unconsciously seek validation from those around us because again, in the passed we were told that our value and success is based on getting validation from those around us. And specifically in the workplace, while men are simply validated based on their work performance, women are forced to seek validation in their demeanor, the way they act, the way they talk, the way they dress, to be respected.

I know some of you might disagree but literally think about it for a second. At any time in your life when you were around other people do you not think that you could've thrived in a setting that was completely controlled and managed by yourself?

Also to add: This is coming from a woman with a middle eastern cultural background, and what fuels this argument for me is the fact that in the Middle East, its not culturally accepted for a woman to be alone. They live with their parents until marriage and then move in with their husbands. Subsequently, women in the Middle East are pushed into societal expectations of being a housewife. They are typically not pushed into career excellence but rather they are taught to be a good housewife and mother. I see a strong correlation with the lack of physical independence and the societal expectation for eastern women to be dependent on men for their entire lives.

Update: more thoughts- I think taking a year or two to live in your own space, be secure in yourself and figuring out exactly what you like and don't like without the influence of others and just learning to be completely fine by yourself it will completely change your outlook on life. **With all these romantic comedies and romance novels and the fucking love songs 24/7 getting popularized, women (as I've seen on social media) have started feeling incomplete without a relationship and it's pushed us into this feeling of loneliness and a never ending quest for love. But when you live alone until you find that perfect sense of contentment and stoicism, when you think it's time to go on and start looking for a relationship, you will not lower or sacrifice a single fucking standard because you'll KNOW a relationship isn't the center of your life and men aren't the center of the world. You'll start seeing relationships and dating like men do, which are commodities. They're nice to have around, they make life easier, but they aren't a necessity by any means. That's how men see us. The only thing they feel like they need from women is sexual gratification. So they're in zero rush to find someone and they will fuck everyone and their mom over without skipping the beat. And they're confused when we ""care too much"" about things that they don't think matter.  When in truth, society has pushed this narrative on us so severely that our lives are empty and bland if we're single and not exploring anything.**

*Update: I'm going to address the financial side of this since a lot of people were concerned. Of course I know that it's a financial strain to have to live alone and it's just not possible for many people. My argument is that* ***If*** *you have the option between living with others or comfortably living alone, to choose the latter. And people have commented saying that while working 3 jobs they were happier and more comfortable living alone than when they moved in with other people. I agree. Before starting a family I would work 4 jobs if it meant financial independence and the chance to see that I'm an individual as opposed to someone's daughter or someone's future wife and mom. It is so so so important to get to know yourself in that way. Also I feel like the counter arguments don't understand that you're trading some comforts, financial wiggle room to buy more shit, travel, etc. for your own comfort at home. If you financially rely on other people there is this weird imbalance where you feel the need to compensate emotionally and it's just exhausting. Fuck that. Take at least a few years, in your 20s before you get married where you're not in a relationship and you live life on your own terms. If you're living on your own terms you don't need to spend time and energy pleasing others, which is what we're taught is all we have. Instead we can redirect that time and energy into self improvement- thriving-meeting our full potential.*
